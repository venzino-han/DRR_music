100421,10332,19874,"Look, it's a departure from what they used to be. And this one is not as bad as when they had Noemie. Not that Noemie was bad, there were a couple of classics in there, but we all skipped through most of them, unlike with Geike. But who can replace Geike? I don't think the boys need to. There was a time for that, and the guys just want to move forward and evolve, and I can dig that. And this new one is good. I like it. Badaboum is an instant classic, we all know. And the rest are all very smooth and easy to listen to. With Noemie, a lot the stuff were dark, the lyrics were dark, and that was perhaps what didn't click.",1483488000,4

Now for me, I'm a Lynyrd Skynyrd fan. And of course, no matter how good these young hipsters are, they ain't no Skynard.  But then again, who is?

Overall, this is likely some good music considering it was written and sung after 1979.  And you can't blame anybody for being born a generation too late.  I guess.",1483488000,5

100567,15460,13116,"If i can give disclosure's latest release a 4.5/5 i would.  I was very close to giving it a 4/5 review, but I found myself comparing this album with the last album.  A lot of the negative reviews comes from disclosure unique sound that was very upbeat and different.  This endeavor utilizes many styles that are popular in today's EDM realm.  Especially when the Weeknd is a featured artist on this album.  Not to say that's a bad thing, but they have went a little ""mainstream"" for this release.

I don't think I'm going to purchase this album on vinyl because it doesn't have the hard hitting, fast paced, up tempo, party tracks as the first one.  When I mix for people I want them to have energy and feel alive.  Caracal is an album that you listen to when your home alone and want to groove.

Last thoughts:  not all of the album has a mellow feel, there are tracks that are more upbeat, but they are very thin throughout the album.

4.5/5 stars.",1483660800,5
100568,16229,3922,"""FAB""ULOUS! Pretty much a comprehensive selection of Beatles songs from the later years 1967-1970. I have to tell you that these remastered CDs sound much better than those of the 1993 CDs that came in the jewel cases. You should get these if you do not have them already!
The packaging, well, it is considered eco friendly, and it is pretty nice. The only thing is to get the CDs out very carefully and handle them just as you would any DVD or Blu-ray disc. I did not have any problems handling them myself.
It also comes with some really nice liner notes. THIS is how the CDs should have sounded way back when in 1985 when they first started to appear in the music industry. However, with anything technology oriented, better systems, etc. will be in the future for better sound quality.
I prefer the stereo CDs to the mono CDs that first came out. That is just me. I did not grow up listening to mono music.
My formidable teen years were in the 1980s, so CDs were all the rage and every well known group that ever existed couldn't wait to rerelease their music on that format.
With 80 minutes on the audio format, The Blue Album could not be put on 1 CD. You have to wonder about The Red Album, though, but to maintain continuity with the original release, they kept it a 2 CD set to match. All good as the songs are the same.
The song selection is a good one, but you can't possibly put every single hit song the group ever did on 2 CDs.
Apple Records knows that if you love The Beatles, you will get there CDs no matter at some point.
Just look for the best deals and don't settle for the overpricing of some retailers like B & N. Their pricing is outrageously overdone.

Doesn't matter, because if you are and have been a Michael Jackson fan of his music, you will get this along with his popular 4 albums that he started his solo career with.
""Off The Wall"", ""Thriller"", and ""Bad"" are all in Deluxe Editions by now and sound better than ever before. Get this edition while you can or you may want to get the one that was released after this with the 3rd CD. Depends on how much you want it or want to spend. There are good deals out there, so do some research pricing.
What I did like is that if you don't have these albums mentioned, you can basically get much of the albums popular songs on this particular set.
With the exception of Thriller, you will love this CD set!

We're heading into a brand new year full of new and unexpected adventures, some difficult, even hard, sad, happy.  We lay awake trying to solve the unsolvable. We cannot control our future, only our Heavenly Father God can do that.  Our Savior, Jesus Christ who is God the Son, was sent to earth on a mission of mercy - to save us from our sin, and self.  In His humanness,  He got weary, needed sleep, needed food- He knows our frame and how weak it is.  Heb 4:15  For we do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but was in all points tempted as we are, yet without sin. Heb 4:16  Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need.
This song embodies the encouragement that Jesus is not unaware of our trials and temptations.  The Ball Brothers have also recorded this one, but I chose this one because it was the original.",1483660800,5

100580,17279,19882,"It's hard to re-create the way people heard Coltrane at the various stages of his career, now. Monk, early Miles, ""Kind of Blue"" Miles, ""last tour Miles"", early quartet, ""Love Supreme"", ""free jazz"", ""late free jazz""; it's hard to disassemble the composite we have, in the same way it's hard to disassemble the various stages of Beethoven. But it's probably true that critical reception thinks of Coltrane as a very demanding soloist who pushed the boundaries of harmonic structure and broke them, without much consideration for the listener, who hadn't yet learned how to listen to this stuff.

This record was a last block of music that was easy to listen to, at least for people who were already listening. At the same time, it was the Coltrane who'd become hard to fit into even something as innovative as Miles Davis' ensemble. Here's someone who really worked through those changes! But not to the point of being difficult, at least for those who liked serious music.

Coltrane was, in fact, at least to my ears, the most moving of the ""balladeers, much more to my taste than, say, Ben Webster. Ballads are hard to define, and not all of the pieces on this record would fit into everyone's definition, necessarily, but there is nothing that requires a stretch, so to speak. And none of it goes as far as the Johnny Hartman record, which can be heard by many listeners as plain sentimentality.

I don't know that there's an all-purpose place to start with John Coltrane, and I dare say that some listeners, even jazz listeners, might simply never pick up on him. But it seems to me that this record would have the widest appeal, and the most instructive, as it seems to point to the essence of Coltrane's oeuvre more directly than the Johnny Hartman record, and is less likely to alienate than the ""Love Supreme"", something most listeners should probably avoid at the outset.

This ""deluxe edition"" to which I've attached this review is really for the connoisseurs only; the second disc, all aside from presenting an odd bit, a piano-tenor duo version of ""They say it's wonderful"", is mostly repeated takes of the quartet version of ""Greensleeves"", better known from the Africa Brass Sessions with ""big band"" coloring, and ""It's easy to remember"". These will not be boring to someone who listens to Coltrane a lot, but are unlikely to be anything but tiresome to a less committed listener. ""They say it's wonderful"" betrays a certain uncertainty in Coltrane's playing (not Tyner's), and for that very reason has a certain special appeal. Again, for someone who hasn't already become an aficionado, it won't appeal much. Listen to it on the Johnny Hartman & Coltrane record instead.",1483660800,5
100581,10138,17405,"This is the second Bob Dylan album in a row where he sings pop standards.  It's a very good album.  Some people don't like Dylan's voice, but they just don't get it.",1483660800,4

100583,6684,16151,"""Santigold's third studio album, ""99 Cents"" is a great album full of flavor and style. The only song I have a problem with is, ""Who Be Lovin' Me"". I don't know who this Ilovemakonnen dude is but he's a terrible singer. His voice is so flat and monotone. I can't tell if he's singing bad on purpose or what? I don't know what Santigold was thinking. Ugh. Too bad because the song has a great beat. Anyway, I do enjoy the rest of the tracks but I think her last album, ""Master Of My Make-Believe"" was much better. ""Walking In A Circle"", ""Before The Fire"" and ""Outside The War"" are a little draggy but I like the eerie quality and production. ""Big Boss Big Time Business"" and ""Banshee"" are the most experimental tracks. ""Can't Get Enough Of Myself"", ""Rendezvous Girl"", ""All I Got"", and ""Who I Thought You Were"" are the most traditional new wave tracks and they are absolute stellar. Definitely the highlights here. These 4 songs are loaded with sunny melodies, catchy hooks, and awesome synths. I LOVE the pop gems, ""Chasing Shadows"" (love the handclaps and children's choir) and ""Run the Races"" which is a beautiful, haunting ballad. I also want to mention that Nick Zinner of Yeah Yeah Yeahs plays guitar on ""Outside the War"" and ""Run the Races"". He's a talented guitarist. I really like Santigold. She's not predictable or cookie-cutter. How many black female singers make new wave music? Not many I can think of. She's been around for a while now, and I still feel like more people have no idea who she is and that's a shame. BUY. THIS. NOW. Enjoy!",1483660800,4

100615,17282,12601,"This was my first 21P recording experience. Below is my first listening reaction.

I suspect that like many I WishListed Blurryface based upon seeing 21P on SNL where they performed Stressed Out and Ride... two very different, very strong tracks with impact and appeal to burn. I was intrigued by the ""newness"" (to me) of the sound and the personality of a bass/piano & drums duo albeit backed by an 8-ish piece string ensemble and an unseen synth lurking somewhere. Of special note was the strength of the drumming vs. past ""power duos"", e.g., White Stripes and Black Keys.

While a couple other tracks approach the SNL two's level, none quite achieve it and others don't come all that close. The reggae influence is present in more tracks than I was expecting. Its use give a feeling of ""sameness"" to some tracks... not a bad thing... just a bit impact diminishing. A couple other tracks were simply ""pop-ish"" and seemed more out of place approaching filler material.

I was very impressed with the SQ of the CD. Everything was clear, clean and well placed in the sound field. Even the most rapid rap riffs were understandable to even my old, non-rap tuned ears.

Bottom Line: Even with the lesser material this is still easily a 4-star listen with enough good material to keep me from having to justify the price based on two outstanding tracks. While right now Blurryface will not send me running to 21P's catalog for more purchases with repeated listenings it may well grow on me.",1483660800,4

100648,9114,19885,"I have been studying yoga nidra for many years. As a result, I have sampled many different programs. This is clearly one of the best. It's calming, confidence building, deep, and supremely restful.
 If you're interested in trying other yoga nidra programs,  I would suggest ones by Maalika, swami Janakananda,  swami J,  and one you can get through a podcast on iTunes called Elsies yoga. Go to episode number 62 which is called yoga Nidra or deep relaxation. The first 15 minutes she's chatting with a fan. You can fast forward through that or listen to it. The program is incredibly restorative, balancing, and relaxing.
Yoga nidra,  like all meditation, gives you deeper benefits over time. Yoga Nidra is also incredibly helpful for insomnia. Both kinds, the one where you find it difficult to fall asleep and the one where you wake up in the early morning hours and start ruminating. If you use yoga Nidra with earbuds or headphones the experience is even deeper.",1483747200,5

This version, disco version, is an infectious version that differs only slightly from the original version; it has more solos than the original one, but other than that, it's basically the same.  If I were to recommend a song from the Barry Manilow library, it would be the disco version of Copacabana (At The Copa), just because it has a wildly infectious beat and you can almost picture everything happening while the song plays.  Great song, great artist!  I would highly recommend this artist on Amazon.com/digital music where I purchased the single at.  Hope you enjoy!",1483747200,4

100785,2460,16847,"Once again, Steven Wilson twiddles the knobs on this, the sixth album from the amazing prog rock group Yes. I can really only report on the audio CDs, as my bluray surround system has to be replaced. Wilson's remix of TFTO is very crisp and clear, and all of the instruments and voices stand out much better than they once did on vinyl and in the primative days of when the compact disc was brand new. The Rhino/Elektra remasters were a step up from the previous issues, and included run through versions of THE REVEALING SCIENCE OF GOD and THE ANCIENT, with slightly differet/unfinished lyrics and a few alternate arrangements. These tracks were retitled DANCE OF THE DAWN and GIANTS UNDER THE SUN. (which are the subtitles of REVEALING and ANCIENT). Wilson's version includes similar bonus tracks, however, the lyrics and music are more loke the final masters. The remaining bonus tracks are Wilson's imaginary single edits of all 4 songs, with the RITUAL edit done in two parts. Of course, no single was ever released from TALES. Yes had finally stumped the executives at Atlantic Records. The original album consists of four movements, averaging 20 minutes each, taking up four sides of a two record album set. For those who already know and love TALES, this is either in your home or on your wish list. And if Santa didn't come up with the goods, go get it. But keep your Rhino versions for the studio runthroughs with the muffed up lyrics, and the LOUD arrangement of the LEAVES OF GREEN section of THE ANCIENT. Wilson's is the highest quality version yet. I can only imagine how the 5.1 mix sounds. If it's anything like the FRAGILE and RELAYER mixes in 5.1 that Wilson created, they are going to blow every Yes fan away!",1483833600,5

That way I can listen to (and sing along with) all those wonderful voices that Robert Shaw gathered together regardless of which side of the continent I happen to occupy at the time.

100844,17309,19893,"I would be careful with this collection.  The songs themselves were well chosen, representing the big hits of Foreigner.  However, they really did a lousy job in giving you album versions.

Most of the songs were either redone or shortened versions.  Hot Blooded, for instance, is only 3:08 here.  On the original album, I have it running 4:30.  The song I Wanna Know What Love Is runs short--it is supposed to be 5:01.  And they do not sound quite right--even where the time is long, it is because it is a new recording.  Better to pay a little more and get a different compilation.

Too bad, because Foreigner is an excellent band for those who like rock but not thrash metal.  The 5 albums this was compiled from are all worthy albums, and I would suggest either getting cuts directly off those albums or picking a different greatest hits album.  There is nothing past 1984 on this album--you will not find anything off their 6th album or from Lou Gramm himself (itself not a major flaw because you can only fit so much material on a single disc without charging more).  But I am not a fan of re-recorded material unless you hate the execution of the originals but not the original songs.",1483920000,2

100893,17309,329,"Both of Earth Wind & Fire greatest hits albums on one collection.  And some excellent hits, to boot.

The good:  You are getting mostly album versions here.  And they are excellent hits.  Fantasy, After The Love Is Gone, September, Shining Star, Can't Hide Love, That's the Way of the World, Singasong--the list goes on.  Mostly the big hits from the mid 1970s are here, with the inclusion of Let's Groove (a hit in late 1981 and a good one at that).  Missing are the out-takes and filler material.  You get this album, you will wonder how the radio even survives today with Autotunes ruining today's music (you won't find that here).

There are a few time issues, though.  Boogie Wonderland is a bit short running--somewhere out there, I have had a single version running 4:59 and really running the full 4:59.  This runs 4:48.  September is also a bit short, running only 3:34 instead of the 3:37 I have had on the boxed set and vinyl records.  You will not be getting the big R&B only hits from the mid 1980s here, nor will you get the early hits before 1975.  ""Devotion"", found on the boxed set, came out late 1974 and is not here.  Perhaps just as well, since there is only so much space on a single disc and including all the outtakes, R&B only hits from beyond 1981, and the early material would result in a multi-disc set that would cost three times as much.

The album is an excellent value.  The only bad thing I can say that is not a compromise on what will fit is that Boogie Wonderland is only 4:48 when I have heard a 4:59 single version.  I do not expect the 12"" single version that runs 8:25, but I would have liked the label to preserve the regular single version.  Other than that, you will not regret buying the collection.",1483920000,5

And this Elton John cover song you can really tell He sings it with meaning again coming from His Soul, The song has always been one of my favorite songs written of course by Bernie Taupin and recorder by Elton John, But George Michael's version recorded live with Elton John just brings it up to another level, Not going to say one version is better than the other!...As its just a great song from either artist with true meanings in the lyrics!

Just wish George Michael recorded a non-live studio recorded version of this song without Elton!...But with no disrespect to Elton in anyway saying that!

But anyway God Speed George Michael...Another truly gifted musical artist that sadly passed away to early in life along with so many other truly gifted musical artists like Bowie, Prince and so many others in the year 2016!.....The year the Music really died!",1484006400,5

101099,17282,15465,"Saw Ted/Trucks band on ACL and liked them so WishListed ""Let Me Get By"".

First the music...

While generally classified as Blues-Rock or Blues, I hear a country-rock flavor in many tracks. Not surprising given Trucks' Allman Brothers roots, but I hear more of it in Susan's voice on some tracks. Best example is track 1, ""Anyhow"". While I'm not a ""country fan"", I'm not adverse to a little country flavor... just not into a steady diet of it. And Flavor is all that is here... and only on some tracks adding to the variety and there is nothing if not variety in this 2 disc set.

Other tracks are pure blues including some where Susan's voice is reminiscent of Bonnie Raitt. Track 2, ""Laugh About It"", is an early example. I love Bonnie, but if I heard her in every vocal, then I'd be critical. I didn't, so I'm not.

And then there are tracks that come out of nowhere... juke joint material... rock... just wonderfully varied listening.

Now onto the SQ (Sound Quality). When I saw TTB on ACL there must have been eight or ten players on stage. Guitars, horns, keyboards, string, drums x 2 and backing vocalists. And they all seem to be there on this CD, but when they all play I have issues telling and that's the rub. On the three or four busiest tracks the supporting cast all seem to fall into a mush of sound even sometimes dragging the backup vocals with them. Susan's vocals always rise above as does Derek's guitar work, but there's mired sound below them.

Simpler tracks, like the stripped down ""Swamp Raga..."", are beautifully done, as are those where backing instruments tend to take turns, making the confusion of the bogged down tracks all the more mysterious. Not a reason to avoid purchase of this issue, but potentially a reason to skip a track here and there depending on my mood.",1484092800,4

She has a knack for writing in that 1960's garage style, and her voice is just perfect for it.  As a songwriter, I don't think she can write a bad song - she's so consistant it's scary.  Love this album!",1484092800,5

101273,10595,10472,"I'm always searching for stuff with the funk. Serious chops and space between them, so I end up looking at some disco bands naturally. This album is everything people hate about disco. It is also what everybody loved in it as well. Highly produced with airy string parts, female vocals with nothing to say but the stupidest of repetitive phrases. I mean it's terrible really but still retaining solid funk in the rhythm sections making it cool enough to add just enough of the cliche. I honestly cannot wait to hear some of their other albums. If there was more to be said for the vocals and lyrics I'd give it a 5.",1484179200,4

Take On me by Aha, Everybody Wants to Rule the World by Tears for fears(done incredibly well!), Rock With You by Michael Jackson(another really good one!), Jump by Van Halen, Wish You Were Here by Pink Floyd, and an incredibly good, and I mean Top 10 level of good vocal performance of The Last Unicorn. Other songs included are originally by Rush and others but all are performed by Ninja Sex Party. DO NOT let the name of this band fool you or their YouTube ""Game Grumps"" channel(shameless advertisement of their channel WITHOUT PAY on my part and done VOLUNTARILY) which is mainly comedy and video games. THIS BAND DESERVES AIRTIME. Especially Everybody Wants To Rule the World, Rock With You, and The Last Unicorn. Those three songs on this album sell this thing alone! I know I might be rambling a little bit on The Last Unicorn which may sound a bit strange to some people but you have GOT to hear this ""ballad"" to believe it! Lead vocalists everywhere beware!

101478,13054,8565,"The selection of symphonies is good, but the performances vary. The best is Mozart Jupiter, as good as any I know. The Dvorak New World and Haydn is pretty good but much of the rest is pedestrian. Boulton and Mackarras are always uninspiring. So 3stars but still very worthwhile",1484352000,3
101479,396,19929,"Another live set that hasn't been reviewed lately so I thought I'd give it it's due.

If you don't already own this gig in another configuration, this is worth adding to your Dead shelf of live music.  This is a broadcast from the Harding Theater in 1971 over KSFX-FM and is  about 3 1/2 hours long.  There's very little DJ chatter but there's band tune-ups between songs.  But for me that only adds authenticity to the listening experience.  The sound overall is decent/good--crisp, fairly clean and open sounding.  But like similar broadcasts there's  a few sonic issues--the worst being the dropouts during ""Brown Eyed Woman"".  But overall this is a nice sounding set.  Lesh's bass is mixed well, the drums don't overpower anything but have a solid sound, and Garcia's guitar is out front (along with everyone's  vocals) where it should be.  To my ears this is one of the better releases of it's kind.

The discs snap  inside a double jewel case with two b&w photos in the trays--one on stage and the other is Garcia with poster artist Victor Moscoso and others.  The two  page booklet has a short essay on the gig and a b&w photo of the Harding Theater.  The cover photo with Pigpen is from another venue.  The case slips inside a thin cardboard box with the same graphics.

This is the concert-warts and all--including the band losing power and wondering what to do.  Some fans may object to the tune-ups/noodling between songs, so to each his own on that subject.  As I said, for me it  adds authenticity.  Back then you pretty much expected some kind of sound problems and just went along with it knowing that it would soon be fixed.  The songs are a mix of older and more recent tunes, from songs they played early on like ""Beat It On Down The Line"",  to more recent things like ""Mexicali Blues"".  There's a nice ""Dark Star"" and a great ""The Other One>Me And My Uncle>The Other One"" among other fine performances.  The addition of Keith Godchaux seemed to energize the band during this period and they played some great gigs in '71.

Even with the sonic problems which are relatively few, this is well worth adding to your shelf of live Dead.  This era was definitely one of the best periods for live gigs and this concert is another good example.  I was lucky enough to attend college in Palo Alto (south of S.F.) in the late '60s/early '70s and heard/experienced the Dead  both outdoors for free and in various venues in the area, and this set is another good reminder of just how good this band was.  A nice way to spend 3 1/2 hours.

And check out the '77 Cornell show that Deadheads have long wished for in remastered sound, available in May.  There's an 11 disc set also available that includes Cornell.  The Harding show is also available in a 21 CD set titled ""71 Dead"".",1484352000,4

101620,396,14743,"I know this has already been reviewed but I've been a Stoneground fan since somewhere in the early '70s, so I just have to say a few words about the band and this album.

Finally!  A label has reissued this great album with that live S.F. vibe to it.  I still own the original vinyl from those days and this (we called them gate-fold albums back then)  was a beautifully packed double album set with nicely done photos in the inside.  But beyond the visuals it's the music the band played that set them apart from other bands of the period.  Easily shifting from rock to blues, gospel to soul,  folk to country, and a combination of any of those genres, this band had that certain ""thing"", that vibe that marked it as a band to hear.  But sadly Stoneground never really received the notoriety they deserved.  But they did leave us with three albums from that era--this is the second (and arguably) best of the three.

With three live sides (from a KSAN-FM broadcast in '71) and one studio side, this (originally double vinyl)  album really let people know what the band was all about.  I only heard Stoneground once somewhere in the early '70s on a bill when they were a support act.  But their use of multiple vocalists combined with good (but never showy)  instrumentalists and a set list of tunes from  Johnny Cash to Mississippi John Hurt to Vanda and Young (of Easybeats fame and Young's family members later in AC/DC), to Dylan to Hank Williams, plus their own originals gave this band a real wide-ranging  identity, especially on stage.

This album will give you a good idea of what the band was like on stage.  It almost makes me want to put on one of my old tie-die shirts and relive the memories.  If you were lucky enough to have heard the band during their short life you know what I mean.  But if you're new to Stoneground this 2 CD set will give you some idea of both the band and that era of great S.F. bands.

Until now the only readily available album of their live music is ""The Last Dance Live January 6, 1973"", a single disc recorded in Sacramento, Ca.  After that the band went their separate ways due to the rigors of constant touring and little to show for it.  But they did leave us with some good albums from that era--this one being the best example of what they could do on stage.  What a time that was back then.  This reissue is like getting a present from old friends.",1484611200,4

101624,7245,11342,"This was the original cover put forward, not by Jimi (it is often stated he hated it), but by the UK label boss (Chris Stamp) who liked to push boundaries in order to get attention. Hence it was only released in the UK like this and was banned from many stores. This mini LP replica is mainly for collectors. It should also be noted that the artwork requested by Jimi himself was also rejected and now we have the famous red and yellow art photo.

I never purchased a JH Experience studio album until after his death. My only Hendrix album during his lifetime was Smash Hits which did me just fine but left me wanting more, later, after his death. ARE YOU EXPERIENCED was an amazing stoner find which I discovered only after entry into college and joining the club. Yeah, that was groovy. I gave AXIS BOLD AS LOVE a listen or two but it didn't do the thing for me. It was missing something essential. I nailed it down, what it was missing only after I heard ELECTRIC LADYLAND. THAT was what it was missing! Now ELECTRIC LADYLAND was the culmination of everything great about Jimi. Here is his masterpiece! I used to play side three (the psychedelic side) over and over and skipped side two much too often, and side four was MY favorite side so the second vinyl disc just plumb wore out! Then I sat without ANY Hendrix for a couple decades 'cept for a reissue CD of Smash Hits (again). So about 6 months ago I ran across this remastered work of art in a hold-over hippie record store, shoo'd the moths out of my wallet and have been happily eating ELECTRIC LADYLAND once again for a while now.

Now, if you are one like me, pop into the way-back machine and figure out if you grooved to melodious Beatles, Mamas & Papas, Simon & Garfunkel; or you liked to trip out with The Doors, The Airplane, The Dead; if you were adverse to screaming wailing guitar noise (as you used to think of it) but you could knock down a platter of Led Zeppelin or The Who, well maybe initially Hendrix just wasn't your bag, but you could easily dig Red House, All Along The Watchtower, Foxy Lady; yeah you were a Smash Hits kinda fan. Now you are all growed up and you are in need of a little HISTORY. So what's the Real Deal behind the mystique? Everyone says this is The Album, the Masterpiece, the Hendrix Sgt Pepper, even Rolling Stone mag bows down before it. Huh? Well, let's look-see...

Bear in mind that Bob Dylan and Frank Zappa threw pop convention out the window three years earlier and released the first ever double LPs from the pop-rock community; the double LP had basically been the providence of jazz performers like Ella who released a number of them; then Donovan released A Gift From A Flower To A Garden in a fashionable box with trinkets in '67; and Cream's Wheels Of Fire in '68. Chicago would make the trend a habit beginning in '69 and progressive rock acts would make it almost a requirement after that. My purchase of the album was after it had become fashionable, but in October of '68, Jimi had joined an elite handful of artists with great expectations. Now that fabulous double dinner treat fits on one CD but it's a full CD with a smorgasbord of sound!

Jimi likes to ask his listeners pertinent questions before he kicks off the set. In '67 it was Are You Experienced? 15 months later: Have You Ever Been To Electric Lady Land? Both albums answered the questions with amazing results, but LADYLAND simply entreats the audience to a diversity of compositional talent which is unprecedented (at least at that time): psychedelic sounds and experimental guitar works, pop, rock, and R&B confections, jazz licks and blues jams; LADYLAND is like a premiere at an art gallery. It chomps off huge chunks of varietal genre, fuses them together or lays them down against each other in odd meter and arrangement, the end result is one of the most satisfying demonstrations of crossover musicianship you will ever encounter. And when you listen to tunes like his cover of Earl King's Come On you will understand, you will perceive where the likes of Stevie Ray Vaughan and Joe Bonamassa arose from. Little Miss Strange seems almost out of place as a 60's pop-rock candy tune with Noel Redding on the mike, but pay attention to guitar layers, the wah-wah, fuzz, fills, and solos, anything but bubblegum folks! The live Voodoo Chile and its' Slight Return variant are sheer monuments in music history, and the psychedelic stretch from Rainy Day to Still Raining is one of the best guitar god runs ever laid down on tape. Let's not forget that All Along The Watchtower teams the ""voice of our generation"" with one of the greatest guitar-god icons ever, into a smoldering track that featured revolutionary guitar and bass work all laid down by Jimi himself, a song that has become a soundtrack piece defining an era and one of the greatest recordings of all time.

Young dude's: if you are wondering ""what Jimi Hendrix album should I buy?"" Can't recommend this one enough. Yes, I know, Are You Experienced is an attractive issue, being the debut and containing huge amounts of popular Hendrix trax, and it is definitely an item you should own (be sure to pick up the re-issue containing Red House which was only available on the UK release for years, Red House is one of Hendrix' best recordings as well)... but... ELECTRIC LADYLAND is Jimi's definitive masterpiece, his magnum opus, the pure art gallery of all his talent distilled into one creative Everest.",1484611200,5

101726,6611,19941,"SUPERSTARS OF THE 70'S-VARIOUS ATRISTS: One of the truly definitive box sets of its era, this four album collection scoops up the best in rock, pop and soul that Warner/Atlantic/Elektra had to offer at the start of the ""me decade"" (some late sixties gems are included as well). The draw here is the engaging mix of heat sinker hits like School's Out, Dock of the Bay, Lola, In the Midnight Hour and If You Could Read My Mind with choice deep tracks including The Byrds' earthy take on Neil Young's Cowgirl in the Sand, Randy Newman's sardonic Sail Away and The Doors' post Jim Morrison effort Tightrope Ride. Unlike K-Tel's infamous format of cramming twenty or more edited songs onto just two halves of an LP, Superstars of the 70's spreads forty-nine memories across eight sides. Aretha, Hendrix, the Doobies, Judy Collins, the Dead, Led Zep, Seals & Crofts, Yes and many more are on board to make this the equivalent of the perfect AM/FM playlist from the soundtrack of your formative years.

101744,1108,1243,"I'm a fan of Daft Punk, but I have to admit that the first few times I heard their collaboration with Pharrell Williams, ""Get Lucky,"" I wasn't impressed.  It didn't have the same kind of electronic charm as Daft Punk's usual work, far more pop-based and with Willams overtaking their signature robotic vocals.  Much like another reviewer of this song, however, the more I listened to it, the more hooked I became.  It's a catchy song, upbeat and almost impossible not to dance along to.  I would have liked a bit more of Daft Punk's presence in this song than Williams', but that's just my personal preference.

Also, this song is VERY repetitive, and so it might drive some listeners nuts.  It doesn't bother me too much, however.  And while it might not be my favorite song by the band (I still enjoy ""Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger"" and ""One More Time"" more), it's still a good listen, a nice fusion of pop and electronica.",1484697600,4

The song was actually released in Australia in 1981, but it took a year before this Melbourne based band hit the charts in the US and Canada. Their style is unique. A lot of their material has elements of Reggae in it. The singer Colin Hay has a remarkable way to present a song to the audience. This is one of their songs that stuck with me to this date. It is one of the tracks found on their debut album 'Business As Usual'. The MP3 sound is ok.",1484784000,5

101823,11864,17789,"I will listen to this again and again because it's amazing. Great vocals. Great instruments So fresh yet so familiar. Above all, it's varied. The range of genre is amazing and not definable. They do not sound the same in every cut, not even close, not in any way.

I don't listen to new music. I listen to artist I'm familiar with,but from every genre and time frame. This was the first on the list of newly added so I decided to listen. They almost lost me on the first few seconds, immediately thought ""another hard rock album"" But then the tempo began to slide and it kept my interest, then a searing electric lead, blues undertones pulled me in completely. Then the vocals, sweet rock and roll! I was hooked.

Tore myself away from ""No Good"" and was immediately blown away by ""Way Down We Go"". The closeness of the vocals, the places the whole thing goes... ""Broken Bones"" freaked me out! I grew up way down south in Carolina in the church; started out like the oldest gospel song or a chain gang chant. And on it goes to Glass House, night- out-at-the-bar rock and roll at it's best. Classic!

Starting writing this review a few songs in! I'm still listening!",1484784000,5

101841,17129,12601,When I first got this album I had heard HeavyDirtySoul on Madden and really liked it.  I bought this after listening to a couple of tracks and it really is an amazing album.  I listen to lots of different music but something about this album really grabbed me.  After awhile Ride and Stressed Out both blew up and I started hearing them everywhere so apparently it was pleasing to the masses too.  Well worth the money!

Grand Funk was highly acclaimed by audiences nationwide, but they never got much radio play and were frequently panned by critics. I had a chance to see them live. I was mesmerized by their powerful stage presence. They kicked some butt. They did sell an awful lot of records. I bought a couple of their vinyl albums after I had seen them live. I give this only a 4 Star rating because I think the re-master version is a bit messed up. Re-mastering is not always a good thing, you see.",1484784000,4

I'm on board with that. This album is indeed a great one. Like the best rock albums it's powerful, gripping, moving, thought-provoking, and inspiring. And every time ""What It Means"" comes on, I jump around the room and pump my fist in the air. These guys are on fire!

Hood and Cooley have written some outstanding new material for this album. Listen to Patterson Hood as he sings, the heartfelt words cutting through the musical mix like sharp knives. You can't NOT be moved by these songs. The lyrics cover plenty of political territory, particularly America's continuing battles with racism.

What an Amazing Sounding ""Live"" Recording, The Eagles Are In Flight
Not Only an Amazing Recording, But an Amazing Band.
These Guys were The Voice of a Generation ...
They were Like a Perfect Movie Cast. ""wow "" They Could Harmonize Their Vocals
And Harmonize Those Acoustic Guitars  ...
Not Bad considering They Started Out as a Back Up Band for Linda Ronstadt.
Glenn Frey And Don Henley were in The Right Place At The Right Time
And The Eagles have been In Flight Ever Since ...
It's Not Just Glenn And Don ... But, The Whole Band Is Amazing.
It's Sad to say Glenn Frey is Flying in different Air space these days ...
But, Your Memory And Music Will Live On Forever ...

Ok, I've seen the ABB over 50 times from 1986 to 2014, been to the Beacon, Spectrum,Peach Festival 3 times etc,etc- I have over 150 live shows in my collection- and I have to say this April 7th 1972 Syracuse show is going to be right at the top!!!! Always nice to have another show with 5 piece line-up and this one is outstanding! Might be best show I ever heard of Berry Oakley. Everybody is on though, don't you just love how Dickey builds a lead slowly??? I mean the last version of the group was excellent with Warren & Derek but Dickey wrote most of these songs- he is the man here. Now for the price of this cd you get the famous  A&R studios broadcast with Duane and the MSG
show from 1986 with Stephen Stills, Carlos Santana Paul Butterfield, Buddy Miles, Felix Cavaliere and even Chuck Leavell from the Brothers & Sisters era ABB!.Actually this is the first year I saw the ""ABB"" at Fairmont Park in Philly- it was Greg Allman Band & then Great Southern and then they played together.

101979,16539,16510,"Okay, so I must say, I like this album, but it has too many flaws to overlook.
With each review for anything, I use different styles for how product needs to be told, so for this product, This Is What The Truth Feels Like, by Gwen Stefani, I will use the What I didn't like and What I did like.
Okay, let's get started.

WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE

* Some of the songs, I feel ended too early. And this happened a lot, which kind of sucked, the ending could've been drug out for ten more seconds at least in a few songs. I don't know if this is just me? But it bothered my enjoyment for a big quantity of the album.
* Some of the lyrics became repetitive. Sometimes, it almost just felt like a written song, without something for me to get sucked into, because I couldn't ignore the repetition. This was for, from what I can remember, a little majority of the album, but still.
* The last song, Rare, was what I really liked out of thee entire thing. Before I listened to this entire album in order, as I usually do with all albums, I had already liked Misery and Where Would I Be?, You're my Favorite was good too. But otherwise, while listening to this album, those songs I liked in the past, specifically Misery and Where Would I Be?, just missed me, and the only one that really stuck out was Rare. The song Rare wasn't perfect, but it was better than most of the songs on the album.
* Also, some of the lyrics, just came off cheesy and silly at times. It has Gwen Stefani's signature flare (which I love, as I have been listened to Gwen Stefani ever since she went solo in the 2000's), but I don't know if it worked with all of the subject matter Gwen was trying to convey. I was divided, while Gwen tried to be serious, and make us feel what she was feeling, I still couldn't shake the theatrical feeling that came along with it. I just don't think the theatrical tone, that I think was supposed to back Stefani's anger for her husband's cheating, worked. It just felt like Gwen's older albums, which isn't a bad thing, but yet again, just (in my opinion) didn't fit the atmosphere of the album overall.
* At a certain part of the album, when she said that her husband had left, I felt that that was a little bit too rushed. It was like she was angry one moment, and then sad the other. I don't know how cheating feels, and I am sure that there are a lot of ups and downs, but this was just a little problem for me.
Overall, for the negative side of this album, the lyrics felt repetitive, and I felt the album could've had a lot of potential.
I am not trying to be mean. This album was very special to Gwen, but still, it felt repetitive and it felt like it could've been a lot better.
Now, for the good side of the album.

WHAT I LIKED

* Her semi-rapping (it was still good though) with Fetty Wap, whom I like out of a lot of rappers I just don't care for. Asking 4 It was a good song, and I enjoyed it.
* Her song Naughty. It had just the right theatrics, and it went along with this great, Empire-esque, beat. At least that's what it made me think of. There's this rap feeling that hovers over the album, much more heavily than Gwen Stefani's other works, and I can't say that it's a bad thing. I liked this song, because it wasn't something I was expecting. It even had this feeling of Soul to it. I don't know if ""feeling"" is the right word, I just can't think of another one.
* Misery, You're My Favorite, Where Would I Be?, Make Me Like You, Rare.

So, overall, the album could've been better. But it does have a good few tunes. I still love Gwen Stefani's music, but I am not screaming at the top of my lungs for her next album. 3 stars overall.",1484956800,3
101980,2916,611,"For me, the best Katy Perry song. I have heard it on the radio a thousand times, but I'm still not bored by it. The bass beat is that good, and the rap by Juicy J takes the song to another level.",1484956800,5

101987,2916,17965,"The beat is cool, fun, easy to dance to, fast but chill at the same time.

The lyrics are basically the same four lines repeated. That is Marshmello's style. He isn't big on words, at least right now. He is new on the scene. As he evolves as an artist, maybe he will learn to write more complex songs.

The beat saves this song",1484956800,4

102002,17420,19175,"Comparing ""Live at the Academy"" box set (more in depth/lengthy reissue of the 1971 ""Rock of Ages"") with this ""Last Waltz"" really shows how completely superior the 1971 shows are. Even though ""The Last Waltz"" gets ton of publicity for all of its pomp; Scocesy Direction and Star Studded guest list, ""Live at the Academy"" shows the band still hungry and fresh, full of energy and inspiration. Even though, they were already going into dark places with 3 of the members trying out ""White China"" heroin and already Richard Manuel's drinking taking on new levels of seriousness, they still got it together for these shows and were able to put out a couple of really good releases.",1484956800,3
102003,3599,18163,"More pop than punk. The guys are so talented that I think a bad album is literally impossible. However, this album just comes across as a money grab and play for radio time. Like another reviewer has said, every single song is geared as a single. That can get kind of tedious. Not every song is supposed to be a single, you need some breaks and transitions. Not much of a hard edge to this album at all, some songs are downright sugary. Don't get me wrong, enjoyable enough, but maybe a little too teenie-bopper. I kind of figured at this point in their career they would be transitioning into something more mature or darker, not something, well, more shallow.",1484956800,3

102007,2916,17972,"A song made to promote Euro 2016, and it sounds like it. It is good, but it is a marketing tool. The beat is for clapping more than dancing. The lyrics are simple and uplifting--""we're in this together"". There is nothing special about it, but it is enjoyable.

I love soccer, or real Football I should say, and David Guetta is great, but this isn't his best work. I'm still glad I bought it though. It is a good song.",1484956800,4

102034,2674,18285,"This album is one of my favorite recent discoveries. I never heard Karl Blau before, but then I started reading about him and this album in various magazines and online, and then heard his version of Tom T. Hall's ""That's How I Got To Memphis"" and was instantly smitten by his warm, melodic voice. One of those voices that commands your immediate attention. I promptly ordered this album from Amazon and am now even more enamored. This is fabulous music!

First thing to know; there is no original material on this album. It's comprised entirely of cover versions, most of them classic country or folk tunes like ""That's How I Got to Memphis"", ""Homecoming"" (another fine Tom T. Hall song), Townes Van Zandt's ""If I Needed You"", Tom Rush's ""No Regrets"", and two songs that Waylon Jenniings will know and love, ""Six White Horses"" and ""Dreaming My Dreams."" Throw in a cover of the Bee Gees' ""To Love Somebody"", Gary Paxton's ""Woman (Sensuous Woman)"", and a few more tunes and you a nearly perfect album.

Song after song, I keep thinking; this is wonderful! It's a seamless blend of truly timeless songs, all of them punctuated by Blau's emotionally powerful voice. The liner notes by Tucker Martine call Blau a ""powerful interpreter of songs"" and that's an understatement. Blau obviously took great care in picking just the right songs to cover, but it's also fair to say this his versions of some, if not most, of these song are the best ones ever recorded. Really, this guy is that good! Even if you are hesitant to buy something categorized as ""country"" give this album a chance. Simply one of the best albums I've heard in the past year.",1485043200,5

102187,82,3493,"HATE THE CHANGE AMAZON MADE RE MUSIC.
I have always loved being able to listen to small pieces of a track and and how when listening to a certain category of music other suggestions were offered. In that way I was able to discover new genres of music and new artists I would not have known about. Already earlier Amazon made some changes I did not like either. For example, one used to be able to scroll down quickly while reading or playing a game to check what track was exactly playing. Why on earth would they change that. I do not want to pay a monthly fee and feel I may now have to look elsewhere for finding interesting music. Not only that, some of Amazon's streaming music had glitches, sort of hiccups. How am I to know now whether the CD is o.k. or not.",1485129600,5

When are these contemporary artists going to stop writing music that might as well have come from the '50s and '60s?  Rock is DEAD, vocals and lyrics are DEAD, the guitar as the featured instrument is DONE.  Rock song structure is so boring because we've had to listen to it our whole lives.  People need to wake up and find that there's a whole nation of artists out there making great music that's called ""post rock,"" without vocals and lyrics, without a dominating guitar, without that awful, repetitive rock song structure.  We are in the post-Christian, postmodern era;  WAKE UP PEOPLE!",1485216000,1

102359,6236,11278,"Years ago, when I was listening to K-LOVE a lot I heard Kari Jobe and immediately loved her music. At the time, the song ""Steady My Heart"" from her album ""Where I Find You"" was the newest single and I couldn't stop listening to it! I was going through some tough times and that song always helped soothe me. The last few years I've been busy raising my twins so I haven't consistently listened to music and only recently have I started listening to more music. I love to sing and listening to music that I both love and that's easy to sing along with is perfect for me because I always feel more relaxed, uplifted and happier afterwards. For the last several weeks, I've been listening to Kari Jobe's music nonstop because she is one of my favorite Christian artists and her music is beautiful. I'm very grateful to Amazon Prime for allowing me to listen to this album!

""Kari Jobe"" is Jobe's debut album and it is absolutely wonderful! There are 12 songs and the album lasts about 54 minutes in length. The product description states this album is considered Christian Contemporary and I agree with that because all of the songs are filled with praising God with a contemporary feel, using many musical instruments. Every song is so full of meaning and I can't help but sing along. I enjoy every song but would say my favorites are ""Healer"" (I could listen to this song over and over!), ""Beautiful,"" ""Singing Over Me,"" ""Sweep Me Away,"" and ""Revelation Song,"" the latter of which has been sung by many artists.

I LOVE this album, along with the album ""Where I Find You"" and I am eager for her newest album ""The Garden"" to come out soon! I've been listening to her music for several hours a day and it fills me with such joy and peacefulness. I love listening to her beautiful voice and find myself singing along with her at times. The other reason I love her music so much, and most Christian music, is that it's safe for my four-year-old twins to listen to and I don't have to worry about them hearing anything they shouldn't. If you enjoy any of Kari Jobe's music, I highly recommend this album!",1485302400,5

102363,18,18259,"Margaret Glaspy is a New York-based guitarist-singer-songwriter. She released a couple of promising EPs several years ago, and finally released this, her full-length debut album in 2016. If you are not familiar with Glaspy's sound, think early-Liz Phair, although Glaspy's influences are far and wide (from Joni Mitchell to Weezer).

""Emotions and Math"" (12 tracks; 34 min.) opens with the title track, and the song sets the tone for the entire album: rough-around-the-edges lead guitar from Glaspy, accompanied by drums and bass, and that's it. But don't call it a minimalist sound. Glaspy's warm vocals shine in this song, and indeed the entire album. In ""Situation"", Glaspy croons ""Take your hands off of me/There's nothing wrong with me/I don't like sympathy/Don't you dare pity me"", wow. ""You and I"" (1st single) is about as catchy as anything on here, and of course sporting smart lyrics (""I'm not looking for an open door to talk about love/Maybe you agree but I see you saving pictures of/You and I/I don't want to see you crying but it looks like a matter of time"", ha!). ""Somebody to Anybody"" is the first of a couple of songs where it's just Glaspy and her guitar. ""Memory Street"" is outright bluesy. Side B opens with a rollicking ""Pins and Needles"". ""Parental Guidance"" is a biting look back at early school years (""Make friends with kiddies you can't relate to/And play it cool in the school yard so that nobody hates you""). ""Love Like This"" is my absolute favorite track on here, with Glaspy's hard guitar licks while singing (with vented anger) ""People lie, cheat, kill for love like this/Few have known, seen, felt a love like this"". The album closes with ""Black is Blue"", another standout song. All of the songs are in the 2 to 3 min. range and this album clips by in no time. My daughter, who knows my music taste quite well, got this CD for me last month as a Christmas gift, and I have been playing this relentlessly.

By pure chance, Margaret Claspy is coming to Cincinnati next week (opening for the Lumineers) and I cannot wait to hear how these songs will resonate in a live setting (in a 15,000 seat arena no less). Meanwhile, if you are in the mood for indie music with a biting undercurrent, please give this album a try. I am quite certain you will enjoy it quite a bit. ""Emotions and Math"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

*UPDATE* I saw her in concert, and she and her band (drummer and bassist) put on a great 30 min. set, opening with ""Love Like This"" (as mentioned, my favorite track of the album), and closing with the title track. In between she obviously played mostly from the album, but she also brought a new track (she didn't mention the title) that was perhaps the best of the whole set, with a great guitar solo going straight into a long instrumental outro, wow. Can't wait to see where Glasky is going next. Meanwhile, if you have a chance to see her live, do not miss her!",1485302400,4

102414,2705,18783,"Had I known 'Beulah', the first release from John Paul White since the demise of the Civil Wars, had come out last August, I'm 99% sure it would have been my top pick of 2016. As it is, now it stands as a contender for best of 2017.

My lord - what a great disk!!!

Ok - you know I find fault with most anything to a degree, but there isn't much to pick on with 'Beulah'.

White starts strong with ""Black Leaf"" which I just loved from the start,  then he moves into ""What's So.  The song starts of very Muscle Shoals-y, which could go either way depending on if you like that style, but I'd say a third of the way into the song, I was hooked. It is by far the best song on the disk....and that's saying something on a disk like this.

Maybe that's the thing with this album too.  On ""the Once and Future Queen"", it starts ok, and I was afraid it would be a milquetoast song....but as it goes along, it's incredible. The structure changes and the 'verse' and 'chorus' are almost non-existent. There is no confined element so many songs / artists seem to stick to with some kind of formula.  ...and some of White's vocal phrasing just kind of keeps you guessing.

Ditto with ""Hope I Die"". It starts off in one direction, one I wasn't sure I'd like, but it changes gears too....and then back again. The start of the song is not necessarily my style, but as I was learning, it was important to not make quick judgments with JWP's songs. He figured out to keep me on the hook.

With an artist like White, who is known for the Civil Wars, I was afraid people would look at this disk as the 'what if' one....and how it might compare to a Civil Wars disk. I tried to go in differently, and I think that helped. Save for ""Make You Cry"" and ""Hate the Way You Love Me"", nothing fits his previous band's mold. And while I really like both songs, at first, all I could hear is how it would have been with Joy Williams' harmony, and I didn't get that (or want that) from the rest of the disk.

'Beulah' is a steal at any price, but c'mon.......put a crowbar in the wallet and get it. I don't think you'll regret it.",1485388800,5

And as for the soundtrack album it is fantastic. I rate it one of Willie Nelson's best albums if not his best. What I like best about the album was it is all live music and Willie is one of those performers who always sounds better in person then on a recording. Of all the songs from this soundtrack the best of them all as far as I am concerned is ""Angel Flying Too Close To The Ground"". A sentimentally sad melancholic song with touching lyrics to it Willie is at his best while singing it. Willie has had a slew of hit songs during his career. And many are probably more well known then this song but for me this is his all time best performance. Give this a listen and see for yourself.",1485388800,5

102520,16167,8704,"The British band 'Free', formed in 1968, was known mostly for their stunning live concerts and their constant touring. Earlier studio records did not sell very well. This changed in 1970 with the release of the album 'Fire And Water'. One of the tracks was this song. It turned out to be a huge hit for this band. I was captivated by the rhythmic character of this tune. It grabs you. Paul Rodgers was part of this band's line-up. He later fronted the band 'Bad Company'.

102524,16167,4106,"This song was released in 1984. It was part of the album 'Heartbeat City'. I have never really been a fan of 'The Cars'. The song was written by frontman Ric Ocasek but, for a change, not sung by him. Instead, Benjamin Orr, the bassist, took on the vocal part of the track. Also, the musical style differed from typical Ocasek new wave.  It turned out to be their biggest international hit. I liked the song a lot, but I never bought the album. Now I have the song on my play lists and I am glad about that. The MP3 sound quality is better than what I had expected.",1485475200,5

102560,16167,8696,"'Scorpions' are a Hard Rock and Heavy Metal band formed in Hanover, Germany in 1965. The period from 1978 until 1992 was by far their most successful time. This song was part of their 11th studio album released in 1991. It speaks about the changes in politics after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the demise of the USSR regime. The singer Klaus Meine, member of the original line-up, did an outstanding job presenting this power ballad. The song achieved major recognition world wide. It was one of the best selling singles of all times. It was the best selling single performed by a German artist. It peaked at #4 on the US chart in August of 1991. It was not the only power ballad performed by the Scorpions. This song and their other ballads are on the list of my all-time favorites. It is a must have. It is the greatest Heavy Metal Ballad. The MP3 sound quality is quite all right.",1485475200,5
102561,16167,4770,This song was on the album 'Rebel Yell' released in 1983. It is done in a slower pace and more ballad like than most of Billy Idol's material. It shows a much softer side of him even though the lyrics reflect some anger and disgust like a lot of his more staunch and powerful songs. When I first heard it I had to confirm that this was in fact Billy singing. I liked it right away. It stuck with me to this day. It is a 1999 remaster. It sounds ok. There is not that much difference between it and the original '83 recording. It depends on what kind of sound system you are using. It does have more dynamic range than the old vinyl.,1485475200,5

This song, released the same year, won some awards and a US Grammy nomination as far as I recall. I like the style and the musical flow of this tune. Yes, one can hear elements stemming from the 'Genesis' style, but different enough to make it unique. I always liked this song a lot. I still do.

102668,17482,16312,"This is really a lovely song and I was shocked when I found out I did not have this track on any of my Beatles albums. It is rare because there was already a song titled P.S. I Love You with lyrics by Johnny Mercer, written in 1934. Because of this, McCartney's song was a B-side and then EMI lost the master tapes. I'm glad to have it in my collection and I'll play it with Billie Holiday's very different rendition of P.S. I Love You",1485648000,5

102695,1209,1303,"This is the first LP record (album) from the Pretty Reckless and was released in 2011. ""The Pretty Reckless"" are a New York rock band fronted by Taylor Momsen.
The Pretty Reckless now have 3 albums and I listened to the 2nd one first. I don't recall hearing any singles form ""Light Me Up"" but who doesn't remember ""Follow Me Down"" and :Heaven Knows"".
As a 1st album this is really pretty good. Musically this isn't very experimental or pregressive. It's a standard rock set. What makes this special then is Taylor Momsen's voice and the lyrics. The lyrics tell a dark tale of drugs, alcohol, sex and sexual abuse. So even though the music is modern-rock conservative it will build an audience. So as the audience builder album it works well and act as a gateway to the more populist ""Going to Hell"". The two best songs are ""The Walls are closing in/hangman"" and ""Mad love"". Two great bookends for an interesting debut album>",1485648000,5
102696,13440,85,"I first heard this bombastic song in the early 1970's while on an extended work related stay in Australia.

102712,15010,12964,"Great songs, great performances ,but terrible sound.  What we have here is an epidemic in the music world, cavernous reverb, highly compressed dynamics, and a droning grunginess throughout.  It type of sound plagues the industry and obscures any subtlety and nuance.  It seems that pop records are engineered by former video game sound engineers.  I long for the rich and round fidelity of decades past.  I guess if you are listening on ear buds on your iPod or smart phone while riding the subway, you might not notice.  Try listening on a fine audiophile home stereo and you'll understand what I am talking about.  Her live appearances on TV do not suffer from this. I assume neither does her concerts.",1485648000,3

However, the track sounds just like Casting Crowns, except without the background vocals. It's a challenging piece to perform, timing is tricky. I basically had to listen to Casting Crowns a 100 times to memorize their timing and syncopation. Powerful message and it was well received by our congregation.",1485734400,3

My day is better, my anxiety lower, I am calmer and happier and more focused on the days I listen to one of his sessions, usually when I am laying down.  I recommend him to everyone I know because his message is perfect, his voice and technique are perfect. Finding him has literally taken me from the edge of a nervous breakdown to a state of healing and peacefulness within a few weeks. PS I am copy pasting this same review to all of the sessions I have tried. I really am a user of his sessions and I truly have come around to a much better state of daily functioning because of them.",1485820800,5

I bought this around the same time as I bought the Dirty Heads album and this one is more true to Pepper's roots than the DH album.  They've still got it and it shows through this album.

If you have been looking to download ""Bolero"" to add to your classical music collection you can't get much better then this. Some people don't like ""Bolero"" and complain that the song just keeps repeating itself going over and over again with the same melody. But the beauty of this song is how as the song keeps playing over and over the same thing it very slowly builds up in intensity. Starting out so softly you have to listen carefully for the opening. By the ending the orchestra is at full volume at its dramatic glory all the while still playing at the same tempo. It is definitely a piece I never grow tired of listening to.

102977,13779,17537,"NOTE - The five star rating is for the performances only. The sound quality gets 2 stars, and here's why: First, the EQ (frequency balance) is way off. This is not a matter of opinion. If you don't already have tinnitus, you will have it after listening to this awfully harsh presentation. Use your own EQ to shave off about 8 dB at around 7 kHz. Peel back a little 12 kHz while you're at it. And boost 70 Hz a tad. There. Now it's not like an ice pick through your eardrums. Second, there is noticeable wow and flutter (tape speed fluctuations) but you may be able to tolerate that. Finally, the pitch sounds like it's a bit sharp (overall tape speed runs fast) but I didn't check it because knowing that would make me sadder. Also be forewarned that there are some blunt between-song edits and at least one song (Ballad of a Thin Man) that is incomplete.

That aside (and I know that's a lot) the show itself is stellar. Dylan is quoted in the liner notes as saying this was a low point in his life, but you wouldn't know it from his performance. He is fierce and edgy, perhaps more than ever. It definitely rivals Before the Flood in terms of unbridled energy. Dylan is even chatty and revealing between songs sometimes, in a way you may not have heard before. If you want a convenient way to obtain this show, here it is. But it's most certainly a bootleg. I'm sure you can find it on line (torrent site or other means) for zero dollars and with much improved sound. Here's hoping there's an official release from this tour (and related studio sessions) very soon!",1485907200,5

103004,17517,10776,"I bought this set on LP in 1970 when I was just 16, though Publishers Central Bureau.  I saved the $19.95 and postage all summer, bought a money order and got the set by early August.  I was in heaven!  And now I have the set on pristine Mp3's thanks to this set, and for an incredible bargain price.  Galling's performances enthralled me then and now.  While some listeners feel his rhythmic precision is overbearing and soulless, I can't agree.  I doubt if Bach would have approved of some of the performances of his works today, with their excessive rubato and ""Romantic"" expression.  The expression is not only in the hands of the performer, but in the music itself.  By simply playing the notes, the expression comes forth without all the stammering and pauses and hesitations that mar so many modern performances in the name of ""expression"".
The harpsichord that Galling uses on these recordings is not like the historically correct instruments most often seen today.  His is a ""revival"" instrument, with stops that never appeared on Baroque instruments, such as a 16' (octave lower), and the curious ""lute"" stop this instrument has. (Galling employs that stop very rarely on these recordings.)  The instrument here is more robust and penetrating that the usual ""historical"" instrument.  Would Bach have approved of it?  I think he might have.  He was always interested in any improvements that could be made to the harpsichord,
It is unfortunate that the insightful and highly informative booklet that accompanied the original LP is not present here, but it is fortunate that the garish original cover art (which looks like packaging for a box of laundry detergent) is absent and replaced by a much more tasteful cover.  The original album was issued by Murray Hill, and I am not sure of the connection with Vox Box.  Vox might have bought the rights from the original label.  In any case it is wonderful that this classic and beautiful album is now available, and for such a bargain.  I can understand that the cost of issuing it on CD's would have been prohibitive, but the savings in cost is worth the inconvenience of downloading.",1485907200,5

What makes this band different is the fact that the front vocalist also plays the saxophone. Rindy stated at one time that she uses the saxophone as an extension of her voice enabling her to put more feeling and emotion to a given song which her voice alone, in her opinion, would not be able to achieve. The self-titled album was released in the latter part of 1981. Almost a year later it went Platinum, meaning more than a Million copies sold. This song is performed impeccably, very well arranged and executed. It is a true classic of the '80s. I like this song very much.

I was immediately impressed by their lively and upbeat performance. The vocals are outstanding. I like the combination of synth and guitar. This album 'Hunting High And Low' was their biggest success. I just love this song. It was covered by other performers, but they could not come even close to the original A-Ha rendition.

103157,16167,7140,"This song was on their first album, self-titled, which was recorded in 1979, released in January 1980. This song was their first hit. It made the charts in the US, Holland and Australia. It was first released as a single before the entire album was finished. A discerning ear can detect some differences between the single and the album version. In my opinion, the differences are insignificant. Their music is very peppy and uplifting. It makes you wanna get up and dance your legs off. I did, back then. Now I'm old and less agile. But when I hear that song my humble gait seems to go through some sort of rejuvenation. I need to listen to it more often. I just love it. The MP3 sound quality is acceptable, actually quite good.",1486080000,5

103240,16167,1165,"This song is part of the self-titled album released by this British group in 1982. Their musical style is best described as New Wave and Synth Pop. It is well performed and peppy. I remember it fondly from seeing and hearing the video on MTV. I read most all of the other reviews. The album cover art is the original design. There appears to be some dispute about the originality and quality of the recording. I have to say that the MP3 sound quality leaves a bit to be desired, which is why I give this only a 4-Star rating. Otherwise, I like the song, even though synth pop and new wave are not my favorite genres. However, this band performs their material very well. I find this song to be very interesting and entertaining.",1486166400,4

Notably, this song is the full length version, not one of those chopped or butchered follow up versions, usually used by radio stations. There is not much I can add to who and what Prince Rodgers Nelson was. Any additional remarks on my part would be quite redundant. I bought the vinyl album back then and played it frequently using high end turntables connected to an audiophile grade system. Years later, I switched to high end CD players and improved analog system technology. I briefly owned the virtual Red Book CD. It sounded just as good as the vinyl, actually cleaner and with improved dynamic range. The MP3 sound quality of this version is amazingly good for this type of format. The DAC (Digital to Analog Converter) I use offsets some of the MP3 file shortfalls, so I am happy with this file. I love the song.",1486166400,5

103272,16167,9335,"This goes way back to 1970. Conway always has been one of favorite country performers ever since he came up with 'It's Only Make Believe', back in 1957. I think he is one of the best. He did get many awards and recognitions. Even while he spent time with Uncle Sam (Far East) he would not cease to entertain. He formed a band and played for the troops. He was born in Mississippi but moved to Arkansas when he was only 10 years old. His actual name is Harold Jenkins. It was determined that he needed a stage name with more ring to it. At one time, he was looking at a road map where he saw at town called Conway in Arkansas and a town in Texas called Twitty. Hence, that was his name from thereon in. This particular song is one of my favorites. This is pure Conway. It is an iconic classic. I have always loved it. This is the actual original single version; the MP3 sound quality is excellent.",1486166400,5

103282,16167,2369,"This song was released in 1973. It was part of the sound track for the movie 'Pat Garrett and Billy The Kid'. This is Bob Dylan at his best. Only he can make a song like this come to life. Well, he did write it. He wrote many songs for other performers, and many other performers covered material that he wrote and performed. This song was covered by 'Guns N' Roses' and 'The Raign', for example. Those versions are not too bad but do not stand a comparison. Some songs just simply need to be performed by Bob himself as the others just can't cut it. This is one of them. It is one of my favorites. I still love it.

103303,1108,948,"I normally don't listen to a lot of modern music, but something about Gotye's hit ""Somebody That I Used To Know"" appealed to me in a strange way.  Perhaps it's the music, which seems to heavily feature xylophone (not necessarily an instrument used in most pop music) and lacks a lot of electronic sound.  Perhaps it's the hypnotic beat and mellow tempo, which while not slow isn't necessarily upbeat either.  Or perhaps it's simply the vocals, which give us a haunting ballad about a failed relationship that a LOT of people can probably relate to.

At any rate, this is an oddly compelling and addictive song, and well worth a listen.  It's quite a departure from most contemporary music, and in this case it's a fantastic thing to find something a little different from the norm.",1486166400,4

Notably, this song is the full length version, not one of those chopped or butchered follow up versions, usually used by radio stations. There is not much I can add to who and what Prince Rodgers Nelson was. Any additional remarks on my part would be quite redundant. I bought the vinyl album back then and played it frequently using high end turntables connected to an audiophile grade system. Years later, I switched to high end CD players and improved analog system technology. I briefly owned the virtual Red Book CD. It sounded just as good as the vinyl, actually cleaner and with improved dynamic range. The MP3 sound quality of this version is amazingly good for this type of format. The DAC (Digital to Analog Converter) I use offsets some of the MP3 file shortfalls, so I am happy with this file. I love the song.",1486166400,5

103352,6803,18339,"Chelsea Grin don't give a f***. Don't believe me? Pick up the lyric sheet for Self Inflicted and...well..it's pretty obvious given the superfluous number of times that claim is made.

Before the hate rolls in, I LOVE Chelsea Grin. From Desolation to Damnation, Evolve to Ashes, the band has proved time and time again they have the chops and rhythmic sensibily to create some exceptionally brutal deathcore. But Self Inflicted is another beast entirely, focusing more on rhythm than any of their other releases.

That fact is what really brings this album down. Sure there are a few really good bangers here (Scratching & Screaming, Broken Bonds, Skin Deep), but the majority of the LP sinks under uninspired chugging and remarkably awful lyrics (Love Song and Clickbait have some real groaners). It's as if CG decided to mash up the styles of early Carnifex and Attila without the former's technical flair and the latter's toungue-poking-through-their-cheeks lyrical bent.

I really wanted to like this more, but a spade is a spade. And a mediocre album is just that. Mediocre. Those who want straight bangers without all that ""riffing"" nonsense will find plenty to love here. Anyone else would be better off delving further back into the band's discography.

For fans of: Emmure, Attila, 0-00-0-00.",1486252800,3

After her divorce from Ike Turner, she went on her own, re-building her career. This song, winner of three Grammy awards, is part of her 5th solo album 'Private Dancer'. It was a world wide success. She was dubbed 'Queen Of Rock'n Roll'. She won 11 Grammy awards. She really rocks, let me tell you. I just love this song and the powerful dynamics. I also like many other tunes performed by her.

103368,1209,19264,I never saw the Movie Hot Pursuit and I came across this track quite by accident. This is a stand alone Elle King song. It is in the style of her eponymous album. It has a country flavour compared to some of her other material and it swings along quickly.

Their voices matched the music and had various levels of dance that made it a good choice.  My best friend hipped me to this duo with the song EVERY STEP EVERY DAY, and I liked what I heard enough to purchase it and it was a good decision.  The only question now is why isn't their base bigger, because they truly deserve it.  I can only hope that they stick together and keep this train moving, because with the talent they possess, they deserve all the accolades they can get.",1486339200,4

103522,9540,17080,"I recently heard this as part of the soundtrack from the Amazon comedy that is set in the 80's called Red Oaks.  I had not heard this song in some time, and it really is a solid and beautiful song.  It is never included with collections of The Cars music (which I also love), so this is one of those ""lost"" tracks that deserves to be right up there with the best tracks of that wonderful musical decade.",1486425600,5

103524,6684,538,"Katy Perry finally came into her own as a singer/songwriter with ""Prism"". ""One of the Boys"" and ""Teenage Dream"" were decent pop records, but I always thought they were too poppy and commercial. On ""Prism"", there's still a handful of glossy pop gems, but there's darker undertones which shows Katy in a different and exciting light. It's funny that the first single, ""Roar"" is the only song that doesn't work. It's a safe and predictable song. Doesn't show much growth. But the album REALLY comes alive with the next track, ""Legendary Lovers"". Wow. One of my favorites here. Love the sitar and catchy chorus. This song will get stuck in your head for sure. ""Birthday"" is fun but not silly. I really enjoy it. It has some flavor to it. ""Walking on Air"" is an ode to '90s House music. I really like this song, probably because I liked this genre of music growing up. Has a great rhythm and flow. ""Unconditionally"" is the first of the ballads. It really shows how strong Katy's voice has gotten over the years. She belts her little heart out. Beautiful and sentimental. ""Dark Horse"" reminds me of ""E.T"" from ""Teenage Dream"". ""Dark Horse"" has a good beat but the rap by Juicy J is pretty bad. Next! ""This is How We Do"" is awesome. I love Katy's wicked sense of humor. ""International Smile"" is a tad corny but it's cute. It's sunny, bright, and very girly. ""Ghost"" is when the darker elements of ""Prism"" start to surface. It's pretty obvious ""Ghost"" is about her failed marriage to Russell Brand. Katy doesn't mince words on this track. She lets herself be vulnerable and raw. This song is special. I love it. ""Love Me"" and ""This Moment"" are very important tracks about self-acceptance and finding balance. Katy's vocals on these 2 songs reminds me of Kelly Clarkson. Again, excellent dark songs. Katy really digs deep here. ""Double Rainbow"" is a superb album cut. Took until the second listen until I realized how poetic this song really is. And finally the song that gets me teary-eyed and gives me chills, ""By the Grace of God"". Her most personal song to date. Her vocals are once again flawless and powerful. The lyrics are just...WOW. She doesn't hold back. This is my first Katy Perry album that I've given 5 stars. This album was not as successful as her last 2 but that doesn't mean it's not good or memorable. With the exception of ""Roar"", ""Prism"" is a top-notch, well-written and well-produced record. Kudos to Katy for taking artistic risk. I highly recommend it. Enjoy!",1486425600,5

103630,10991,1726,I prefer the Live version on Youtube.com but this is all I could find......Awesome song....powerful and great voice.  Most women get stuck in one style of singing and end up having every song sounding the same to the point that you almost could say it's one unending song that only the words of each song changes.....but the way the vocals are sung is exactly the same one after another.......Lauren is very talented and has an amazing voice... She like all women just need to learn to change it up and in the end you could listen to her for hours..... but as I said most songs sound almost the same and an hour of that would make me go insane......But this song is tops of tops.......One of her if not the best song she sings.,1486512000,5

103636,1909,15269,"I owned this on cassette years ago when it first came out and haven't heard it since I jettisoned everything I owned in that obsolete and unsatisfactory medium, so returning to it has been interesting. Almost everything I revisit nowadays sounds better than I had remembered it, as it seems that a generation or two ago we could afford to be pickier about the quality of singing we require; now in days of dearth with both artists gone I am inclined to be more grateful for what they brought to the recording studio.

This is, as a previous reviewer has rightly remarked, a Big Sing. Sutherland certainly sounds rather too beefy, matronly and healthy of voice for a consumptive. She brings little of Cortrubas', Caball's or Callas' delicacy to her portrayal, her vibrato has loosened somewhat, and her portrayal is generalised in comparison with more nuanced accounts, but she is in good voice; her coloratura, portamento and trill are all functioning wonderfully. She also reads Germont's letter with great feeling and dramatically makes more of her dying scene than you might have expected; the middle section of her voice in ""Addio del passato"" is really very beautiful and the famous top notes wholly intact. The husky lower register isn't so pleasing and she isn't really all that believable as our heroine but the singing per se is admirable.

Pavarotti is also mostly in Stand and Sing mode but for many that will be enough and he brings some passion and energy to his Alfredo. His tenor is in prime condition, ringing and honeyed by turns. He is still very good for Levine eleven years later but this remains his best recording. The delight of this recording for his fans will be Matteo Manuguerra's Germont; he sounds suitably grave and middle-aged and I love the slightly nasal timbre of his voice. His legato is exemplary and he thoroughly convinces as Germont pre.

I seem to be in a minority when it comes to my dislike of Sutherland's earlier recording in that I cannot abide what I hear as her persistent flatness on top notes in ""Sempre libera"" and find her mushy diction and mooning manner irksome; her words are more distinct here and she is equally well partnered. Bonynge's direction is fairly leisurely to give his big voices space but the overall effect can be rather leisurely if not soporific. The recorded sound is first rate - spacious and detailed; typical of Decca's best.",1486512000,4

Most turntable anti-skate adjustments are hit and miss at best, but with this disc you can set it spot on. This is a must for anyone who wants their turntable to operate as close to specifications as possible. A how to adjust anti-skate video is available on U-tube using this blank disc and is quite simple to do. Highly recommended as this product performs as it was designed to do......",1486512000,5

103801,16167,11477,"This brings me back to summer of 1960. This song was a #1 hit that year. It features Ben E King as the lead vocalist. By the end of the year, Ben had left the Drifters to pursue a very successful solo career. This song was one of my favorites for that year. I just love the vocals and the orchestral arrangement. The MP3 sound quality could be a little better. I think the original recording was not top notch either. Well, it'll have to do.",1486598400,5

103819,4460,16812,"I didn't believe it when I first saw the music for 'Gimmie Chocolate' but, these three girls from Japan have given us a new musical experience.

They may not play the instruments but, the music is vibrant and fun and very different from their debut album which I am not a fan of. 'Metal Resistance' gives me more of a progressive tone with some very fun listens. I can personally listen to 'Karate' 50 times a day or more. The fact that Baby Metal is out of the vein of NKOTB, Backstreet Boys and N*SYNC is crazy to think because they are not pop.. However, the music has a pop element to it and that is not a bad thing because the music is very much legit.

I don't know what to expect from this trio espeically as they get older. What I am hoping for is that in the end they stick around and are given more liberties towards the album making process. As a rock fan scrounging for rock and heavy metal acts in a fabricated and pointless music world here in the United States. I am hoping that Baby Metal sparks a new Rock/Hard Rock/Heavy Metal revolution.",1486598400,5

It hit the charts again in 1987 when it was part of the sound track for the movie with the same title. It is said that it is one of the greatest songs ever recorded. It was written by Mike Stoller and Jerry Leiber. They wrote many songs performed by Elvis Presley, wouldn't you know. It was voted to be one of the 'Songs Of The Century'. That alone speaks for itself. It is one of my personal all-time favorites. The MP3 sound quality is about as good as it can be.",1486598400,5

The version on the DVD was the finale, where Jackson sings some of the lines, then the band plays while he signs autographs. He gives his farewell, and finishes singing the number.  I was hoping for something like his video, available on youtube.
I'm not really a C&W fan, except for country rock.  There are some songs I would consider rockin' on this DVD.  Alan Jackson fans should really like this DVD.  They would probably rate it 4 or 5 stars.",1486684800,3

I saw Natalie perform this song at the Super Bowl Gospel celebration in Houston, and the audience was awestruck. The chorus stayed in my head, and i immediately had to purchase the song.

103906,17601,18076,"In a fabulous return to form, Peter Gabriel released ""I'm Amazing"" to help celebrate the life of Muhammad Ali. The song could have come  right off of Gabriel's previous collection of original material, ""Up,"" which now dates back on an almost geologic timescale to 2002. Moody, somewhat disturbing with grinding electronic sounds and rizzing guitar, this song exudes pure Gabriel in every beat. At seven and a half minutes long, it delivers plenty of succulent ear candy and variations on intensity ranging from reflective mellowness to skull vibrating pounding percussion. It also ends in a perfect Gabriel-esque fashion with world music singing and chanting overlayed with buzz-saw guitar riffs. In a recent interview, Gabriel claimed that he wants to write more ""happy music."" Though this song isn't unhappy by any means, it probably isn't what his quote refereed to. This song digs deep and unearths treasures and a even few monsters. It rattles foundations. It evokes harrowing imagery. It grooves while it disturbs. The Gabriel that digs down deep into human consciousness and returns with the unexpected or the unwanted has returned. May he soon release more gems similar to ""I'm Amazing.""",1486771200,5

103960,12301,20068,"Benjamin Cooper describes this release as A Frankenstein of random genealogy charts, my own family history, some of my personal experiences and plain old fiction, all revolving around the Northcote family.

Its hard to know whether the man is putting us on or not, as his entire Family Tree catalog is based around the assumption that these songs are based on himself and his relationship with his family, both real and unrealized.  Its also evident that the songs themselves are perhaps the family he's talking about where strikingly sparse, yet gently layered songs nearly rise from the moss laden earth, or drift down from ancient trees, in a place thats off the map, thats been forgotten by time, where the intermingling of familiar relationships has become so intertwined, that perhaps this spot on no ones map should remain out of step, out of time, and shielded from the eyes of the outside world.

Yet Cooper himself has been spiriting out these musical postcards of sorts laced with snips of information, faded photographs, and dauntingly smooth expectations of atmospheric intensity.  There is nothing hurried on this release, one laid out with the simplicity of a steady hand, though perhaps unsure or incomplete conceptual thoughts, played out with only an acoustic guitar, limited percussions and a piano.

The term bastards, and this is why I believe the songs are his family, is that Benjamin Cooper claims that these numbers didn't contribute to the rest of the family tree [or albums], that they didn't manifest themselves in a manner that allowed them to thematically unfold in the way he had intended  in short, making them outcasts.  Yet even these outcasts [songs] have lives of their own, are beautiful in their own right, bigger than life, standing with pride and purpose, even if alone.  For the first time hes gathered these misfits together in one place, his B Sides and superlative singles, creating a separate branch on this family tree that will grow and morph into a wholly realized grouping that needs to be recognized and given sanctuary, no longer held at arms length, but embraced for all the beauty and wisdom they embody.

Theres a cinematic presence to this album, presented with ambitious indie folk story telling, revealing not so much supernatural secrets, but secrets of the heart that too many of us keep hidden, compartmentalized, yet sustained in the dark with nurturing breath.

The Fun Facts:  Cooper chose the name Radical Face upon seeing it on a flyer. He later found out it was a plastic surgery flyer saying 'Radical Face-Lift' with the word 'lift' ripped off.

Ben Cooper claims that his bodies of work are all about the ability or not, to trust.

103961,396,8321,"THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE 2017 2 CD EDITION ON THE BGO LABEL.

Just so you know--I've been listening to Stoneground since 1970, own the original vinyl LPs, and heard them live.  So my review may be biased just a bit.

This is a new 2017 ""mastered in high definition"" edition of Stoneground's first and third albums.  The second album, ""Family"", was reissued in 2016 on the same label.  That album was originally a 2 LP set with three live sides and one studio side of songs.  And while it continues to be the band's most popular album, this latest 2 CD set has some very fine performances too.  In some ways the first self-titled  album is just as good as ""Family"", with a certain vibe that you could hear all through the album.  The third album imaginatively titled ""3"", has some good performances too, but a slight radio friendly slickness had crept into some of the songs.

The sound is very good--clean, fairly open, and with a slight warmth similar to the vinyl LPs.  The vocals are up front in the mix just right with the band perfectly mixed just under the vocals.  There's no compression to ruin the original sound.  There's an 18 page booklet (with color repros of the two album covers--why BGO put ""3"" on the front of the booklet and the band's first album cover (with legendary radio DJ/Autumn Records executive/producer  Tom Donahue wearing a tie-dye t-shirt) on the back of the booklet--is strange.  Inside is  a lengthy essay on the band, the era, and the music.  Plus (because Sal Valentino was from that good S.F. band the Beau Brummels)  a history lesson on who Beau Brummel was.  Also here is the first album's liner notes and band photos, lyrics to the album ""3"", and recording information for both albums plus band personnel.  The jewel case slips inside a card sleeve similar to other BGO releases.

This ten member band (eleven  on ""3"") had five strong vocalists in Sal Valentino and four female vocalists.  Instrumentally the band had a great sound, especially Tim Barnes on guitar.  But the entire band projected that S.F. sound and feel of what passed as a hippie family kind of band in the truest traditions of late '60s/early '70s S.F. bands.  They released three albums on the Warner Bros. label before being dropped for lack of sales.  There's a live album on another label that's available on CD.  Three members went on to form the band Pablo Cruise to popular acclaim.  I still have memories of hearing the band just once, with the stage taken over by a lot of musicians and a bunch of moving, energetic female vocalists, in typical for the era long swirling dresses, headbands, and ""hippie jewelry"", who traded off lead vocals depending on the song.  Curiously I don't remember Valentino making as big an impression on me as the four ""chick"" (as they were referred to back then) singers, which made quite an impression live.

The band's first album to my ears is just as good as ""Family"", even if it is a studio recording.  The band had an energy even in the studio that could be heard and felt on the first album.  The vocals are great and instrumentally the band is very tight with a certain loose vibe that was very appealing.  By the third album there seemed to be at times a radio-friendly sound to some of the songs.  The band (now with an eleventh member on horns and a few replacement band members) was still capable of that Stoneground sound (courtesy of Valentino, the female quartet of singers, and guitarist Tim Barnes), but you could feel that things weren't going too well--the original vibe was missing just a bit.  But there's some good/great songs on ""3"" that make this final Warner Bros. album well worth hearing.

Chances are that if you're reading this you're already familiar with Stoneground.  But if you want the three albums above in newly mastered sound and with good packaging, this is the way to go.  And if Stoneground is new to you, and you like bands from S.F. from the '60s/early '70s, you might wan to check out this 2 CD set and the 2 CD reissue of ""Family"".  Stoneground was a microcosm of that era in S.F.--a free-wheeling, male/female, multi-racial band--with great vocalists and a good instrumental sound.  With the reissue of these two albums, plus ""Family"", a musical prayer of mine has been answered.",1486771200,4
103962,1108,4720,"I'm aware that ""More Than Words"" is a rather atypical hit for the band Extreme, which leans more toward the harder spectrum of music than a mellow guitar song would suggest.  That doesn't prevent me from enjoying this song, which is a melancholy but ultimately heartfelt song about asking a loved one to show their love instead of just using empty words.  It's a very simple song in its message, in the instrumentation that consists solely of a single guitar, and in the laid-back and unadorned (and un-auto-tuned) voices of the singers.  And sometimes, a simple song works nicely.",1486771200,4

103981,56,4564,"It is just so sad that whenever someone young and talented passes away so soon, you're really often reminded of the great talent they left behind at the soul. Al Jarreau has had so many great songs from jazz and pop that floated very brilliantly at the heart, and each time I really do hear one of his song, I really love his soulful gift at the heart. But when I do think of all of the songs that he brilliantly sung since the 70's, all I can absolutely think of is just one simple song that still ignites at the soul from television. The theme from the Bruce Willis 80's show Moonlighting, which has been enriched at the heart. The theme from Moonlighting still shows a brilliance in jazz and the engrained heart of pop culture. It is still one of those deep guilty pleasure songs that works today, just like it did back in the 80's, 90's and 2000's. Al really had a gift from the heart that swooned so many people time and time again. He will definitely be missed every time you hear the moonlight soul. He will be missed with each and every beat.

103982,9151,18222,"If you listen to their older stuff, it can at times sound like a heavier Incubus with elements of Helmet and other bands of the late mid to late 90's. I feel like they've evolved past that and have a more modern sound, ready to carry them to 2020. ""Divided... Conquer"" is maybe the best song they've ever made, and it reflects the new direction. I'm very pleased with this album except for 'Radio Chorus' which sounds like someone's kid brother wrote it. Overall, a solid album though. It's up there with 'Development' and 'Recoil' for me.",1486857600,4

104094,9069,14878,"The Strawberry Alarm Clock woke up Top 40 radio in December 1967 with the trippy Incense and Peppermints, a song which only hinted at the depth of musical sophistication present in the bands repertoire.  Riddled with, and perhaps because of, personnel changes over its five-album history, SAC offered a mix of intelligent songwriting, sonic exploration, jazz-inflected arrangements, and Southern California harmonies, almost always performed without the aid of session musicians.  Nearly a half-century later, SAC has regrouped, offering remakes of eight songs pulled from their first three albums, along with other new and cover material.  So how do these sixty-somethings fare compared to their 18-year-old younger selves?  Surprisingly well!  Stalwarts Lose to Live, Hummin Happy, and Barefoot in Baltimore are delivered with additional punch, and newbies World Citizen, Drifting Away, and Wake Up show a band that hasn't lost its edge.  Even Strawberries Mean Love, in spite of its sugary, summer-of-love lyrics, curls through the same rich, layered vocal harmonies that were carried on by the likes of Steely Dan, Wilson Phillips, The Bangles, and even Yes.  SAC graciously acknowledges its influences, dedicating Wake Up to, among others, Mark Tulin, the late bassist for The Electric Prunes, a psychedelic contemporary of the original SAC.  The band is purportedly working on a full album of new material.  Itd be nice to have a redecorated Incense and Peppermints added to that set.  In the end, its all just music.  Who cares what games we choose?  Little to win, but nothin to lose . . .",1487030400,4

104104,7782,10809,"The whole album ""John Barleycorn Must Die"" by Traffic is an amazing album.  It does not have a single bad or even mediocre track. For me the title tune stands out. Even after all the decades it still fires an emotional response and does not get old.

The song itself an old folk song which is anti-prohibition and as performed by Traffic is a little sorrowful sounding to me. Almost as if sung in mourning. In the end we know that prohibition ended as the song predicts with ""and little Sir John with his nut brown bowl proved the strongest man at last""

Back in the days when this came out I was in a local band playing guitar. Traffic was one of those influential sources that inspired us and became part of the soundtrack of that portion of my life.

John Barleycorn Must Die is a classic song with an iconic performance that has stood up well for at least 47 years so far. Such was the magic of Traffic in their prime. Without question 5 stars from Traffic",1487030400,5

After ""Beggars"", ""Let It Bleed"", ""Sticky Fingers"", ""Exile"", and even ""It's Only RnR"" to a greater extent ""Black & Blue"" just didn't have the Rock n Roll punch that we'd come to expect from the boys. It has a Reggae feel on some songs and Reggae had not caught on yet with us R n R fans in the states. In fact I saw Toots & The Maytalls open for The Who on their ""Who By Numbers"" tour and they were treated rather rudely by the Springfield, Mass crowd. Well all these years later I decided to pull out my copy of Black & Blue only to find that I hadn't purchased a CD version. So I ordered a copy from Amazon and played it to death. It was so ahead of its time. If you are a Stones fan you'll love it and should own it. But then again, unlike me...you probably do.",1487116800,5

104131,14479,11614,"First and foremost, this is NOT a brand new Bangles album.  It is the very first recordings from rhythm guitarist/vocalist Susanna Hoffs, drummer/vocalist Debbi Peterson, lead guitarist/vocalist Vicki Peterson, and then-bassist Annette Z.  (Michael Steele would join the band in 1984 and eventually left in 2007.)

This is the first raw, unpolished, rock 'n' roll taste of what the sweet, choral harmonies of the Southern California all-girl band sounded like in 1981 before they hit it big 5 years later with the Prince-penned ""Manic Monday"" and mega-smash ""Walk Like An Egyptian.""  2 of the songs, ""Getting Out Of Hand"", and ""Call On Me"", were previously released as B-sides to the band's 2003 single ""Something That You Said.""  2 delicious, savory live tracks, along with several demos, are also included on this disc.

104132,16167,6298,"This song was released in January 1971. It covered the original version composed and performed by John Fogerty of Creedence Clearwater Revival fame, released in early 1969. This cover song was Ike and Tina's best selling single, winning them a Grammy Award. I have always been hard pressed to decide which version I like better. Both have their own charm. I think Tina put a bit more power, soul and meaning to it than John F. I like how Tina's version starts up slow and easy but builds up to a fast paced rhythmic crescendo. Well done.

RIP John Wetton.  The songs are very good. I do not know if shorter versions were performed or long ones edited down (Starless is only 4-plus minutes on this release).

This is true Irish folk music, joyful, peppy and entertaining. It got my attention back then and stuck with me to this date. Great tune. The MP3 sound quality is ok.",1487203200,5

104204,16167,2652,"This girl group from NYC started to sing together during childhood in the '50s. In 1963, after several unsuccessful attempts in the music and show business, they finally linked up with famed record producer Phil Spector. By then, the group called themselves 'The Ronettes,' named after lead singer Veronica Bennett (Ronnie) who eventually married Phil Spector, then becoming known as Ronnie Spector. This song, which is performed impeccably, turned out to be a huge hit for the Ronettes. It actually influenced artists such as Brian Wilson of Beach Boys fame and Cher. Many other hits followed. 'Be My Baby' was one of my personal top favorites for the year 1963. The vocal and instrumental arrangements are outstanding. I just love this song. It is a true timeless classic.",1487203200,5

A curious artifact more than anything else, LOVE ME BY NAME dares to show a different side of the former Queen of the Teen Weepers, but after listening to this album a dozen times I still don't know exactly what she or producer Quincy Jones were going for here. Theres a common celestial vibe that runs through most of whats here. The title track is a strange hybrid of space-age jazz, while the hyper PARANOIA comes off as something that was cut from THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW although Lesley does spit out the lyrics convincingly enough. IMMORTALITY tries to be both futuristic and retro and echoes First Class hit single BEACH BABY on the chorus.

Five NASCENT Stars! Of all of the hundreds of vocal versions of the Henry Mancini/Johnny Mercer composition, ""Moon River"", over the years, perhaps the simplest, most effective, and affecting is the very first version which was sung by Audrey Hepburn. Strumming her guitar with violins and celeste in the background during 'the fire escape scene' with George Peppard in the movie ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"", she nailed it vocally. And the song was in danger of being cut from the movie until Mancini and especially Hepburn fought hard to keep it in and, as they say, the rest is history: winning 2 Grammies for Song and Record of the Year, an Oscar, and enjoying great popularity ever since. Sung simply and sweetly, Hepburn is excellent in telling her believable tale about love, hope, wonder, and a river, in one pass through the lyrics. Mancini himself calls this his favorite version of the song. ""My huckleberry friend"", indeed! My Highest Recommendation. Five MEMORABLE Stars. (RCA Victor records.

I have all 4 of the albums with Muireann Nic Amhlaoibh, and this one is certainly as good as the rest. From the rousing opening track, Kerry to Donegal Set, to the dreamy closer, The Willow Tree, this album proves that time has been good to Danu.
Sadly, Nic Amhlaoibh is no longer with the group, but she has three fine albums out on her own (one with Julie Fowlis, Dual, which is also great).
Her voice is magical and is in very fine form here.",1487376000,5

104349,3204,20103,"This is Bombino's best album yet.  He has had a lot of buzz around him-- or at least, as much buzz as one can for ""world"" music, but his releases so far have been just short of great.  Very good, but not quite great.  This one is great.

Tuareg style guitar music should appeal generally to fans of the late-great Ali Farka Toure, but where Tinariwen tends to sound a bit too busy for me, Bombino just gets it right.  On ""Guitars from Agadez: Vol. 2,"" it was basically a field recording.  Awesome for what it is, but Bombino deserves a proper showcase.  ""Agadez"" gave him better production, but was a bit heavy on the drone style.  ""Nomad"" was overproduced, as far as I was concerned.

Here's the goldilocks Bombino album.  Well-produced, but still free-wheeling.  Some electric, some acoustic.  Some scorching riffs, some rock influences, some blues influences, some reggae influences, and the general aesthetic of a more Arabic-sounding Ali Farka Toure.  If that's your thing, Bombino's ""Azel"" delivers.  This is the one I've been waiting for.  Is he some sort of Saharan Hendrix, as some have said?  No.  Nonsense.  Those kinds of comparisons are ridiculous, and frankly, Hendrix was no Bola Sete, to make an even sillier comparison.  Enough of that nonsense.  Bombino rocks.  This album is great.  Get it.",1487376000,5

104376,16167,2099,"Ever since The Band Perry appeared on the scene of what I would call 'New Country' I have liked them a lot. They are one of my favorite bands of the era after 2000. For the most part, they maintain a flavor of classic country stemming from a time before hard rock and heavy metal oriented musicians migrated into the country genre of music. I think this occurred sometime during the '90s when heavy metal of the late '70s and '80s style fell out of vogue and heavy metal turned into some semi-melodic boring and uninspiring noise, in my opinion. This song, released in 2013 on their album 'Pioneer' was a hit for TBP. It is a wonderful song, masterfully performed by Kimberley; the back-up vocals are very sweet and harmonious. I just love it. In fact, I like the whole album. I have purchased it on virtual CD. I am an audiophile. The MP3 format does not always fill the ticket for discerning ears and a high end audio system. The MP3 download sound quality of this song is better than what I had expected, though.",1487462400,5

How great is it to get a hybrid SACD along with this blu-ray?  I can rip the stereo track off it to be able to listen in my iems while I walk.
OK, lots of talk about the technical side because I don't know much about improve piano.  I just know what I like, and this is it, it is beautiful, moving and engaging-much more than I expected.  I put this music right up there with Keith Jarrett in Koln.  And that is the highest praise indeed.
IF you play this back on a great music system it will reward you with terrific sonics, it is truly listen-worthy. Or just play it as background music (yeah, I hate that term and idea) during a romantic dinner, it still works.  Fine music, superbly recorded!!!!",1487635200,5

Every song from Dark Star>Playin' was space city! Nice fresh take on all of these. The Brokedown Palace to end this disc sounds like something Richard Wright would sing in the Pink Floyd. The Terrapin on disc 3 is... dare I say- maybe better than the studio Dead version, wow- i can't imagine how much time it took to get all of these musicians and parts together. I also loved the Jack-A-Roe by This Is The Kit with Kate Stables on vocals, it reminded me of Fairport with Sandy Denny!

Not only has the sound been reproduced but the self-deprecating, inventive song-writing as well.  The originals are strong, affective tunes that sound like they came straight from Bell's hand.  The playing is stellar; the musicians are empathetic; and the whole ensemble even sounds like a band that Bell might have put together.

104475,16167,827,"I spent 8 years with Uncle Sam as a volunteer. I can wholeheartedly relate to this song, every bit of it. I joined back in the '70s, at the age of 30, after a divorce. I did not do it for the pay. I left a job that paid me a little over $ 800.- per month versus the $ 309.- per month as a Private E-1 for a starter. Well, that is history. Yes, I did it purely for patriotic reasons. During the Nam War, my draft lottery number did not come up. Then I turned 26 and was married. At one time I mentioned to my wife that I was thinking about joining the Army for a while. She wanted no part of it. Well, then I had my chance. I served, after all, and I'm darn proud of it. I spent almost all of my time in Europe during the Cold War. We never knew when an alert would be just an exercise or the real thing. It was scary at times. Again, that's history. I love Toby's song. It speaks out of my heart. That's about all I can say.",1487635200,5

It should serve as a reminder to all of us as to who we are and what we should represent and what we value, such as our freedom which has cost it's price on several occasions throughout our history, starting in 1776.
This is the album version from 1992. It is very good, even though a version released in 1990 has more appeal to some folks. It doesn't really matter that much. Any of Lee's versions of this wonderful song will bring the message across. That is what really matters, I think.

104497,9874,16588,"Their song This Ladder Is Ours is what drove me to Amazon to see what else the band had done, after listening to Hitch I came back for another and now (some 24 hours later) have everything they have done including some of the songs which are so good they richly merited having different arrangements done, some are very different arrangements, a few are acoustic and several are live. As another reviewer posted Ritzy is dazzling with an audience. The world is a better place for having The Joy Formidable in it.

Their live music is a set of great recordings which isn't an easy thing to do and their studio records are very well produced without being over-produced which allows a certain amount of live playing and passion to come through that is often missing from a studio produced albums over-produced which takes all of the genuine human emotion of the their playing and singing and otherwise giving such albums a sort of canned sound to them.",1487635200,5

104537,17659,13803,"I'm happy to report that I'm perfectly satisfied with ""As I See It Now"" by Melanie.  Since it's one of my obscure and lesser known albums: I couldn't help wondering if it would ever find its way onto CD!  Can't you just imagine?  Upon discovering its availability, however: I couldn't wait to order it as soon as possible!  Upon receiving it: I found right away that it met my expectations completely!  The CD contains the entire contents of the vinyl; plus an enjoyable bonus track.  Furthermore: Melanie's rendician of the song ""Don't Think Twice: It's Alright"" is unlike any other version I'd ever heard!  Whenever I hear that song by a diferent singer: I can't help wondering how many versions of it are out there altogether!  Definitely sheer audible ecstasy all the way!  Care to speculate?  Anyhow: I love every single song on this CD; as I've loved them on my record for years!  Furthermore: Now that I'm fortunate enough to own it: No amount of money on earth could persuade me to part with it!  Furthermore: I'd highly recommend it to any ""Serious"" Melanie Fan.  It's definitely an accurate demonstration of Melanie's many talents and versatility; as well as her many diverse styles of singing!  If you're a serious collector of rare and hard-to-find albums: You'd better grab this one while its still obtainable!  Furthermore, if you don't: You'll definitely be sorry!",1487808000,5

104589,5777,3692,"Probably the most popular and certainly the most well known song by one of the greatest rock groups from the '60s. If ever there was a song that helped define the mood and feelings for baby boomers during the mid to late '60s you could make a good case for The Doors ""Light My Fire"". Approximately 6:30 minutes in length it broke the conventional rule of radio that a song couldn't or at least shouldn't be more then three minutes long. But the song would get plenty of air play. With its psychodellic tone and mesmerizing organ solo and of course Jim Morrison's voice it is easy to see once you combine all these elements together why this is such an outstanding recording. If you are a child of the 1960s this is a must to down load on your MP3 player.",1487808000,5

104600,14212,16876,"Wow! That was my first impression after taking a listen to this album that was released in April 2016. This one is a bit older but is just catching on after Sturgill was nominated for two Grammy Awards (including Album of the Year). He won one Grammy for Best Country Album. I discovered the album just this week and this album is HOT! HOT! HOT! and in my mind should have won Album of the Year but of course Adele ""25"" won, which itself is an excellent album - but ""A Sailor's Guide To Earth"" is far more diverse, versatile and overall a much stronger album than ""25.""

Sturgill Simpson shows bits of David Gray, Alex Clare, Van Morrison and Ronnie Milsap. He is an old soul at the young age of 38. He writes songs with the wisdom of a sailor who has sailed the seas of life for twice the amount of decades of his actual age.

""A Sailor's Guide To Earth"" is categorized as a country music album and has climbed to #1 on both the country music and rock music charts as well as #1 on the folk music charts. It has also reached #3 on billboard's Top 200 albums chart. This week the album re-entered the Billboard chart at #44 with a bullet.

Though categorized as a country music album it is far more versatile than simply a country album. The depth in musicianship and lyrics puts the album in a category all it's own. This is quite simply one of the most intriguing albums of the past 20 years.

This album is full of introspection, joy and great guitar and synthesizer sounds... and Sturgill wrote all the songs to boot (except the cover of Nirvana's ""In Bloom"").

The album opens with the sounds of ship's bell chiming (a sound you hear on other songs throughout the album) and the beautiful tinkling of keyboards. ""Welcome To Earth"" sounds like a refreshing ocean morning relaxing in the mist of the ocean air. Three minutes in the song turns into a surprising upbeat Motown flavored experience with horns and R&B rhythms. As a matter of fact The Dap-Kings (famous for playing behind Sharon Jones) are the credited horn section on this song and several others on the album.

The otherworldly ""Breakers Roar"" is soothingly beautiful accented with country tinged steel guitars bringing out an ethereal sound that gives the song a floating feel. This song screams David Gray but so much more in it's intensity and beauty.

""Keep It Between The Lines"" is a traditional country song that breaks out with a high-stepping brass section very reminiscent of 1979 era Ronnie Milsap. This immediately made me think of Milksop's '79 hit ""Get It Up."" The song features some hot licking slide guitar and awesome electric guitar. The rhythm section fires up the funk keeping it all in a traditional country music style.

""In Bloom"" is the only song not written by Sturgill Simpson. ""In Bloom"" was written by Kurt Cobain and was featured on the 1992 Nirvana album ""Nevermind."" Sturgill took the song and made it all his own with an intense delicate power working into a storm of emotion and a wall of sound production.

Brace For Impact (Live A Little)"" is my favorite song from the album for many reasons. I love the David Gilmour style guitar chords and the music video is eerie and amazing. Simpson sings this anthemic song with conviction and intensity like no other singer of this decade. ""Brace For Impact"" is not what you would expect to hear on a country music album. With it's pulsating electric bass opening it is a song that sounds like it could have been written for a Pink Floyd album all the while maintaining it's country music influence. ""Brace For Impact"" is a song about death and how different people react to it's inevitability. Sturgill's dark guitars and electronic synthesizer drive this song and turn it into an event in music that should not be missed.

""All Around You"" is a great 1950s blues style country song while ""Oh Sarah"" is that country song filled with hurt, pain and joy.

The album closes with one of it's strongest songs. ""Call To Arms"" starts of with the distant sound of seagulls, ship bells and bag pipes. The bag pipes add this unusual sort of ocean sound to the song - it works quite well. Quickly the song turns funky with R&B honky tonk horns that makes the song feel like something you might have heard in the explosive 1980 film ""The Blues Brothers."" Let me tell you the guitar work in this song is absolutely killer. I am a huge fan of the guitar and Sturgill ranks right up there with the best of the best. The bluesy piano parts rock this song out which at points reminds me just a little bit of Elvis Presley.

""A Sailor's Guide To Earth"" is one of those albums that has surprises around each corner. The musical texture is as diverse as it gets and best of all Sturgill Simpson is a really great singer. I highly recommend this album to anyone that is an avid fan of diversity in music.",1487894400,5

104687,1895,20128,"Multiple Grammy Award winner in both jazz and classical categories, Maria Schneider has a unique enveloping big band sound wrapped around rich brass harmonies, lyrical yet complex reed and horn solos, and the added timbre of accordion and guitar. Her Orchestra in this particular session has guest soloist Ingrid Jensen on trumpet and flugelhorn, heard on The Pretty Road. Schneider had simultaneous training in jazz and classical music, and her jazz arrangements reflect classical structural development; yet she is open to other influences, such as world music and its different rhythms. Her experience in Peru led to learning 12/8, 5/4, and 3/8 meters, which led to the second track Aires de Lando. The multi-reedman Scott Robinson tackles the ever changing beats with aplomb on clarinet. Tenor saxophonist Rich Perry's slow, reflective solo is featured in the following piece. The 22-minute Cerulean Skies, which itself was a Grammy winner, highlights work by saxophonists Donny McCaslin and Charles Pillow as well as accordionist Gary Versace. Like Olivier Messiaen, birds have a role in the composition, and some of the musicians mimic them by voice or with their instruments or with whistles, but a recording of a cerulean warbler is heard at the end. Vaughan Williams composed the delightful Lark Ascending, and in this musical essay on ornithology, Schneider offers her take on a flight of another bird.  Brazilian vocalist Luciana Souza adds vocalise. Sky Blue has the soprano saxophone of Steve Wilson to close out the album. Special mention should go to the Orchestra's usual sidemen Clarence Penn on drums, Frank Kimbrough on piano, and Jay Anderson on bass. I recently attended a concert of the Orchestra and their clever ornamentation and support were important as spice in a meal. Schneider's music is not Third Stream as Gunther Schuller had envisioned, nor is it free jazz (like Oregon and Esbjrn Svensson Trio); rather her music is firmly jazz but with classical sensitivity. Ellington would understand. Listening to this album is as if snuggling under a warm blanket and enjoying a natural landscape.",1487980800,5

However, this album is very beautiful and adds to the eclectic music of TSFH. I want to point out that Thomas Bergersen composed this entire album but it was released as a TSFH album since many of these songs were released on previous industry albums. I would not recommend buying this if you are new to TSFH as it does not represent what they are most famous for. However, I would recommend buying this if you prefer softer pieces and songs that almost sound like pop music (I think Thomas created a new genre of music with this album - ""epic pop"", listen to ""My Freedom"" and you'll see what I mean), or if you have everything else from TSFH and want more. This is definitely a must if you are a diehard TSFH fan. If you are new to TSFH I would recommend Battlecry, Vanquish, Illusions, or Sun. The former two if you want epic courageous music, and the latter two if you primarily want epic emotional/beautiful music.
Highlights of this album include: Miracles, Compass (especially the bonus track), My Freedom, Fountain of Life, Color the Sky, Breath of Cold Air, Wind Queen, Lost in Las Vegas.",1487980800,5

104727,16310,136,"In ""X,"" Ed Sheeran's follow-up to his stunning debut ""+,"" he continues to dazzle with a wide variety of musical styles, all tied together with his trademark combination of rapid-fire rapping and mellow singing.  In the ""Wembley"" deluxe edition, listeners are treated to some extra studio tracks, including the dance-inspired collaboration with Rudimental ""Lay It All On Me,"" along with live recordings of ""Small Bump"" and ""The Parting Glass"" performed at Wembley.  The raw emotion of the live tracks contrasts with the slick studio sound of ""Lay It All on Me,"" which follows immediately afterwards, as well as some of gentler numbers such as the hit single ""Thinking Out Loud.""

In fact, contrast is the name of the game in ""X.""  Musical experimentation abounds: there's the aforementioned rap (""Don't,"" ""Take It Back,"" ""The Man""), rap-pop hybrids (""Nina,"" ""Touch and Go""), energetic and/or tortured guitar-pop (""I'm a Mess,"" ""Sing,"" ""Runaway""), some really schmalzy pop (this is where Sheeran tends to lose me, but I can recognize the talent even in ""Thinking Out Loud,"" which I find so sappy I can hardly bear to listen to it), and folk-, blues-, and bluegrass-inspired numbers.  This profusion of styles pretty much guarantees that any given listener is going to have strong favorite and non-favorites, but it also means there's something here to like for almost anyone, and no one is going to be bored.

As with the multifaceted musical sound, lyrically, the album does not at first glance tell one unified story or work as a single cycle; rather, multiple thought-strands and preoccupations come up again and again. The lyrical persona goes back and forth between outrage at romantic betrayal (""Don't,"" ""The Man""), regret at relationships that can't work (the outstanding ""Nina,"" ""Touch And Go,""), and the pink flush of love (""Thinking Out Loud,"" ""Tenerife Sea"").  In fact, though, there *is* a theme that pulls everything together: the singer's overwhelming drive to find success and his rock-hard self-belief, which tears apart his romantic life, threatens his family connections, and puts him at odds with his record company.  The ""Ed Sheeran"" (in quote marks because there's ""Ed Sheeran"" the lyrical persona, and Ed Sheeran the real person) of ""+"" was a young, naive, bleeding-heart kind of a guy; the ""Ed Sheeran"" of ""X"" is a little more cynical and a lot more concerned about the cost of the sudden success that's been thrust upon him.  ""X"" is in a certain respect the story of someone whose dreams have all come true: the question that follows is ""Now what?""  Does, the singer of ""X"" asks, success mean just an endless round of plane trips, punctuated by grim events like writing your will and arguing with your record company?  What kind of dreams do you have to give up to have all your dreams come true?

Which is not to say that the ""Ed Sheeran"" of ""X"" is gloomy and cast down.  On the contrary, he's full of energy and fight, ready to kick unfaithful lovers to the curb and spit braggadocio-filled lyrics about his talent and meteoric rise to the top of the charts.  Which, especially sandwiched between the softer songs, is charming.  But it does the beg the question (okay, it doesn't: the answer is staring us all in the face) of why Sheeran is treated so differently from his sometimes-collaborator and fellow pop prodigy Taylor Swift: the occasional critic might not be won over by Sheeran's message, but he seems to have escaped the criticism Swift experiences for using her personal life to fuel her music, for being calculated and driven, and (oh, the horror!) for not being ""inclusive"" enough in her feminism.  ""X"" is the album of a musician who unabashedly uses his personal life as artistic material, and openly wants to get ahead.  And the result is deservedly a smash hit.  But it's something that perhaps only Sheeran could get away with.",1488067200,5

104731,128,1828,"Though already covered extensively in rap and hip hop, the principles of knowledge, moral lessons and social activism can never become cliche as long as they are presented and packaged correctly, and as long as they are coming from an individual of character. They are at the core of the culture's goals alongside having a good time, challenging popular thought, and expressing oneself artistically and creatively. Already well experienced in the rap game, Queens, New York emcee Cormega makes effective use of his time by employing these principles in Mega Philosophy, a collaboration album with the legendary Large Professor serving as producer. Cormega is by far more mature than he has ever been. He stresses many points including achieving inner peace through questioning, keeping an open mind, persevering, and taking personal responsibility. In fact the whole album revolves around the theme of maintaining a strong mental state, which is the secret to life. Cormega's smooth flow of intelligent rhymes coupled with the Large Professor's no-frills beats make for classical hip hop listening, and the guest emcees, Redman, AZ, Styles P, Nature, Raekwon, and Black Rob, all contribute very hot, very smart verses. If Mega seems to get redundant, he is only paraphrasing, putting his lessons in other words to get through to his listeners; thus, he never gets dull. Driving his points home in a little more than thirty minutes, he is also concise with no fluff or fillers. Cormega and the Large Professor have not invented any groundbreaking formulas but instead simply combine their talents to make good, authentic hip hop for what might be one of the year's best rap albums.",1488067200,4

Nutty and bonkers, Riff Raff discusses his life and issues but mostly his fashion, flash and love for the wild side. There is certainly potential in his lyrical abilities, but he just needs to hone and develop them a little more. The varied rhymes are enough to satisfy the hardcore hip hop fans, and the club friendly beats will sate the tech heads, dancers and boppers. Refreshing are the guest features. Look out for Childish Gambino, Mac Miller, Slim Thug, Paul Wall and other great musical artists. From one perspective, Neon Icon is a sign of what types of good things are possible from Riff Raff, but overall it is a little too unfocused and a little too influenced by other bling and crunk rap acts from the past and present.",1488067200,2

104738,128,1846,"Rakaa Iriscience, Evidence, and DJ Babu of Dilated Peoples are back with another group LP after a long eight year hiatus since the 2006 release of their 20/20 album. In this considerable gap of time, the guys have kept busy doing various, individual side albums, collaborations, and other projects. Apparently the timeout must have inspired member appreciation of how valuable their combined chemistry really is because this 2014 Directors Of Photography album ranks equally with any one of their previous albums, which set a more ambitious standard for conscious hip hop with each consecutive release. The hallowed LA triumvirate are essentially back to their specialty, kicking tight, crafty hip hop rhymes and lyrics over elegant, soulful beats that are expertly put together, samples included. Fans can look forward to more life lessons on which to ponder and more unique attitudes, opinions, perspectives and philosophies to consider. In addition to the mental, metaphysical goodies on the album, Rakaa and Evidence also dabble in some tough-talk rapping, which means they believe in what they're saying, they are not speaking on some loose whim, and they can back up their words with strong reasoning. Every track on the album is a gem, but a few really stand out. ""Show Me The Way"" sounds like it could be a radio song. It's motivational, and it's got a great beat, a great hook, and great lyrics behind it. ""Figure It Out (Melvin's Theme)"" is notable for its screwed, scratched beat, which sounds like the old East Coast-influenced West meets DJ Screw's Houston, a great hip hop cut. The gang are not without worldly awareness in ""Century Of The Self"" where they analyze the corrupt, selfish tendencies of human nature on earth. The Dilated Peoples have always been proponents of building mentally and expanding minds. They have always come original and never copied trends or tried to be something other than themselves. Directors Of Photography is all those things at once, and as a result, everyone wins.",1488067200,4

104750,16167,9299,"Joe Cocker, hailing from Sheffield, UK, released this song in 1974 as part of his album titled 'I Can Stand A Little Rain'. It is actually a cover tune as the original was released by Billy Preston. Comes to mind that an earlier hit of his, namely 'With A Little Help From My Friends', was originally done by the Beatles. Now, here is another example when Joe takes on someone else's song and raises it up to kingdom come. He left Billy Preston in the dust behind him. No one but Joe Cocker can put so much meaning, soul and emotion into a song, that is for certain. Most of us music lovers know that. There are several versions of this song, so I know.

104757,128,20133,"It's all about going into space for Kid Cudi on Satellite Flight, or so it would seem. Actually it is more likely a metaphor for taking us listeners into new, unexplored dimensions of thought, not new territory for the expansionist thinker Kid Cudi. The album is enveloped in Cudi's deep, uninterrupted singing voice with one rapping verse inserted in the thick of the album. It is quite the experimental pop/rnb affair, hardly a hip hop album to be correct. Cudi is in typical form lamenting, crowing, and going on in that jazzy, stylistic way of his about his mental separation from society. When he is not singing and besides the one rapping verse on the album, large swaths of intergalactic instrumentals mellow out the proceedings. Satellite Flight: The Journey To Mother Moon definitely has Kid Cudi's patented musical vibe even if it cannot be classified or critiqued as a rap album. Within the genre that Cudi has invented for himself, whatever the name, the album is a respectable one.",1488067200,2

104764,56,15878,"It has been a rough past few years for Rihanna. Musically, she has had more hits outside of her own album, Anti this past year. Her work on songs like Sledgehammer and This Is What You Came For, continue to show that her own album success firmly is not what it used to be a decade, largely because she overexposed her own brand in the way that Beyonce' Knowles had done as well. The past few years showed Rihanna doing more singles that really were not a part of what became Anti, and bigger hits than what she released from Anti, with the exception of Work. Her latest single, Love On The Brain, the fourth from Anti, shows Rihanna is trying to be more of a swooner in the way other legendary divas had shown in classic R&B like the legendary Whitney Houston and Aretha Franklin showcased. But Rihanna does not make the mark well, and sadly it is not the best on what she had n ballads for her songs. She showed it better when she teamed up with Ne-Yo on Hate That I Love You a decade ago. Perhaps when Rihanna does more ballads, she can swoon with a broader and more brilliant appeal than what she showed here.

However, I would rate several other Two Steps from Hell albums ahead of this one (including Classics 2), but that is only because other TSFH albums are so epic and amazing, not because this album is not good. This kind of music is perfect for just about anything. I enjoy listening while driving, studying, washing dishes, killing zombies, showering, etc. Two Steps from Hell has a piece for any situation or event I can think of. If you are a diehard TSFH fan, I would highly recommend buying this album asap. If you are new to TSFH or the ""epic music"" genre then I would recommend starting out with other albums from TSFH first such as Battlecry, Vanquish, or Invincible.

104772,128,5860,"50 Cent, Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo, and Young Buck of G-Unit are back once again, this time with The Beauty Of Independence EP, and they have a special talent to introduce, Kidd Kidd, who is new to their roster and label, G-Unit Records. The Beauty Of Independence is a great showing of solidarity from G-Unit, considering the fact that all four original members are on the EP. When nature dictates that groups tend to disband over time, this complete reunification is a feat in and of itself. The gang are essentially back to their old antics, and this consistency proves to be a fitting formula. The opener, ""Watch Me,"" brings listeners up to speed and establishes the current level of musicality with which the group is comfortable and proficient. It is gangsta through and through, and as an introduction to G-Unit in 2014, it screams to audiences everywhere, ""Here they are!"" The follow up track, ""I Don't F--- With You,"" is more real gangsterism over concert style cornets, giving way to ""Digital Scale,"" a track almost exclusively dedicated to the subject of drug dealing, a topic which is touched on again in ""The Plug."" Nowhere is this G-Unit crew more eloquent, however, than on ""Changes,"" where they discuss reversals of fortune and how nothing ever really remains the same over time. Overall the guys do a good job of being lyrical on a competitive level, and some nice, new territory is explored production-wise throughout.

They raise a family and then it starts all over again. Its pretty neat how he manages to get so many little bitty's in the song. Its a fast song and probably would be good for dancing the Texas two step. I really like Alan Jackson's songs because they are mostly old country.

Twelve Reasons To Die is not a very long collection of songs, but what it does offer will leave the listener tremendously satisfied. In other words, quality is more important than quantity here.

104782,128,8115,"Brooklyn, NY emcee and Slaughterhouse member Joell Ortiz, who was for a time signed to Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment record label, takes time to make mental connections and stew over issues in his third solo LP, House Slippers. In the album, he deals with how he has evolved with hip hop over the years, his having to overcome obstacles in and out of the music business, and even his recent weight loss and lifestyle change to increased physical fitness. Joell Ortiz is obviously in a healthy place in life, considering the fact that he is performing this self examination with a grateful attitude. He is still that creative, hard edged emcee who raps with advanced lyricism. And for every filler track on House Slippers, there are three or four intelligent tracks to make up for them. In other words, the bulk of the album is made up of smart material. Ortiz has invited some rappers and some singers to appear on House Slippers and has even brought his Slaughterhouse group mates (Royce Da 5'9'', Joe Budden, and Crooked I) into the studio for ""Brothers Keeper"" to show that besides being a rap quartet, they are also a family. The production is handled mainly by The Heatmakerz and gives the album a sparkling yet rugged sound. This time around, Joell Ortiz is a more self aware artist who spits fire on the mic over nice hip hop beats. House Slippers is a good addition to his growing body of work.",1488067200,3

104788,128,10087,"Of all the associates of the Wu-Tang Clan, none is perhaps more prolific or has a more decorated career than Killah Priest (real name Walter Reed, not to be confused with the U.S. Army physician). Appearing early on in tracks by original members of the Wu and the Gravediggaz (a RZA side project), Priest made his group debut with Wu's Sunz of Man posse and later joined The Four Horsemen (or HRSMN: Canibus, Ras Kass, Kurupt and Priest) and then the Black Market Militia. His 1998 solo debut Heavy Mental became an instant underground classic and was followed by 2000's View From Masada after which Priest was dropped by MCA Records. In the next ten years, Killah Priest would release seven more LPs and several mixtapes on various label imprints, despite getting the pink slip from MCA.

As the studio follow-up to The Psychic World of Walter Reed from 2013, the June 2015-released Planet of the Gods puts Killah Priest's spiritual and conspiratorial theories in a cosmic, intergalactic context and takes his listeners on an adventure through history and space guided by the rapper's fascinating belief system, one based largely on his Black Hebrew religious denomination. The album isn't a great tangent from the Brooklyn MC's typical music but features his standard mic excellence, his large and diverse knowledge, some new delivery styles and a fresh album concept which explores far reaches of the heavens.

The Priest's complex lyricism, one of his two most famous trademarks, is amazing and jaw-dropping as usual. His second most famous trademark, his thorough understanding and academic familiarity with mythic, primeval mysticism, takes on a slightly new form for Planet of the Gods. In ""Gods of E.din,"" he attempts to connect astronomy, astrology and celestial beings with the origins of human life and ancient religions, and in ""Golden Pineapple of the Sun,"" he applies his own unique handle to unexplained phenomena and other earthly machinations. Around the reoccurring themes of space, mythology and mystics, the rest is a mixed bag.

He preaches the vastness of the human mind and his own multitudinous rhyme powers in ""Creation of a Super God,"" a motivational trip for the psyche and a real fist pumper for the Priest himself. ""Mul.apin Tablets"" showcases the amicable interplay of a supposed scenario in which the first woman and man on earth create the world we live in today. It also traces a few of the secret, collusive events of human civilization up to the modern day, but so does pretty much every song on Planet of the Gods. The predominating belief that Killah Priest might be trying to spread is one of creationism over evolutionism (""Alien Stars""), but be warned that his belief skews significantly from the Christian Church's story of Adam and Eve.

In short, Killah Priest has done it (succeeded) again. Planet of the Gods is on an artistic parallel with nearly all his other albums, almost too much like them, but then again, since his abilities and intellect are so great, anything different would be inferior to his normal track record of greatness. Guest-less but not without a respectable set of beats, the LP boasts production from Black Marvel, Jordan River Banks and Ciph Barker mainly. Music elements include almost everything from electric rock to dance to world music. If there is one thing besides rap that Killah Priest does right, it's presenting intriguing, alternative ways of thinking. Those things and his otherworldly stories are sure to keep butts in the seats until the very end.",1488153600,4

104790,17676,9472,"Fantastic Son album.  Septeto Santiaguero with Dominican singer Jose Alberto absolutely destroy the drums' leather with a lot of upbeat songs, which is not surprising for an album titled, ""No quiero llanto"".  What makes this album stand out is having a very tight Son group that is open to many collaborations from outside artists, including not only Cuban musicians, but also other Latinamerican veterans like Oscar D'Leon and Andy Montanez.  Again, this is unsurprising given their success with their previous album ""Vamos pa' la fiesta"", which included numerous international collaborations.

The album pays tribute to the duo ""Los Compadres"" which was started in the 40s, but this doesn't sound dated or nostalgic in the slightest.  The twist halfway through El Lunar (which I won't ruin for you) would probably have been unthinkable just even 20 years ago.",1488153600,5

104793,128,20137,"Chattanooga, Tennessee native Isaiah Rashad has had a weathered journey so far in life. Raised mainly by his mother (his father left the family early), Rashad, whose full name is Isaiah Rashad McClain, was influenced by hip hop music most of his life. From listening to a host of different emcees growing up (Scarface, Too $hort, Outkast, Jay-Z and Snoop Dogg to name just a few), Rashad took it upon himself at a young age to nurture his own craft. His trials and travails include bouncing around recording studios, leaving school, networking with industry connects, touring with notables and turning down various record deals. In September 2013, Rashad signed with Top Dawg Entertainment, home to rap luminaries Kendrick Lamar, Ab-Soul, Schoolboy Q and Jay Rock (Black Hippy as a four-man group). He is the only rapper on the TDE roster not from Los Angeles. To consummate his relationship with his new label, Rashad released in January 2014 the Cilvia Demo EP, a generous slice of real life from a discoursed hip hopper born in the margins of American society.

In all, Cilvia Demo has a chill vibe, spotted with shaded melodies on the beats, the perfect backdrop for Isaiah Rashad's cooled, wary personality. With his flexible, seasoned rhyme flow, Rashad purges his pent-up frustrations and unleashes poignant social commentary on Black American culture, subliminally and with on-topic examples. Instead of complaining, Rashad isolates his problems and offers the proper attitude for them. He subtly advocates the value of self and diversity of thought because more than once on Cilvia Demo, Rashad rejects the opinions of others and the questionable, monolithic expectations of greater society. He is distraught but disciplined and determined enough to reject evil, street enough to fancy weed, women and money but smart enough to question everything people tell him. Through his ghetto lenses, Isaiah Rashad sees a less than friendly, sometimes treacherous landscape before him, but instead of scurrying nervously through it, he steadily strolls onward with style and an ounce of swagger.",1488153600,3

104795,128,1675,"The Watts, LA-raised, lyrical virtuoso Ras Kass, now over 18 years strong in the game, has banded with underground, boom-bap style producer Apollo Brown (Mello Music Group) for the Blasphemy LP. The Michigan-bred beat maker Brown has constructed a great set of productions that are just as complex and interesting as Ras Kass' lyrics are. As the title suggests, Blasphemy starts with Ras Kass making critical arguments against popular religions, especially Christianity, in ""How To Kill God."" He will continue in this questioning fashion for other tracks, like ""Deliver Us From Evil,"" where he discusses various historical violations of The Golden Rule. Although proclaiming himself a fallen angel, he boasts wisdom all over Blasphemy by preaching clean living (""Please Don't Let Me""), racial equality (""Strawberry"") and moral rules (""48 Laws Pt. 1""). As always though, Ras Kass still finds time to brag, strut and celebrate his gifts. His lyrical game is still sharp after all these years and so is his storytelling, as evidenced by ""Too Much Of A Good Thing"" and ""Francine,"" two songs about demons coming back to haunt mischievous women. Making the perfect beats to match the high caliber lyricism of Kass is no easy task. That's why Apollo Brown has combined eclectic samples, elegant instruments and East Coast style drum beats for a super nice audio event that can claim bits of orchestra, soul and r&b music within its mix.

Blasphemy contains three power-packed posse cuts, but with all the mighty guest verses on the album, they never seem to outshine Kass and his enormous lyrical prominence. Apollo Brown and Ras Kass are both respectful of the hip hop culture and the rap game, even if Kass is picking on industry giants one moment (""Humble Pi"") and saluting deceased legends the next (""Bon Voyage""). They make for a very compelling duo on the risky yet entertaining Blasphemy.",1488153600,3

104799,128,3546,"Maryland, let alone its Gaithersburg township, may not be a natural breeding ground for rap talent, but 2013 XXL Freshman, Logic, may soon be putting his locale on the map. The rapper and part time producer, who has been buzzing since his mixtape cascade began in 2010, seems to have his mind in the right place for Under Pressure, his studio debut. Executive produced by No ID and released by Def Jam and Visionary Music Group, Under Pressure boasts busy, luscious beats and a matured Logic confronting his rough past with a bright outlook on life. Logic starts the album with this positive tone and then delves into family stories and gets ambitious in the ""Soul Food"" two-parter. He covers a variety of topics throughout (girls, crime, movies, crew love, karma, etc.), but the most prominent and reoccurring of them include Logic's transition from a troubled, aimless childhood to mind- blowing music stardom and how it affects him and his family. Under Pressure's production as a whole captures several emotions and vibes, and it definitely has No ID's ambient beat making influence. A diverse array of producers including Visionary's 6ix and Logic himself supply rich electronic instruments and quick repeating hoots on more than one song. Logic proves himself a flavorful emcee, rapping at different speeds and cadences with a varying rhyme structure and awesome energy. He demonstrates multiple dimensions of creativity on tracks like ""Nikki,"" about a specific type of chemical dependency, and the title track ""Under Pressure,"" where he raps in the first person as his sister then father. The regular version of the album contains no guests but features Childish Gambino and Big Sean on two deluxe version bonus cuts. In the 12th track, ""Till The End,"" Logic recaps his rocky experiences in the music business and life in general but stays committed to keeping an optimistic attitude going forward. It is a fitting close to the album, where Logic shares his feelings and conveys again his project's chief mood. Firm, impactful and fun, Under Pressure shows a lot of promise for its author, who has a great mindset overall.",1488153600,3

104801,128,12599,"A member of Project Blowed, Thirsty Fish and Swim Team, rapper/singer Open Mike Eagle might have originated amongst the stringent, traditional milieus of Chicago, Illinois, but the loose, sunny surroundings of Los Angeles, California sure have expanded his horizons. His 2014 LP, Dark Comedy, courtesy of the Mello Music Group, is enlightened, cool, nerdy, experimental, sad and inquisitive. Mike alternates between singing and rapping, but his artistic, placid rapping is better, even though his singing is soothing and polished in its own right too. It shows he's multitalented, and in fact, it's a good combo for listeners. He is so deeply allegorical and knowledgeable that Dark Comedy requires a few listens for people's heads to wrap around it, but the other treats on the album make up for this. The whiny, electronic multipolarity of the slow, artsy music, Mike's moving emotion and skill, and some of the tropes and themes take some of the attention away from any hyper- intelligence there may be on the LP. Many of the attitudes seem to resemble or reflect those of the confused youth of the post-2008 recession era, and this subtle type of social commentary makes Dark Comedy a nice, timely keepsake. Open Mike Eagle is still a fairly young man here, but he sounds like a wise old man, in a good way. Dark Comedy may be an acquired taste, but more important, it's rich, exploratory ""art rap,"" as Mike calls it.",1488153600,4

In hip hop, Compton, California instrumentalist, producer, disc jockey, and rapper DJ Quik is one of those continuously exceptional artists who is legendary to his coast and hip hop as a whole. Producing and rapping since the eighties and playing instruments since a child, Quik, or David Blake, has assembled some of the most gorgeous funk and soul beats of all time and has always been an interesting emcee on the mic. He has worked with many figures in the biz from Tupac, Dr. Dre, and Ice Cube to his frequently recurring collaborators, AMG, 2nd II None, Hi-C, El DeBarge, Suga Free, and Playa Hamm, some of whom appear on Quik's ninth solo album, The Midnight Life. Quik of course infuses his signature funk and soul into the album but puts a different twist on them just for this collection of songs. Cool, original guitar, piano, and horns with strong drums and claps are layered upon each other for a rich, voluptuous audio experience from start to finish. Quik has added some talk boxing, an unusual instrument (by hip hop standards) in the second track, and a jaw dropping concept beat in ""Trapped On The Tracks."" His lyrics are again stimulating and diverse with rhymes, and in addition to the familiar guests are some new ones, Bishop Lamont, David Blake II, and Dom Kennedy. Quik runs the gamut of speaking topics from personal philosophy to natural social phenomena, but his main aim is to have a great time in the musical process. Amongst his various talking points, he hits upon the mark he has made on the game, the beauty of living fly, his seniority in hip hop, just deserts for promiscuous women, and relationship communication. DJ Quik has such appealing, easily identifiable style and flavor that are unique enough so as to require little maintenance over time except for the necessary experimentation for freshness and modern day relevancy. He has put all those things in The Midnight Life, so the new dawn for the Compton raised, music virtuoso looks very bright.",1488153600,4

104814,128,2701,"Rapper/singer Kevin Gates might have gotten off on the stardom of his XXL Freshman Class induction for 2014, enough to build steam and plow through two mixtapes (By Any Means and Luca Brasi 2) in that year, but a heavy lesson in careful, artistic execution of projects should well be learned by the Baton Rouge, Louisiana native. Having worked with fellow Baton Rouge natives, rappers Lil Boosie (now Boosie Badazz) and Webbie, Kevin Gates has a sound and style that has no doubt been influenced by the two. A little bit of Lil Wayne essence can also be detected, at least at the opening of Luca Brasi 2, and this is no shocker. Weezy's Young Money helped manage Gates at one point but never signed him. That pleasure goes to Atlantic, who picked up Gates around early 2013. You can probably tell from the title that Luca Brasi 2 is heavy on the mafia/crime mob imagery and references. Kevin Gates paints himself as a rich, callous drug czar to mythic proportions, very much like a fairy tale or charade. The radio-friendly pop of the beats and Gates' light approach and occasional humor keep Luca Brasi 2 from drowning in the seriousness of the black market underworld on which his content speaks. DJ Drama hosts, and it's pretty long (just over an hour) but the decent trap beats and Gates' liquid stream of rhymes make Luca Brasi 2 just easy enough to endure. Technically, Gates is a swift, fluid flow-rider. His vocabulary is weak though, and his narrow interest in everything gangsta is frustrating. No where does Gates switch up his cadence and delivery pattern so this mixtape may have the unintended consequence of acting as a sleep inducer, sending listeners to slumber or other planes of thought instead of focusing on the lyrics. Guests on the album include August Alsina, Boobie Black, Rico Love, K Camp and Rich Homie Quan. Luca Brasi 2 is a poor mixtape that ultimately drones on for sixty-three minutes of gangsterism.",1488153600,1

104816,128,7791,"A little past the due date, this review serves to put the spotlight back on a shining beacon of an album, March On Washington. Released in October 2014 by hip hop trio Diamond District (producer Oddisee and emcees yU and Uptown XO) under Mello Music Group, March On Washington just might be the perfect album to reserve for February, Black History Month, to review. Although it doesn't explicitly make race an issue, this crystalline-bright LP, inspired by the event during which Martin Luther King Jr. made his famous I Have A Dream speech, has a sense of vigor and urgency that mimic the 1963 civil rights gathering which it is named after. When the three artists on the album wear their Black pride on their sleeves however, they do so with a good measure of modesty. Boiled down, March On Washington is simply amazing music for all people, irrespective of skin tone. You could listen to this beautiful album a dozen times and still need more plays to capture and appreciate all the gifts it intends to bestow upon its listeners. It's that good.

Oddisee, yU and XO hail from the Washington DC area, or the DMV (DC, Maryland and Virginia) as some call it. They're not shy about representing their area with pride, but they're also not obsessed with the practice either thankfully. March On Washington is basically a clarion call to live healthfully. The album's wisdom easily takes the cake, and this wisdom is not the boring, snooze-inducing type but the cool, useful, knowledge-based sort aided of course by a preponderance of superlative rap flows by yU and XO. Each stanza flourishes with excellent lyrical rhymes and undisturbed thoughts on everyday life. Areas explored include the differences among people, critique of the mainstream and lots of bubbly, effervescent proverbs. Diamond District wish to share their preternatural skill, talent and ways of thinking, and the richness and captivating nature of March On Washington prove the group's success to this end. The album is smart but also fun, never losing its lyrical weightiness. The ride is smooth yet hypnotic, as everything rests comfortably on Oddisee's soul-drenched samples and crisp drum set beats. Look out for a few surprises like ""Working Weekends""' squeaky, chirpy alt. sounds. The variety they provide will come in handy.

Although only their second album as a group following 2009's In The Ruff, Diamond District have the hip hop heart and substance to make them instant breakout hit makers. Each of the three members are proving themselves singly with outside projects, but together they might be even more special. March On Washington is exciting and philosophical, with lots of slow-bopping replay value that is street tested and boom-bap approved.",1488153600,4
104817,1108,16857,"Despite not being a huge Barenaked Ladies fan (the only other songs of their's I listen to on a regular basis are ""One Week"" and their version of ""God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen""), I really enjoy this song.  It's an upbeat yet mellow acoustic number that's funny and adorable, with some hilarious speech interludes that seem entirely unscripted and are all the funnier for this.  In fact, much of this song feels off the cuff and impromptu, though not in a bad way -- the seeming improvisation just makes it even more enjoyable.

I'll definitely be listening to more by this band, as both this song and ""One Week"" prove that they're an oddball but highly enjoyable group.",1488153600,5
104818,128,10586,"Aesop Rock, the man with the largest vocabulary in hip hop (or so states New York data scientist Matt Daniels), has returned with emcee Rob Sonic and DJ Big Wiz (who combined make up the group Hail Mary Mallon) for Bestiary, the trio's second LP. Released by Rhymesayers Entertainment, the same label that released HHM's first LP, Are You Gonna Eat That?, Bestiary contains a more digestible form of its fore- album's bizarre, complex lyricism of wacky, oddball imagery and situations. Aesop Rock and Rob Sonic are unruly, aimless badasses, rapping all over the place and in all directions. With their ill rhyme styles, they explore the nature and philosophy of life and death, and their wild, artful rapping accurately mimics the chaos of the world. Taking its name from the word meaning a written account of real and fantasy animals, Bestiary contains some animal imagery but just lots of other imagery too, like art gallery-scale imagery. Despite all the craziness and a few dark undertones, there is a sense of purpose, hope and levity in Bestiary thanks to the ""fund raiser concert"" skits and their do-it-yourself subtext. Coupled with the intelligent, left field lyrics, the samples, scratches, diverse synths and hard rocking drums make Bestiary a truly eccentric specimen of underground, alternative hip hop. It marks a new level of comfort for Hail Mary Mallon that just might prove comforting to audiences as well.",1488153600,3

104822,128,20140,"Leimert Park, LA's Dom Kennedy (Dominic Hunn), who is unlike some other budding emcees from the West Coast, namely Earl Sweatshirt, Vince Staples and Fashawn but others as well, is not afraid to admit he enjoys the fruits of his labor or the finer things in life, and with an obligation to incorporate brainwork in his verses, his chill, Cali style is about more than the stereotypes of highlife-rap. In his third studio album, the phlegmatic Kennedy (an admirer of Robert Francis Kennedy; see 2009's Best After Bobby mixtape) unrolls more laid-back lyricism marking his cool, clam days and times over placid beats of a Westside, electro-soul orientation. Though he frequently expresses his love for fancy cars, pretty ladies, designer watches and the latest sneakers on By Dom Kennedy, his practical sense does come through in a few spots. Dom name-drops some of the greats of the rap game in a show of respect, and his self-embodied ambition is ubiquitous. He assumes the role of the family provider on the metaphorical ""Lemonade,"" and he questions all the expensive trips and things in ""Alhambra"" before finishing the song with the line, ""in the long run, what does it really matter?"" By Dom Kennedy is stable, and while shorter than his over-an-hour Get Home Safely sophomore, in all it's damn good riding music that fits the bill. The smooth rolling beats are a little basic, and Bonic of Philly's Most Wanted and Tish Hyman (uncredited) serve as the only guests; however, nothing those guests or the producers have contributed is shoddy or half-assed. Dom's third LP is another mostly strong link in his chain of albums, a mellow testimonial of a regular guy from Southern California.",1488153600,3
104823,128,20141,"With two critically acclaimed, commercially successful studio albums to his name, it only makes sense that Roc Nation-signed emcee/producer J. Cole would form his very own record label and sign some of his talented friends to it. Dreamville/Interscope now has a moderately sized stable of rappers and producers including the slick rhyming Bas out of Queens, New York. Before he dropped his studio debut, Last Winter, Bas gained a following with mixtapes, guest features and his Two Weeks Notice EP, good experience before plunging into heavy commercial stardom. In Last Winter, a focused Bas enjoys the spoils of victory while navigating some confounding social circumstances, all the while keeping a mentality hell-bent on success. It is an affair that primarily revolves around women, fame, money, traveling abroad, good weed, and drink. Bas is stylish and surprisingly debonair with a unique vernacular and drawl when he is unwinding his calm, creative rhyme flow. He loves to have fun but knows it comes at a price. As bedding for Bas's original voice, an assortment of syncopated, synth beats with groovy jazz inserts give Last Winter a solid foundation upon which to rest. The producers include a few Dreamville in-house mates and a few outside invitees, and Bas keeps the guest list minimal aside from K-Quick, Jermaine Cole himself, Irvin Washington and Mack Wilds. Except for a few stereotypes and some run-of-the-mill hangout ballads (both of which are not frequent or overbearing), Last Winter is a pretty fresh piece of artwork.",1488153600,3
104824,128,1266,"Far removed is Houston rapper Paul Wall from his glory days of record label-promoting and genre-defining collaborations with fellow Houston rapper Chamillionaire, who teamed up with Wall in the late 1990s to form The Color Changin' Click before disbanding around 2005. A viable Southern hustling emcee of yesteryear, Paul Wall has made contributions to hip-hop through his records with the Swishahouse label and most recently with Paul Wall Music. Wall's seventh LP, The Po-Up Poet, is more material of Wall's archetypal style, filled with notions of weed, money, cars, ladies, jewelry and lots of ""drank."" Never one to blow minds with advanced lyricism, Paul Wall has historically received regards for his raps of steady rhyming, and this same modus operandi is applied faithfully by Wall in Po-Up. He is still that same on-the-grind hustler with expensive tastes, focused on staying on his toes and having fun in between time. Worthy of notable mention are the tracks ""No Favors,"" a lesson in self-reliance, and ""Codeine Heartbreak,"" where Wall discusses his love/hate relationship with extra strength, prescription cough syrup. The guest line-up is predictable, offering up verses of Dirty South flavor, especially from Screwed Up Click rapper Z-Ro, who appears twice on the album. The electronic trap beats match all of Wall's objectives and while formulaic, they are just original enough to be tolerable. At this point in Wall's career, The Po-Up Poet is a subpar effort, only attractive to die hard Paul Wall obsessives.",1488153600,1

104826,128,8719,"A group seven years in the making, Brooklyn to Milwaukee connection eMC, Masta Ace, Wordsworth and Stricklin, with Punchline up until his late 2014 departure, were record collaboration partners before uniting as an official crew thanks to the encouragement of fans on internet message boards. Pairings of the members appeared on Juice Crew legend Masta Ace's 2001 album Disposable Arts and 2004's A Long Hot Summer, and in 2008 the four released their first collective LP, The Show. Following The Show's critical underground success, they left the scene for six years, returning in 2014 with the solid Turning Point EP. In capitalizing off their recent comeback velocity, the former quartet now a trio are back with an LP, their second, called The Tonite Show, not to be confused with Freddie Gibbs' 2014 EP of the same name.

The songs on the album, which follow no particular storyline, are arranged around a series of skits that document a bad day in which eMC are snubbed from an appearance on a farcical Tonight Show, ""The Tonite Show starring Jimmy Falcon."" They're playful and sprinkled with a smattering of light humor, even if they're a bit cumbersome and annoying to experience at parts. The actual songs find the emcees either hitting or missing the mark lyrically, sometimes putting on a smart, complex rhyme-show and other times laying back not trying extremely hard with their lines. Laid out on the table are numerous put-downs and critiques of rivals and male groupies (eMC call them ""moopies"") plus the group's experience with lovely crushes but also dysfunctional relationships, not delicious grub for heads to chomp on but possibly all the guys could come up with in less than one year's time.

A low-key showing of guests including emcees B-Real, Xzibit and Sadat X lend variety and Rosie Perez, Timoor Anunnaki, and comedians Tony Rock (younger brother of comedian Chris Rock) and Russell Peters serve as the guests and host of The Tonite Show. To make matters more mundane, the old style beats, provided by a group of B-List producers, are straight out of a poppy, outdated r&b playbook. It can be argued that The Tonite Show was rushed and is mainly the desire to cash in on the hopes of old curious fans, but it's better than nothing as further holdout from the group could have given us no product at all. The absence of Punchline hurts but doesn't debilitate, and while Masta Ace, Wordsworth and Stricklin are all still fantastic in their own individual respects, the great group dynamic and chemistry they once had might unfortunately be unreproducible at this point.",1488153600,2
104827,128,12916,"At this point, Grand Daddy I.U.'s career can be divided into two periods, his pre-retirement beginnings (1989-1995) and his post-retirement comeback (2007-present). The former Cold Chillin' Records artist and Hempstead, New York native rubbed elbows with some of the most major players in hip hop (Biz Markie, Roxanne Shante, Big L, Positive K and others) and released two LPs in the early 1990s (Smooth Assassin and Lead Pipe). His comeback has mostly been solid, starting with 2007's Stick To The Script album, but seems to be getting stale and stagnant with 2015's P.I.M.P. (Paper Is My Priority). The good thing is he still has his active style of rhyme over the cool breezy funk of the classic hip-hop beats in P.I.M.P., but the lyrical concepts herein are simply not fresh, putrid at times. It's understandable that he's out to get paid, but the pimping vehicle to get it is terribly painful at this point. P.I.M.P. (Paper Is My Priority) is a questionable work from an old schooler who unfortunately does not know how or refuses to stay relevant in our modern rap landscape.",1488153600,1

Having produced for Blueprint in Soul Position and Copywrite, Tage Future, Jakki Da Motamouth and Camu Tao in MHz Legacy, RJD2 (Ramble Jon Krohn) has been around the block, and on STS x RJD2, he guides and fosters STS's self-development with all his past care and seriousness. Before making his own move to Philadelphia, STS rested his head in Atlanta, developing an appreciation for hip hop through wide eyed Southern lenses. With an evident Andre 3000-like flow, STS quotes and name-drops some of his other rap inspirations (Jay-Z, A Tribe Called Quest, Pete Rock & CL Smooth) and isn't afraid to rap his mind. No matter if he is reminiscing on his grandma's mom- and-pop rib shack, shouting out Mary Jane and Jack Daniels, or playing the love skeptic, one thing remains a constant, his hardwired ATL/Philly representation. Whether rapping upright and on topic or spitting rhyme-nebulas about problems coming up, inner demons and karma, STS's flow and style, like the RJD2 beats he is paired with, embody essences of both soulful, smooth Georgia and the hard, knocking Northeast. Besides his right hand producer, Sugar Tongue is joined only by soul singer Amos Lee, meaning he can singlehandedly support the vocal side of the LP.

104833,128,8754,"As optimistic as they've ever been, Kentucky's Nappy Roots talk themselves into staying positive by plainly stating such in The 40 Akerz Project, their sixth album overall. A modification of the original group (R. Prophet and Big V left in 2006 and 2012) and currently made up of Skinny DeVille, Fish Scales, B. Stille and Ron Clutch, Nappy Roots still feel the need to regularly spit nuggets of wisdom (a wedge cliched by now) but without a great deal of lyrical range on 40 Akerz. They modestly help themselves to safe amounts of weed and booze, warn us where we might end up if we drink too much in ""Ditch"" and cast out the ""propaganda"" of our media-drenched, workaday world; however, like the beats, the guys keep their rhyme lines basic and unimaginative. SMKA and most notably 808 Blake, a de facto Nappy bandmate at present, supply the beats that are strictly of the electro- synth universe and cut with popular r&b music hooks. Even the modern Drill craze seeps into the drum sounds of tracks ""No Idea,"" ""Call The Cops"" and ""Feelin' Like."" With zero guests except for the interviewer in their four skits, this latest Nappy project feels empty and in want of more. The saving grace is the crew's healthy mindset and the rosy glow in their attitudes which remind us why the Nappy Roots have come to be seen as venerable, Southern prophets over the years.",1488153600,2

Rest assured he's still appreciative of Wiz, who is one of many guests on 20 Lights and who contributes a rap verse on the song ""OT."" In other words, Berner does rep his set, if not a few others as well. On this EP, Berner is a proficient rhymer who has committed his talents to the categories of pot- smoking, women-chasing and high stakes music ventures. It's a relief that Berner is not very deep into the drug dealing sub-sect of hip hop, but it's questionable how lucrative he says his wealth is. You won't find the textbook definition of gangster rap on 20 Lights, and more often than not, the music is a product of formula as opposed to experimentation. In addition to Wiz, The Jacka, Curren$y, Smiggz, Mac Dre, Migos and Ampichino all appear on the CD. It's a whopping load of features for seven tracks, but Berner still manages to get his breathing room. The beats have a few samples, like Pat Benatar's ""Love Is A Battlefield"" on ""Breathe/Dreaming,"" but they mostly house EDM and bass and synth ear- candy. The entrepreneurial Berner shows lyrical promise and a knack for pleasing on 20 Lights, and although he specializes in gaieties that are not explicitly illegal or criminal, it would have been nice to hear him engage in something other than the jocularities of a rap tycoon.",1488153600,2

104839,128,20142,"Blurring the lines between quick-spat hip hop and the funky soul of his inner jazzman, Berkley, California-raised, Japanese American musician Lyrics Born always listens to his heart first in approaching projects. Integral to hip hop collective/record label Quannum Projects and rap duo Latyrx with emcee Lateef The Truthspeaker, Lyrics Born has the reputation of having a swift tongue and vast, versatile vocabulary on the mic plus a knack for poppy funk in his perky production style. Having made four previous LPs teasing his love for swanky soul, he finally pulled the trigger and made a pilgrimage to the Mecca of Southern jazz and funk, New Orleans, Louisiana, to collaborate with some of the city's best for his eighth album overall, Real People (Mobile Home Recordings).

Produced by Robert Mercurio and Ben Ellman of NOLA-based Galactic jazz crew, the album doesn't stop with those two for its organic, new- age funk sound. Ivan Neville (son of Aaron Neville), David Shaw, Corey Henry, Trombone Shorty, Corey Glover and members of the Preservation Hall Jazz Band are just some of the other talents that bless Real People and work live, whole instrumentation into the album.

Lyrics Born balances his time between singing and emceeing mostly well, unfortunately putting less emphasis on what most fans love him for and what he is historically best at, rapping. Emotionally swaying with a firm grip on life and always fun and smart, he is at different times content, braggadocious, freewheeling, irked and cunning. He revisits his childhood in ""Real People"" and insinuates he's 'the man' in ""$ir Racha"" then quickly enters the game of love with a cluster of songs praising her majesty, falling head over heels in infatuation, venting on a pestering mother-in-law and eventually settling down with the one he loves.

The close is most concerned with life complaints, power lyrics and socking it to loose-lipped gossipers, topic-jumping within songs very irregularly. Lyrics Born brings some fresh new concepts to Real People and needless to say a lot of great new collaborators. Together they've recorded music that is partly inspired by the Mardi Gras bandstand but way more polished and professional, adding soul, jazz, funk and boogie, courtesy of NOLA's brightest, best trained musicians. He once said that he always felt like any other ordinary person growing up, but with Real People, Lyrics Born might feel a slight change of fortune and a warm sense of self worth from now on.",1488153600,3

104841,128,5451,"50 Cent's flagship team, G-Unit, is back after releasing 2014's The Beauty Of Independence EP, the group's first release since 2008's Terminate On Sight LP. Ironically, 50 hardly even appears on this The Beast Is G-Unit EP, aside from one: a wooing autotune bit opening the introductory ""Ballin,"" and two: the chorus of ""Boy Boy."" G-Unit's six year hiatus proved their best marketing tool for The Beauty Of Independence, which overall performed well. The guys were gallantly back on their gangsta schtick with some renewed and newfound spirit. The same is true for The Beast Is G-Unit, except this one suffers the fate of coming after Beauty.

In relation to before, the repetition in content includes the gangsterism, pimping, worship of big boy toys, and various other infractions of the law that the five-piece crew commit on this round's excursion. The mostly-complete gang of Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo, Young Buck and Kidd Kidd (50 Cent barely contributes) are satisfactorily lyrical for the most part, relegating their gifts to street life matters and proving to fans that they can still band-up after all these years. Notwithstanding that fact, Lloyd Banks, out of all the members, gives the EP the brightest signs of lyrical virtuosity, throwing in different rhythms and tempos and basically just showing the most free-spirited character of any in the bunch.

Aside from needing to be there and appealing to a new class of hip hop listeners, the beats walk a thin line between relevancy and redundancy, harnessing the nervous, temporal energy of drill- ticks and a few sounds from G-Unit's past, i.e., organ, wavering electric guitar and ringing piano. Although The Beast Is G-Unit is lyrically on par with anything from the group's past, it still remains skimpy on intelligent, advanced art, making the biggest impact by being stunning, shocking and thrilling as opposed to the aesthetic of being fascinating and intriguing from an intellectual standpoint.",1488153600,3

As a part of the hip hop trio Cutthroat Boyz, a signee to multiple record labels, and a much buzzed-about ghetto philosopher, Long Beach, CA emcee Vince Staples has a lot of artistic potential, a lot of hype to his name, and a blazing spirit that remains unmatched in the game. Although his list of collaboration partners is considerable, Staples has chosen to keep his debut EP, Hell Can Wait, more or less a singular affair. A small handful of producers (Hagler, No ID, Infamous, and Anthony Kilhoffer) impressively match original, industrial beats to Staples' rich vocals. Melodic stretches are injected into the EP at just the right moments but more than a little bit of the album is marked by coarse, electronic sounds, very slightly reminiscent of G-funk. Vince Staples is a fabulous storyteller, informing listeners of ghetto violence, police brutality, drug selling, dirty money making, and maleficent women in a detailed, pensive type of recollection. His flow is mindfully unfurled with great rhymes, good timing and sound coherence. The skills that Staples has are obvious. He uses just enough rhymes at appropriate tempos to convey his thoughts and get his point across. Staples needs no embellishments or exaggerations to reach his goals. The ghetto he knows is a wild wilderness, an untamed jungle where anything can and does happen. Hell Can Wait is Vince Staples coming to terms with his chaotic home and candidly admitting to his less than innocent role in it.",1488153600,3

The proficient, dexterous youngster, Bishop Nehru, who aside from emceeing and producing has tried his hand at music video editing and directing, has learned, adapted and shined through with the tools that the experienced emcee/producer MF Doom has handed him. Their collaborative album, NehruvianDOOM, blends crafty lyrics from Nehru, eclectically made beats by Doom, and an optimistic tone from the two artists combined. Considering his youth and scant years in the industry, Bishop Nehru surprisingly has a very clear, confident perspective on life, an unclouded vision, and a maturity that surpasses his years. In the face of others' jealousy and envy, he lays out his philosophy with strength in his delivery. Although Bishop Nehru mentions having to adjust to a dog eat dog world on ""Caskets"" (MF Doom provides a rap verse on that song), he counters this stark tone with words of love on ""Mean The Most."" Ultimately, NehruvianDOOM would not sound as unique as it does if not for MF Doom's multifaceted production skills. Doom layers light and heavy sounds on top of each other and characteristically inserts obscure sound bytes to reinforce the album's mission. Bishop Nehru embraces his youth for the time being, but he also proves to be a threatening contender to his emcee peers. The youthful smarts in Nehru's skillful lyrics plus Doom's very special beats make NehruvianDOOM a fresh, underground treat.",1488153600,4

104847,128,20144,"With the minor feud between Meek Mill and Wale rumored to be cooled down and new albums slated to be released in the near future from each of Rick Ross and the two aforementioned rappers, things are currently looking up or Maybach Music Group (MMG). To brighten up these rosy realities for Double-M.G., label mate Stalley (Kyle Myricks) has just released his debut solo LP, Ohio, which is of course named after his home state. True to his roots, musical influences and the MMG code, Stalley has filled Ohio with enough hustlin', stuntin' and Midwestern hoo- ridin' so that fans can easily recognize his brand and affiliations. His fluid flow is sufficiently varied in style and vocabulary, and the different inflections of his tone of voice give his rapping an animated, non-mechanized feel. Stalley discusses his hard times coming up in life but also mellows out by indulging in the club scene, lady loves, fashion and cars, particularly the sporty, high-performance type. Speaking of cars, Stalley has created an intriguing interpolation/remake of Eazy-E's ""Boyz-N-The- Hood"" single, called ""Jackin' Chevys,"" about getting it on in hot, stolen cars. Ohio is a relatively singular affair for Stalley except for guest appearances by Nipsey Hussle, Rick Ross, August Alsina, Ty Dolla Sign and Rashad, who produced much of the album's music. As a pleasant surprise, Stalley has also brought legends De La Soul out of retirement to spit a few bits of wisdom for listeners on ""Navajo Rugs."" The productions contain some real instruments and original beat loops but several sound like recreations of trap/drill standards, not necessarily a bad thing considering the album as a whole has a very unique, distinct sound beneath the lyrics. The most important fact to note about Ohio is that Stalley has not fully fallen prey to commercial, music market appetites. Instead, he has mixed up his content and style with new concepts and fresh rhymes and music, making for a solid enough solo debut.",1488153600,2
104848,128,6401,"Ever since Juicy J left Three 6 Mafia for Wiz Khalifa's Taylor Gang, things naturally haven't been the same for the Memphis, Tennessee horrorcore group. It also didn't help that Lord Infamous died of a heart attack and Gangsta Boo took off after recording began for Watch What U Wish... by Da Mafia 6ix reincarnation of Three 6 Mafia, spearheaded by DJ Paul for Scale-A-Ton Records. Although it suffers from the member drop-out (Juicy J is absent and Gangsta Boo is supplanted by La Chat), Lord Infamous (in sort of a tribute) is featured on several tracks, all the old energy is back, it's boosted by original members Koopsta Knicca and Crunchy Black, and it features likeminded guests Fiend, Locodunit, Billy Wes, Wacy Loco, Mariah Jane, Lil Wyte, Insane Clown Posse and Lil Infamous, Lord Infamous' son.

Severe gangsterism, threats of violence, weed-puffing, explicit sex and other twisted wheelings-and-dealings make up the insides of this bland horrorcore throwback. DJ Paul puts faint drill with Halloween-appropriate music for the traditional Three 6 Mafia sound with a modern update. It works for most of the one hour and eighteen minutes or until you get the message. Gone are the old rock-'em-sock-'em days of the full, original cast spinning wild ghetto stories, and after seven years since the last Three 6 album, Last 2 Walk (2008), the style is that much harder to pull off. If you just want a raucous, ghettoized roller coaster ride on wax, then Watch What U Wish... will surely foot the bill; however, don't look for extraordinary lyricism or other concepts that are uncharacteristic of the group.",1488153600,1

104850,2674,16882,"Another good but inconsistent album by Parquet Courts that leaves me a bit frustrated. There are times when this band sounds great, like a top notch outfit, but at other times, they slip into mediocrity and frustrate me.

Most of the other reviews give you a good gist of what this band sounds like. You can hear plenty of Velvet Underground influence, a bit of Pavement, and I also hear a healthy dose of old Dream Syndicate in some songs. Obviously, those are some very good influences. But Parquet Courts also have this maddening tendency to talk-rap in some of the songs, as if they are just too lazy to actually sing the song. The lead singer has a decent enough voice, so I don't know why they do this so often. Other than those infrequent musical hiccups, there are some powerful, riveting songs on this latest effort. I'm just waiting for this band to really show what they are capable of and give us a truly great album. This isn't quite the one.",1488153600,4
104851,128,879,"As a Mississippian, Def Jam artist and XXL Freshman from 2011, the King Remembered In Time, or Big K.R.I.T., has come a long way in the five years preceding his cosmic 2014 sophomore Cadillactica. Four highly regarded mixtapes of Southern flair and wisdom have done more than create a buzz for K.R.I.T., and his 2012 studio debut, Live From The Underground, secured his position as one of The Dirty's top rap prophets of the new era.

This Cadillactica LP is a full examination of god, life, love and pain from K.R.I.T.'s unique perspective in which he explores many topics. He places great weight on the love and cohesion of family when he laments about the anguish of broken, disconnected families in ""Soul Food."" Additionally, his gentlemanly side comes out in ""Pay Attention"" and ""Third Eye"" where he raps about fine, refined ladies. K.R.I.T.'s planet of abstract thought, or what he calls his Cadillactica, is a serene, confident mind state that makes obvious the name of his favorite make of town car. Cadillac imagery pops up in ""Cadillactica"" and the allegorical ""Do You Love Me For Real"" about the love that a man has for his woman and his ride. Toward the end of the album, he gets critical of music industry trends and encourages having an open mind. At various points, K.R.I.T. takes the liberty of jumping around with subject matter but remains logical and makes everything come together as relatable under the same roof. He has a refreshing fighting spirit of hopefulness that appropriately remedies the sadness and adversity in his surroundings. At the same time he is exceptionally lyrical, poetic and metaphorical with his swaggering flow. Because of his brainy, philosophical rumination, one might think the man too soft, but the moments where he gets tough and vicious instantly invalidate that idea.

Big K.R.I.T. has produced some of the album, but he has also invited several other producers to give Cadillactica a very original musical vibe. Perhaps not as sample heavy as some of his mixtapes, Cadillactica contains fresh synths, throwback loops, an 808-style bass line or two, and other funky instruments like the jazzy, muted trumpet in ""Mo Better Cool,"" which also contains hip, danceable, drum taps. All the sounds light up the album like stars in a night sky. Several talented singers and rappers contribute verses but never asphyxiate K.R.I.T.'s artistic expression.

Cadillactica is a colorful, comprehensive mosaic of musical influences. It's not hard to identify the different rappers who K.R.I.T. has drawn from for his style, but rest assured, his is a unique, one of a kind style that can hold up on its own. As the title to the seventh track suggests, K.R.I.T. is a rising king of the South who is giving other South stars like T.I. and Lil Wayne a run for the money. His talent and exuberance in Cadillactica make for an album that will have a special place in the hearts of fans ""4eva.""",1488153600,4

104853,128,6863,"Alternative, conscious hip hop can be approached from many angles, which is why it's glaring when styles are reused without expounding on, extrapolating from or offering solutions to the source issues. In the Words Paint Pictures EP, Rapper Big Pooh (of Durham, North Carolina trio Little Brother fame) and Detroit producer Apollo Brown have come together with the spirit of Mello Music Group to once again describe what they feel are the most exigent problems in society now, namely police-on-black violence, federal government wrongdoing and the prison industrial complex as a second ghetto for blacks.

All of those moving parts, which blossom from Pooh's golden rapping voice box, play out to the backdrop of Brown's sample-based soul beats, which are nice as always but show little innovative growth and bring to life few new ideas or techniques, just nice new samples. Give him some time though. Brown's a good beat maker.

Words Paint Pictures is regrettably a little one dimensional, and Big Pooh makes hay of a racially beleaguered America, even if his critique on the public sector with Ras Kass is excellent. After ""Promise Land,"" the EP settles into fresh rhymes and cold chillin'. There are nine songs total, but the last two are remixes leaving seven ""originals."" Other guests besides Ras Kass include Steve Roxx, Eric ""Blakk Soul"" Keith, Marv Won, L'Orange and an awesomely lyrical triplet of Jalen Santoy, Novej and Lute in ""Kings.""

It would have been nice to hear Big Pooh suggest curative measures of conduct to combat the flaws of our current social order and system, but his questioning mentality and healthy skepticism are appreciated nonetheless. Likewise, Apollo Brown simply rolls out his music loops rarely with a surprise moment in the fold, but even if it is within a familiar comfort zone that he produces, the beats still possess harmonious, throwback beauty.",1488153600,3

104864,128,7787,"Suffolk, VA emcee Kenn Starr may share his name with the former independent counsel who investigated the Bill Clinton/Monica Lewinsky affair, but really the two men are quite dissimilar vocationally and with regards to some of their ideologies. Kenn, the rapper, has kept a low profile since dropping his first LP, Starr Status, nine years ago under Halftooth Records. Since 2006, he has released only two compilation mixtapes on top of that debut. Recently, he signed with the rising Mello Music Group and just released his second LP, Square One. Like Starr Status, Square One includes several beats by Kenn's Low Budget Crew bandmate Kev Brown. Three are produced by Detroit's Black Milk, and the rest by 14KT, Roddy Rod and Kaimbr. Missing are beats by Low Budget Crew member Oddisee, now also an artist of Mello Music, but this translates to a new direction in sound attributed to the handiwork of Square One's different yet exceptional cast of producers. There is a lot of great sampling as this is basically a nice lineup of backpacker beats that are soulful, punchy and chill all at the same time. In his casual flow of dope lyrics, Kenn opens his verbal floodgates, letting out streams of social relevance and philosophy. What makes a big impression are his interesting, opening monologues about living modestly and struggling as a rapper in today's music business. Later on, he touches on relationship fluctuations and talks about leaving a legacy in life. Overall, there's a wide-enough variety of subject material. One must also not dismiss the strong, super creative lyricism from all of Kenn Starr's guests. They are Sean Born, Melanie Rutherford, Boog Brown, yU, Hassaan Mackey, Wordsworth and Supastition. Square One is a solid return to hit-making by Kenn Starr. The beats have some great throwback value, and the rhymes are tight and on point as usual.",1488153600,3

104867,128,10231,"In much the same way that Run The Jewels with El-P and Killer Mike joined two pretty humongous, previously unassociated rap camps for a detour into cruel punk rap songs, Czarface (Wu-Tang Clan's Inspectah Deck with Boston's 7L & Esoteric) are putting their unique spin on the genre with a personality and mike-disposition nearly identical to RTJ's. Their self titled Czarface debut became an instant underground smash in 2013 and revealed that the Rebel INS plus 7L & Eso mix very well with each other.

Their second official release, Every Hero Needs A Villain, is almost a mirror-image of their first, save for a new set of guests (Method Man, Large Professor, Juju of The Beatnuts, GZA, MF Doom, Meyhem Lauren, R.A. the Rugged Man) and all- original rhyme verses in each track of course. In any case, EHNAV is a strong album sustained by epic, raw lyrics and more of 7L and Spada4's industrial and grunge rock-inspired alternative beats. Ambitious on both its vocal and instrumental fronts, the album's main concerns are to appall (with coarse, sometimes violent imagery), impress (with dizzying, nonstop rhyme schemes) and exhilarate (with artsy, indie, experimental production), and by all intensive purposes, they've more or less reached their goal.

Despite having few social implications or a variety of concepts (it truly has only one), EHNAV flourishes by being a rich greenhouse of thriving hip hop excitement, a wild comicbook-like rap album. The most important meaning behind this project however is its continuation of healthy collaboration between two rap acts from substantially different backgrounds, Inspectah Deck from the rough and tumble Staten Island, New York and producer/emcee team 7L & Esoteric from the more congenial backdrops of Boston, Massachusetts. Both have overlooked some of their cultural disparities to commune on their shared love for hip-hop.",1488153600,3
104868,128,4545,"It's a relief that Funk Volume founder and rapper Hopsin was joking about retiring from rap because his record label seems to be growing stronger with each passing month. Decatur, Georgia emcee Jarren Benton is one of a handful of quality lyricists on Funk Volume, and his latest release, an EP titled Slow Motion Volume One, is proving Benton is the real deal behind the mic, no gimmicky underground fad. He has dedicated the album to his late manager and friend, Jahmal ""Slow Motion"" Pryor, who passed away in 2013. In fact, the last track ""Silence,"" featuring Sareena Dominguez, acts as a moving eulogy to his past partner. Like his debut LP, My Grandma's Basement (2013), Benton's heart and soul are more than felt on Slow Motion One. Equipped with colorful comparisons and similes, the relentless, deranged Benton spits lively lyrics of graphic rhymes, smartly conceived and sharply executed. Handling topics such as destiny, greatness, perseverance and the race against time, Benton is more of a motivational speaker than a social activist, but his official job title should be rhyme- magnifico. Other features include Hemi, Sy Ari Da Kid, Rock City, Mayday and Jon Connor plus Funk Volume power players Dizzy Wright, SwizZz and Hopsin. If the magnitude of Funk Volume hasn't sunk in for listeners, it finally will on this bold EP. Justin Padron and M16 produce one track each, but Kato, also a Funk Volume artist, produces everything else. His original approach and new, exciting loops mean there's a fresh, rocking beat on each of his songs. From the rich, quality lyrics and beats to the style, attitude and passion of its key contributors, Slow Motion Volume One is a smorgasbord of hip hop delicacies.",1488153600,3

104871,128,8653,"Before producer/rapper Oddisee set his sights on blowing up Brooklyn and Arizona's Mello Music Group, he set Washington DC on fire, and before he took on our nation's capital, he was sizzling in his affluent Prince George's County, Maryland home base, all the time repping his ""P.G."" stomping grounds and his multicultural makeup. The son of an African American mother and a Sudanese father, a young Oddisee (real name Amir Mohamed) would split his residency between Sudan and the U.S., witnessing the juxtaposition of the two civilizations firsthand as a small boy. Later in life, with the world at his fingertips, he couldn't ignore his hip hop calling with which producing, or making beats, became his forte. With the help of the legendary DJ Jazzy Jeff, the Low Budget Crew, Diamond District and many others, Oddisee gained national recognition and is now thriving to the nth degree with Mello Music.

Making beautiful music with Mello Music Group since 2008, Oddisee is still very much hungry as his ambition shines through in The Good Fight for 2015. A real hip hop wiseman, Oddisee is overflowing with his feelings on unconditional love, relationship ills and the losses in life. Streams and streams of poignant, pensive rhymes from this natural master of flow testify to an unflinching tortured soul who doesn't hold himself back in the least bit. Oddisee ebbs and flows through his music like the push and pull of everyday life. ""Want Something Done"" explains the blues and joys of being an underground artist, and ""Contradiction's Maze"" documents the tug of war between right and wrong. Like his lyrical heft, Oddisee's beats keenly display the rich delectability his musical style is known for. Elegant, organic music and samples make for soulful, mellow boom bap orchestrated by Oddisee's gentle, talented hand. The Good Fight is another impressive Oddisee album, progressive and very consistent for this intellectual man. It definitely helps Oddisee's evolution as an artist, though not by leaps and bounds.",1488153600,3
104872,128,930,"It's always refreshing to listen to rappers who don't wholly or excessively embrace the drug- plagued, murderous environments they grew up in, especially when they still represent these crime-ravaged municipalities, have a lot of spunk and bring something valuable to say in their stanzas. In his debut Cozz & Effect, Dreamville signee Cozz, who is a native of South Central, Los Angeles, doesn't openly portray himself as a former drug dealer or a remorseless killer but hints that they've influenced his upbringing to a degree. Having grown up in poverty and despair, Cozz raps about his marijuana, liquor, and lady- loving pastimes, but more importantly he raps about clawing up from the lower ranks of society, using his sharp tongued, vastly lyrical rap flow. All over Cozz & Effect are battle cries for anybody in the everyday struggle, i.e. great songs to rap along with. Aside from his obvious tenacity, Cozz reveals other sensibilities, like patience in ""Cody Macc,"" pride in ""I'm Tha Man,"" and Tupac-like guidance in ""Western Ave. Slaves."" The beats incorporate some drill, some soul and some airy, atmospheric chords, making for a new twist on this era's new sounds. Enimal, Free Ackrite, Bas and Dreamville Records founder J. Cole hop on the album as visiting artists, but none get as fierce as Cozz himself does. As Cozz gets vicious with his lyrics, some of his enunciation gets lost in a few fast rhyming flurries, but most of the time he is spot on with timekeeping and crystal clear in coherence. If anything is made plain from listening to Cozz & Effect, it is that Cozz has shed blood, sweat and tears building his castle and will stop at nothing short of death to defend it.",1488153600,2

104875,128,11024,"When you've got a good thing going, it's best to keep it up, even if the mainstream masses don't fully embrace it initially. Apathy (Chad Bromley), a solo rap artist and respected member of the Demigodz, Army of the Pharaohs and the now defunct Get Busy Committee, may not make as many headlines or be in the same tax bracket as Diddy, Dr. Dre and Birdman, but in the category of lyrical skills, he beats all of them.

The Connecticut-born hip-hop music-maker, who has been practicing and performing his craft professionally since the mid to late nineties, returns in 2015 with an EP, his third, titled Weekend At The Cape. As usual, Apathy lays down more clever, hardcore lines of dope lyrics and raw rhymes that never seem pass, and this is because the talented Ap is a witty songwriter, a captivating storyteller and a committed, inventive poet. He has always been an explicit, raunchy type, known to sneak his messages in quickly or in story form over traditional beats.

The memory-making moments start with ""New England Royalty,"" where Apathy warns fans not to get hung up on everything newly crowned king Kendrick Lamar does or says while still respectfully tipping his hat to the young gifted rapper. ""The Pendulum Swings"" featuring Blacastan, an age-appropriate song about real love, sets the tone for ""Ride Forever,"" a darkly romantic story about an elderly man trying to cheat death to spend a little more time with his wife.

Guests on this quaint yet cunningly crude EP are Suave-Ski, Prince Royal, Jus Cuz, Locksmith, Wildcard and Blacastan as already mentioned. In many ways, Apathy is back to his crass, coarse ways on the EP, but in other ways, he's growing up. A true ambassador for the advancement of rap music and the hip-hop movement, he still knows how to incite indignation from his more squeaky clean listeners yet also trigger common emotional impulses, making himself as relatable as the next guy. Weekend At The Cape is a very solid album but a stepping stone, not so much a grand statement, based on its feeling, depth and breadth.",1488240000,3

104882,128,14185,"Boston born DJ/producer Statik Selektah's seventh LP, Lucky 7, is more reason to appreciate the East American beat maker. Consistent, stylish, grounded and packed with the rhyme styles that hip hop purists live and breath for, it puts Statik (Patrick Baril) squarely in the list of best producers who make compilations. The album is good, but if you're like Statik and you've put one out every year or two since 2007, there's not much you can add each time except for new guests, samples and instrument loops. They mostly just become rappers' paradises as a consequence. Still, Statik does good for our culture with Lucky 7, and even though it's exactly what we expect from him, it nevertheless remains a near impenetrable fortification of solid hip-hop music.

Heavy on notes taken from East Coast hip hop and in particular the New York region (recruiting NY rappers, tossing in a dash of boombap), Lucky 7 is its designer's preference, inclination and to be frank bias for the great Northeast. Imagine guys like Rae Sremmurd, Migos, Waka Flocka Flame, Rich Homie Quan, Young Thug or the stars of Chicago trap on a Statik track. It's hard to, right? In reality, he's historically been on the side of conventional rap lyricism, but perhaps a modest dose of experimental voices like those is what his music is pining for. This insular, inward looking aside, it never gets boring listening to emcees Joey Bada$$, Action Bronson, Your Old Droog, and the boys of Pro Era as well as the OGs of Duck Down Music.

There aren't a lot of obvious differences between this album and What Goes Around, Statik's previous, (the voluptuous jazz and talk of life, love and the streets abound) so it mainly gets by on its rich, decadent lyricism, which comes in spades. Statik Selektah is still keeping doors open for the hungry, new rappers, and he and his guests all do their jobs very well here. For a quality product whose main mission is simply to 'do it again,' Lucky 7 gets good, though not phenomenal, marks. It may be number seven for Statik, but time will tell if it gets lucky. On a side note, Lucky 7 is reportedly Statik Selektah's final compilation album. It was released on July 7, the birthday of the late Pro Era member Capital Steez.",1488240000,3

104884,128,14267,"What's interesting about Time? Astonishing!, the new collaboration album between Mello Music Group producer L'Orange and Ultramagnetic's Kool Keith, is that it comes on the heels of their ""Sometimes I Feel"" joint from Mello Music's wondrous Persona LP so either they built off the creative spark of the song or an album was already in the works and they just wanted to give a sneak preview. No matter how it came about, it's still a dope album. L'Orange has once again put together a breathtaking spread of old time noir beats over which his compadre Keith raps science and swagger with the help of some of their favorite emcee friends.

As a slick, fourth dimensional rambler, the Kool Keith we witness here is as sharp with his bizarre, fanciful techniques as he was at the height of his Dr. Octagon phase, randomly ad-libbing strange ecological findings in our present time period and in the future. In fact forget ""strange"" because some of the scenes Keith describes are straight up outlandish, some might say crazy even. He may not be the belly laugh inducing character he has been at times, but he sure is every bit the cool, meticulous field researcher of his doctor side, with a new specialty: time-traveling. Nowhere is this more evident than in ""Twenty Fifty Three (2053),"" ""I Need Out of This World"" and ""Upwards. To Space!"", three short glimpses into what is most likely the fate of humankind, or at least where these artists believe it to be headed.

Let's not leave out L'Orange, a growing prodigy in his prime, who for all his skill at assembling his esoteric samples, vintage commercial clips and old movie-music loops still knows how to keep a beat with infectious hip hop drums akin to intelligent dance music. His beats are rapper- ready and at the same time, great all by themselves. Mad props must also go out to all the guests, for if not for them, Time? Astonishing! might just have been a short, sweet, two-man EP and nothing more. From top to bottom, they are J-Live, Mr. Lif, Open Mike Eagle, Blu, Montage One, DJ Trackstar, MC Paul Barman and MindsOne. Time? Astonishing! is alternative hip hop at its finest, and by beginning to explore the future of our species with intergalactic migration and cross-dimensional travel as possibilities, it certainly is venturing into unchartered territory, inside and outside of the music.",1488240000,4
104885,128,12229,"Maybach Music Group is still considered a figure head label in hip hop still performing moderately to exceedingly well commercially, but their reputation is stained by a spotted record of institutional gangsta rap albums especially from their founder Rick Ross, in recent years. The latest of the fold to start an album-legacy, Gunplay (Richard Morales, Jr.), a Carol City, FL native, Triple C's member and MMG signee since 2009, has soaring ambitions and the typical type of talent and skill seen from the label on his Living Legend debut; however, with a worn out hustler's stance as his only platform and uninspired rhymes and forgettable beats by the pound forced into every track, the shoddy, cut- short Living Legend fails to do its somewhat gifted author proper justice.

The framework Living Legend follows is noticeably contrived, abbreviated in length and unimpressive to be frank, considering Gunplay has put virtually no unique spin of his own on the gangsta lifenotes enclosed. The sections literally go like this: a braggadocious first part, a dopeboy diary middle, and then a short, introspective wrap-up. The end. And with a fifty minute run time, his narrative could have benefitted from some extra time. A variety of producers and guests like Rick Ross, Stalley, Yo Gotti and YG can only help so much if Gunplay hasn't helped his own cause enough, or in the requisite ways. Living Legend, what was probably the product of a limited budget and a lack of vision, is not bashful about caring more for the sales' numbers than the art and will most likely languish accordingly. Gunplay does carry himself as a graceful rhymer in spots, but there is so much more he could have done here.",1488240000,1

Under CMSN and David Burd Music, Professional Rapper, Dicky's studio debut, is no short order (an hour and a half run time in fact) of his highly lyrical comedy rap decorated by poetic small talk and flippant, ordinary comments. With grandstand hip hop production and interludes filled with random, Seinfeld-like chitter chatter, Professional Rapper is fun and funny with all the markings of young adulthood and is sure of its path without taking itself too serious. Lil Dicky has arrived at the majors.

David Burd, a product of the upper middle class, doesn't come from the ghetto. That much is certain. So what that leaves is studies on love, relationships, friendship, the workplace, and anything else that people of privilege occupy themselves with. Though he is a hip hop comedian, Lil Dicky does get philosophical here (""The Antagonist,"" one of the few intense moments, is a good example), and his song studying change ""Work (Paid For That?)"" shows Dicky is a pondering man's rapper. A particular group of songs on Professional Rapper though are important to note above the others.

The very ""Professional Rapper"" song was a wise choice for the second track/first actual song (""Meet The Burds"" is actually an interlude, or ""intro-lude"" if you like). In it, Snoop Dogg interviews Dicky for a rapper job, and it's simply a terrific interchange between them where the unique concept and sharp beat push them and their performance quality to excellence. ""Lemme Freak"" is the story of a couple (in this case Dicky and his girl) growing old together and Dicky's requests for sex through the years. Again, this original concept is followed through magnificently and the dialogue exchange between the characters with its exceptionally witty banter is just stupendous. Keeping with the romance/intimacy theme, ""Personality"" is important in that it stresses the role of individual identity and dignity in dating and meeting girls, and ""Pillow Talking,"" another two-way conversation song, explores the subtle dynamics of bedroom talk. Lastly, the angsty, scornful ""Antagonist"" briefly takes on this country's race and class issues.

Lil Dicky brings to rap a different perspective on life and a fresh approach to song-writing and song-making, or basically what amount to Professional Rapper's greatest strengths. With an LP as long as Professional Rapper, there's bound to be filler, and there is but not a lot here shockingly. He has put so much in the album possibly in the hopes that listeners see the lesser parts as a smaller issue, and he carries on a bit much funneling most of his creativity into close- knit lyrical powwows. Some of the songs are probably better experienced by watching their videos because Dicky is as good a visual artist as a vocal one. Guests besides Snoop include Brendon Urie of Panic at the Disco, Hannibal Buress, Fetty Wap, Rich Homie Quan, Jace of Two-9, T-Pain and Brain. Professional Rapper, a solid studio-start for Lil Dicky's rap career, is a true-to-self statement that is funnier than expected since in a way Dicky has set out to be funny on the album.",1488240000,3

104889,128,20147,"Indie rapper Futuristic (Zachary Beck), from Tempe, Arizona, has an obvious calling in life, and that calling is hip-hop. The Southwestern emcee who made his debut in 2013 with Chasing Down A Dream followed by Traveling Local in 2014 has returned this year with The Rise, his third LP. Combining his swift, intricate rap flows with powerfully thunderous beats that flirt with the commanding boom evident in mainstream rap hits, Futuristic has created a formula for capturing attention for all the right reasons and with a lot of great technique.

The young Futuristic, though very articulate, is mostly concerned with showing off his style in The Rise, which is punctuated infrequently with weighty words from deep down like the unique perspective-filled ones in ""Man on a Mission"" and ""Music Saved My Life."" In the thick of his twenties, he is in the process of shaking off his adolescent vestiges, gaining a firm hold on everything it means to be adult, and all the while pursuing his rap music destiny, at which he is no doubt talented.

With production that is as big and boisterous as its creator's lyrical bravado and abilities are (perhaps almost sounding like the result of blatant style-directives issued from out-of-touch corporate label staff, until we see or remember that this artist's label is self-owned), The Rise makes up for its beats' nearsightedness with the farsightedness of its advanced rhyme-power, some nicely maturing attitude, and its live-show-like listening experience. It is an incredibly thrilling, energy-packed performance from guests D Pryde, Samson, Cas-Tro and Devvon Terrell but most especially the rising Futuristic.",1488240000,3

104893,128,20148,"After Decatur, GA hip-hop artist B.o. B (Bobby Ray Simmons Jr.) released his third studio album, Underground Luxury, in 2013 to predominantly mixed reviews, he went on to explore some of the typical avenues open to artists of his stature, appearing on Hustle Gang's two Get Dough or Die mixtape/compilations, releasing his solo mixtape New Black in 2014, even building his own label, No Genre, promoted by the lukewarm 2015 mixtape, No Genre: The Label. The ""Nothin' on You"" singer and rapper, who is originally from Winston-Salem, NC, rose to prominence with a string of hit singles from his Adventures of Bobby Ray debut (2010) and Strange Clouds sophomore (2012) before things went further south for him in the trend-following Underground Luxury. Historically an alternative pop-rapper with a unique yet underutilized rhyme-flow, B.o. B again lets mainstream pop harmonies and his singing vocals push his very talented rapping abilities to a side role for this year's Psycadelik Thoughtz album, which is also a surprise release through Atlantic Recordings.

Not simply a cleverly named album, Psycadelik Thoughtz does have a psychedelic feel, and though there are no blatant fillers by regular music standards, there are fillers by tried and true rap standards. Probably the best track here, the first song and title track, ""Psycadelik Thoughtz,"" features some deep thinking about next level mind-states and an end of the world scenario all with a questioning tone, but the album's hip-hop integrity goes downhill from there. Regretted hostilities knock over the half unconfident ""Violence,"" which opens mental floodgates for the rest of the album's generally vague music-trip that floats along the outer margins of love, partying, self-examination and social studies. Needless to say, Psycadelik Thoughtz doesn't go extremely deep into any one of those areas.

As good a rapper as B.o. B is, it's sad that his natural rhyming talents must take a backseat to the agendas of commercial pop like they most certainly do here. Even the beats have that hissy, throbbing hypnosis typical in cultish club singles, and what's also a little troubling is that none of B.o. B's No Genre artists show up on Psycadelik Thoughtz, instead replaced in importance by a number of uncredited vocalists, Jon Bellion, and RichGirl singer Sevyn Streeter in ""Love Life."" Last track ""Have Nots"" and its study and kindness for the poor does help make up for some of the project's sugary joints. The likability of the album might have been higher had its pre-release stream been dropped in full (only snippets of all eleven tracks were available the day before drop-date) and had its status not danced around whether or not to call it the official fourth studio album by the singer/rapper. From one perspective then, the whole buildup and promotion behind the album seems a bit too unsure of itself. At any rate, forgetting for the moment whatever forces were behind making it as publicly digestible as possible, Psycadelik Thoughtz further symbolizes B.o. B's unfulfilled potential at the moment and more firmly solidifies him as a great emcee who is yet to really burst forth.

104898,128,11498,"War Report rappers from Queens, NY, Capone-N-Noreaga, or CNN, a period model of East Coast gangsta rap from the 90s and later, have returned to the game this year with Lessons, their fifth studio album and a familiar rollout of their famed street brand. Besides being almost painfully traditional for the duo, Lessons includes all new verse-material and original beats, which are conventional and come from an assortment of credible producers (Ayatollah, Hazardis Soundz, Beatz N Da Hood, etc). Their Queens homie and long time collaborator, Tragedy Khadafi (formerly Intelligent Hoodlum), plays a major and perhaps excessive guest-part and is joined by fellow features Royal Flush, The LOX, Anna Shay and Raekwon. Overall, these are loaded spots but uninteresting in their predictability. Capone and Noreaga do convey some different feelings in addition to hardcore street angst (the madness of ghetto crime in many instances of course, homie-love in ""U.M.A.R"" and lady-love in ""Chinese Girl"" for example) but they're in virtually the same format as all their previous releases. With low relevance, so-so rapping and outdated gangsterism and style, Lessons is a dwindling project from the emcees, whose peak is most likely behind them at this point.",1488240000,1
104899,128,12320,"Oakland, CA may not be the conscious rap capital of the nation (historically it's more famous for ""hyphy"" than higher learning in the hip-hop community), but as in any region, a number of wise emcees do dot the area. From surrounding Richmond, The Frontline duo grew from a bond between junior high school friends Left and Locksmith, who would go on to eschew superficial, materialistic subject matter in favor of enlightening mental building-blocks for their music. In search of a solo route post-2010, Locksmith, or Lock (real name Davood Asgari), also a respected battle rapper, kept his dignified character and began releasing a string of single man efforts, Embedded in 2011, A Thousand Cuts (his official studio debut) in 2014 and Lofty Goals in June of 2015. Distributed via Landmark Entertainment, the sophomoric Lofty Goals is elevated by Lock's very competent rhyming lyricism and a serene atmosphere of placid cloud rap beats.

Here Locksmith is confident, hopeful, and optimistic, voicing cliched platitudes from the booth, but the man does know what he's talking about and probably is in a better life-place than before. While he doesn't go head first into his past problems, he does mention a few, like being disappointed in a breakup (""Boxes""), fighting through discouragement (""Tell Me S---""), and wrestling with his conscience (""Open Doors"") for example, but he learns from these experiences in ""Lessons"" and ""Careful"" before becoming responsible in ""Blinded"" with the motivation to persevere (""The Love""). Lock is then able to find the joy that life brings in ""American Beauty"" with his lady-love from the states and also in ""10KONDRMS"" getting in an adequate workout with his rhyming talents.

A good rapper with his ducks in a row already in life, Locksmith has appropriately titled his second solo LP after his intelligent ambition and moral high road. Just as appropriate is the production which is calming, smooth, gentle, airy and soft-moving, taking its place in the sky amongst the brightest of stars. Predominantly expressing the emotions that come with having mental cleanliness and a sacrosanct soul, Locksmith's aura may lack some of the grinding, painful feelings connected to the discipline one must have to follow through with a game plan, but he has finally realized a bright, durable life-attitude that will last him the rest of his days. Also in line with Lock's syrupy vibes, sweet and kindly singers Braden Blair, Rebecca Nobel, Jarell Perry, and Marc E. Bassy lend vocals, but rappers Jarren Benton, Futuristic and Chris Webby also put in work. Lofty Goals is a respectable second album from a perspicacious hip-hop locksmith who appears to have unlocked all the secrets of healthy living.",1488240000,4

104901,128,11018,"Lil Wayne isn't the only rapper with a new album this year after breaking away from a longterm record label contract. Kutt Calhoun (Melvin Calhoun Jr.), who was signed to Tech N9ne's Strange Music for ten years before cutting ties in 2014, is apparently not letting his past get the best of him because his new EP, Kuttin Loose, finds the Kansas City emcee in fine form once again since changing brands. FYI, his new imprint is his very own entrepreneurial startup named Black Gold Entertainment.

A breathably assorted album with creative production sans any shocking surprises, Kuttin Loose presents a Kutt Calhoun who has shed some of his pompous Strange Music baggage and who is rejuvenated for his next stage in life. Every song has its own purpose, noble or not. Fly is the word of the day for tracks like F--- With You The Long Way and On Fleek, and serious hits like the vengeful Guillotine, Shooting Gallery and Regal are simply another day at the office for Kutt.

They say good art is irreproducible, and with good lyrics, keen observations and his take on current affairs, Kutt is a cut above the rest of the emcee field on this EP. The countrys police brutality problem is addressed in Handz Up (Shut S--- Down), the feminization of men today and the fear of being genuine are both excoriated in State Ov Emerge N See and a confident sign off is given in On My Own (I Got You).

Kutt Calhoun doesnt go at it alone though. He can thank his gracious guests and producers for that, but above all else, what matters most about Kuttin Loose is its symbolic emancipation and what it means in the grand scheme: the transfer of power away from the institution (Strange Music Inc.) and back to the individual (Kutt). Strange is performing particularly well as of late, and they should be wished nothing but the best, but Kutt proves here that people should not let companies control their very vitality as human beings. They must not be allowed to cloud people's ability to make rational, autonomous decisions and sound, independent judgements.",1488240000,3

104905,128,12227,"Recently, the fine folks over at Mello Music Group have fast developed a reputation for putting on and re-popularizing older hip-hop talents. Ras Kass, Rapper Big Pooh, Pete Rock, O.C. and Kool Keith all found opportunities with MMG, but besides them, the label also devotes equal, sometimes more attention to new, young artists loyal to their mission. Emcee Finale from Detroit, caught somewhere in between seasoned veteran and fresh up-and-comer, has returned to rap this year to share his Odds & Ends sophomore album, which was produced by Mello's Oddisee and released earlier this month. Streaming a seamless, conversational flow with a focus on lessons, Finale is yet another reason the underground should receive more accolades for its hip-hop.

Laid- back but wise and knowledgeable, Finale pairs well with the cool, soulful sounds supplied by his DMV music producer Oddisee. Equipped with what he has learned from mistakes and disappointment, Finale is gratuitous with his advice and tips, and persistent, refusing to let down or give up in life. While his delivery does come with many sweet, homemade porch-rhymes, it must be remembered that Finale has developed this compact yet natural-feeling style over several years. And who better to know this than the friends who have agreed to share time on Odds & Ends with Finale? In order of appearance, they are Homeboy Sandman, Miz Korona, Thalone Davis, Bilal Salaam, Kenn Starr, Hassaan Mackey, Big Tone, Vandalyzm, Invincible and Pierre Anthony.

104909,128,12214,"Friend and protege of T.I. and signee to his Grand Hustle label, Young Dro (D'Juan Hart) from Bankhead, Atlanta, the same hometown as his King of the South mentor, was introduced to the world with fun street flair thanks to his ""Shoulder Lean"" hit from the 2006 album Best Thang Smokin', which fortunately for Dro, wasn't severely panned by critics, though it still mainly catered to rap's flash-fixated, fun-familiar and hood-curious audience. Seven years later, he avoided failure again with High Times, a still highly street album with enough lyrical mettle and unique production to garner praise. Now, Dro is back with an LP (his third) that outstandingly follows a ghetto-centric gutter music-following script with hardly any skillful lyrics or style-forward beats to pick from.

Dro begins in ""Black History"" with a burst of decent lyrics lasting less than a minute and never really explores black history itself. He then willingly becomes an active member of the trap community in the majority of the remaining tracks, and the 'xerox beats' he speaks over enter into the vicious cycle of uninventive, mainstream trends like copied drill, deep bass and other sounds of hip-hop production's past. In ""Power,"" Dro steps up his lyrical game a very little bit, speaking on his various gang alliances and such, but without amounting to lot more than plain gangsta rap, and Young Dro sounds like this gangsta path is his solution to life rather than a learning experience. To him, it's either that or what he thinks will move the most units.

In ""Hustle Gang,"" Dro sounds like a pretty obvious Future-imitation, a rather flagrant bite, before he ditches the auto-tune midway through the track. ""Feeling Myself,"" the only song worth paying any focused attention to, exhibits some humility, but because this one song is the only place on the album where we hear such selflessness, it's not believable, especially since all the other parts of Da Reality Show are so appallingly weak and superficial. In ""Testimonial,"" over soul-drenched strings, we get an interlude- speech of empowerment from none other than Dro's guest Iya, not him, so it doesn't amount to a hill of beans. Young Dro does a lot of 'woe-is- me'ing next to his label-mate and soul singer Ricco Barrino in ""Hood Gospel"" when he might want to just adjust his attitude and take action instead.

In too many parts of Da Reality Show, Young Dro just hoots and hollers like a banshee, dissing his haters, threatening and perpetrating violence, arranging drug packages, taking the initiative to rep his own status and complaining about his sorry chances in life. It's a good thing he hasn't invited any huge emcees on this album because they would probably make him look bad. Just so they do not get overlooked, the other guests are Trigga, Hollywood Luck, DB Bantino and Candice Mims. Young Dro has so much pride in his Hustle Gang clan, which is fine, but it might be at the expense of developing his personality and individuality, but the most troubling trait of Da Reality Show is its dumbed down gangsterism. Young Dro has some impressive vocal endurance, but what is the point if it is wasted on subject matter and tones that never enrich the listeners?",1488326400,1

104913,128,12905,"Verbal Kent (Dan Weiss) from Chicago's North Side, specifically Rogers Park, is no inexperienced spring chicken. A hip-hop professional since the late '90s starting his Organic Mind Unit band, the thirty-seven year old emcee has jumped record labels, collaborated and faced adversity but persists to write and spit rhymes. Currently on Mello Music Group, Kent has been active with the company every year since 2013, first with Apollo Brown and Red Pill for Ugly Heroes, then with a solo album, Sound of the Weapon in 2014, and now with another solo LP, Anesthesia (released September 11, 2015). Stocked with raw rhymes, mixed feelings and thoughts, nice guests and crafty sample-laced beats, Anesthesia is solid, no surprise for a fantastic alternative rapper of Kent's caliber, and although the only thing that is very fresh in it is the writing, the album is interesting at the very least.

Getting busy everywhere on Anesthesia with his rhyme-game, Verbal Kent gets his verbal calisthenics on in ""September,"" calls out Bill Cosby and Adrian Peterson in ""Suitcase Switch,"" and just shoots off other gruesome, vicious bars and lyrics with plenty of bite in later bits. Aside from the rough housing, our man on the mic gets deeply smart too. He looks at his past in ""Add Anesthesia,"" mentions Chicago his home in more than one instance, reflects on all of life's little joys and upsets with eloquence and subtlety in ""Is This My Life,"" and gives powerful lessons like ""learning to love along the way"" in ""Save Face."" Fate is then Verbal Kent's subject matter in the first part of ""Are You Ready,"" before he decides to leave us with more of the hardcore as the last tone taken at the end.

Typical yet titillating, Anesthesia provides some insight into the world of an aging Verbal Kent who might be less hungry but is more skilled and versatile in his career. With great producers (Marco Polo, Apollo Brown, Oh No, etc.) and guests (Freddie Gibbs, Skyzoo, Torae and Red Pill) on his album, which comes via the tremendous support of one of the most prominent indies in hip-hop today (Mello Music), Kent is riding a considerably great wave for a man of his modest yet explosively potent stature. The focus going forward will be on what new and fresh offerings he can bring to rap and hip-hop besides dope rhymes, which are what he has mastered and has been manufacturing and distributing for many years now. On Anesthesia, Verbal Kent takes our pain away, but he might want to follow it up with something greater, if he wants that pain to stay away.",1488326400,3

104926,128,13635,"It seems rapper Add-2 caught a break. Connecting with and signing to Jamla Records, a subsidiary of 9th Wonder's It's A Wonderful World Music Group, Add-2 (Andre DiJuan Daniels) of Chicago can now boast of another major milestone in his hip-hop journey, aside from others like being heavily featured by MTV back in 2009. The very socially aware emcee, who has an undying desire to speak on issues concerning African Americans, uses clever metaphors and wordplay plus the occasional rap shoutout and rap quotable to entertain but also teach and enlighten. Though it follows a well built portfolio of Add-2 albums including the Tale of Two's City series, Prey For The Poor, his official studio debut, is by sound an obvious professional work from a seasoned and cultured rap mind with pressing thoughts that cannot be repressed. The jazzy, easy to love, gourmet hip- hop music so generously offered here is produced by a number of Soul Council producers including Nottz, AMP, 9th Wonder himself but mainly Khrysis of The Away Team fame, and the album's guest features include Rapsody, Jamila Woods, Sam Trump, and Raheem DeVaughn among others.

Add-2 is quite blunt and uncensored in a poetic, rap-speaking sort of way. From how he talks on the bleak, crestfallen plight of poor, ghetto-confined blacks and the crime and misery they find themselves in, you might be tempted to assume that our author here is content in burrowing himself in a hole of despair, drowning himself in feelings of woe and sorrow without fighting for the surface and paddling to shore, UNTIL... he leaps forth with giddy spirit and shines his effulgent optimism on us in songs like the upbeat and playful ""Stop Play Rewind,"" ""Green Light Party"" and the chipper first part of ""Set It Off."" Those joints and the tracks dedicated to exploring the rollercoaster ride that is love surely show that Add-2 is human, considerate, light, real and fun, but, and probably on purpose, most of the album hits us with hard facts and a serious tone (just like life itself). What ties everything together very nicely, closing Prey For The Poor out on a smart invaluable note are the last two cuts. ""Good Mourning Black America"" again studies some of the problems swirling around in the black community, but what must be emphasized is that Add-2 reminds us that a good many of the problems are caused by none other than the very individuals from those communities. Change starts from within after all. ""We Gon Make It"" is of course no less important and timely and delivers some refreshing last words of hope and positivity. Once more, the album's name is Prey For The Poor, but it might as well be called the album to end all albums for Add-2.",1488326400,4

  I have a peeve though............This song is actually 'Grazin in the Grass' by Friends of Distinction (that's right without the [G]. I'm not peeved about the spelling but rather it is confused with Grazing In The Grass by Hugh Masekela (though I like this Instrumental tune as well) on so many Oldies albums.",1488412800,5

105068,12301,8092,"Let me lay the backstory on you first, and Ill begin with the albums title Wednesday Morning, 3AM, debuting in 1964, coming from the fact that on a Wednesday night, our dashing duo had just finished their last song at 3AM in a Greenwich Village folk club, and were homeward bound to their digs in Queens  or perhaps it all had to do with the song Wednesday Morning, 3AM.  Regardless, the iconic photo was taken at that Fifth Avenue and 53rd Street stop.  The photo shoot proved problematic as several hundred images where taken that turned out to be unusable due to an all familiar suggestion that had been penned on the tiled wall, which inspired the writing of the future song A Poem On The Underground Wall, from the album Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme.

Its not uncommon for an initial outing to be a mixed bag of original material, covers, and arrangements of traditional songs, which was the case here, with their cover of Dylans The Times They Are A-Changin ushering them into the inner circle for all things Bob Dylan, and gaining cross-over fans.  For the most part the album was largely acoustically focused, and largely unremarkable, so unremarkable, along with the invasion of The Beatles, that Simon & Garfunkel broke up, with Paul headed off to the UK, and Art going back to school.  It wouldnt be until the track Sounds Of Silence was reworked as the opening number on their following album, and was presented in a more haunting rock n roll manner, that Simon & Garfunkel secured a place on the musical map and never looked back.

The release was so overshadowed by the Sound Of Silence album that many people completely overlooked it, and with that hit single being on both albums [though as differing versions], it caused confusion for many.  Regardless, what shines most on this release are the traditional and cover songs, where the duo come off as energetic, harmonious, and emotionally sincere.  While sounding sincere and ambitious, the album comes across somewhat disjointed because of this non-original material, and the fact that the songs seemed to have been chosen at random, without consideration for the contextual flow needed for a concise body of work.  While certainly better than their Tom & Jerry [with name taken from the Tom & Jerry cat and mouse comic] material, theyve stepped headlong into an Everly Brothers / Peter, Paul and Mary-ish adaptation, making the album sound a bit flat, thin, campy and uninspired.

Im trying hard to bring something positive to the table, yet in all honesty, there is little I can say about this album to make it seem worth not only your while, but your investment.  The one thing Simon & Garfunkel did, which was similar, though not as dramatic as Dylan at Newport, was that they stepped out of the crooning vocal era of the late 50s, and into the folk scene, and then nearly single handedly reinvented the folk attitude, flying under the banner of folk-rock, though still heavy on the folk side  so yes, in a sense this is an important album as a bookmark of sorts, though holds little of lasting value.

105142,3615,12308,"Wynton Marsalis and Jazz at LCO are truly perfection in every aspect imaginable. As this amazing group of cream of the crop musicians continues to explore every nook and cranny of jazz, this timely tribute to the incredible music of Cuba lives up to every expectation one would have of this fine organization. I am continually amazed at the attention to detail, perfection as a group and of each individual, the harmony that excludes from this ensemble is so far above any other, you don't have to be a jazz lover to appreciate the honed talent of each musician.

Wynton Marsalis continues to do so much to bring jazz to everyone, through the numerous educational programs, outreach and study of the farthest corners of the genre. He and his ensemble are involved at every level and when you hear them play, you are witnessing extreme passion, knowledge and talent. If you ever have the chance to hear Wynton Marsalis and Jazz at LCO live, you absolutely owe it to yourself to go - it should be on everyone's bucket list!",1488672000,5

105169,17309,16004,"This is an excellent song, the likes we do not see these days.  The only issue is that you get the SINGLE version, which is significantly shorter than the 5:51 album version that you simply cannot buy ANYWHERE.  None of the albums that carry the 5:51 version are available, and you can't get this even as ""Album Only"" material.  Which is a shame, since the album it was originally available on in 1987 is not available at all.  Even a streaming service (where you can stream the rest of the album) has ""True Faith"" greyed out and thus unavailable.

As such, it is a shame I had to steal the song by finding a YouTube video of the 5:51 version, downloading the video as a MP3 file, and using that file.  Were this to be the 5:51 version, it would have merited the full 5 stars.",1488758400,4

I usually like to check out the original version of a song when I hear a cover, and as much as I like Boye, I found Adele's to be fantastic -- a melancholy but powerful ballad about a broken heart and a regretful lover, with an understated but moody musical accompaniment that lets Adele's majestic vocals.  Though I must admit I was a little disappointed to hear such a magnificent song, only to actually listen to the lyrics and discover it was yet another breakup song... there are more topics for songs than love and breaking up, folks...

Five SCINTILLATING Stars. In 1963, multiple Academy Award and multiple Grammy award-winning composer, arranger, pianist, and orchestra leader Henry Mancini composed the triple-Grammy winning and Academy Award-nominated ""The Pink Panther Theme"" for the eponymously-entitled comedic-heist motion picture co-written and directed by long-time Mancini associate Blake Edwards. The music was coordinated with the movement of the animated pink panther cartoon character in the opening credits and has been used in some of the 11 follow-on Pink Panther movies over 30 years. It is so closely associated with Peter Sellers who starred as the bumbling Inspector Jacques Clouseau, though he only starred in about four of the movies.

The memorable Mancini musical theme was played by an orchestra made up of many of the same studio musicians associated with some of Mancini's greatest musical triumphs such as ""Peter Gunn"" and ""Mr Lucky"". Plas Johnson plays the widely-acclaimed tenor sax solo which conveys elegance, hipness, and musical buoyancy in a memorable performance. In addition, other Mancini stalwarts include Pete Candoli on trumpet, Dick Nash on trombone, Jimmy Rowles on piano, Shelly Manne on drums, Larry Bunker on vibes, Bob Bain on guitar, and Ted Nash and Ronny Lang on saxophones. The thrill of the performance beyond Johnson's key tenor sax role in stating the theme and performing the solo, include hot unison saxophone section riffs, the unison flute theme statement, unison trumpet section splashes, and key off-kilter pauses that add to the ambiance.

105352,2674,17407,"There's not much I can add to the many other glowing reviews for this album, except to say that I'm VERY impressed. I've been a Tom Petty fan since the very first album, and even though this is not a proper Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers album, or even a Petty solo effort, I'd rank this among the best things he's ever done. Really, this is that strong an impressive a batch of songs.

The first Mudcrutch album was very good, but I think this one is even stronger. As another reviewer noted, there is indeed a Travelling Wilbury-esque vibe to many of these songs. Petty and his band sound looser, more confident, and more assured. It truly sounds like they are having lots of fun and that sense of joy permeates every one of these songs. Getting better with age? I'll drink to that!",1489017600,5
105353,17701,8694,"I like this song, great mood lifter.",1489017600,5
105354,17717,16126,"The boys took a dive with this one. I bought ""Dopamine"" before the entire album was released and it gave me very high hopes after buying the energetic and very-listenable sonic surprise for me that was ""Oshin"" after its debut. But at least half the songs of the latest effort should have been erased before making them available to the public. The arrow gets stuck on the boring meter for some of the songs and others have about as much melody as a noisy dishwasher. And a song with a four-letter profanity for a title? Ooooh, that's so rebellious -- for a 12-year-old.
Back to the drawing board, boys. I haven't given up on you yet. The bones are obviously there. Stop trying so hard. Leave the experimenting in your heads. Have some fun doing what you obviously love doing. It's not brain surgery. Give us some more melodic, less indulgent tunes with lyrics that are understandable and the magic will appear again.",1489017600,3

And in despair I bowed my head
There is no peace on earth I said
For hate is strong and mocks the song
Of peace on earth, good will to men

But the bells are ringing (peace on earth)
Like a choir singing (peace on earth)
Does anybody hear them? (peace on earth)
Peace on earth, good will to men

Then rang the bells more loud and deep
God is not dead, nor does he sleep (peace on earth, peace on earth)
The wrong shall fail, the right prevail
With peace on earth, good will to men",1489104000,5

105436,17723,3325,"Amazing Lyrics!

Oh Bethlehem, what you have missed while you were sleeping
For God became a man
And stepped into your world today
Oh Bethlehem, you will go down in history
As a city with no room for its King
While you were sleeping

Oh little town of Jerusalem
Looks like another silent night
The Father gave his only Son
The Way, The Truth, the Life had come
But there was no room for Him in the world he came to save
Jerusalem, what you have missed while you were sleeping
The Savior of the world is dying on your cross today
Jerusalem, you will go down in history
As a city with no room for its King
While you were sleeping

nited States of America
Looks like another silent night
As we're sung to sleep by philosophies
That save the trees and kill the children
And while we're lying in the dark
There's a shout heard 'cross the eastern sky
For the Bridegroom has returned
And has carried His bride away in the night
America, what will we miss while we are sleeping
Will Jesus come again
And leave us slumbering where we lay
America will we go down in history
As a nation with no room for its King
Will we be sleeping",1489104000,5

One star for an actor thinking he can be a music star as well.  Then he goes with the best chance of succeeding music: country.  I think Robert downey Jr. released a CD a few years back.  It must be nice to get overpaid for a 4 month shoot on a film and then invest in yourself.  That is what I heard from this CD.  I invest in myself.  Have some more whiskey Reefer Sutherland.

105504,9069,2313,"Generally judged as one of the better psychedelic revival bands, Temples tosses its debut in the ring.  Electric twelve-strings and trippy lyrics dapple Temples walls, and a cathedral of reverb shovels a shadow of gauze atop the bands sunny, garage-rock blast.  While the foggy production keeps any one of Temples 60s/90s retro mix from standing out, a heavy Revolver-period Beatles influence is evident, as the opener Shelter Song echoes Tomorrow Never Knows, right down to the boxy snare.  However, Temples is not a Dukes of Stratosphear, wherein every tie-dyed reference is a tongue-in-cheek overstatement.  Instead, theres a reverence for its forebears, as much of Sun Structures suggests to what Journey to the Center of the Mind might have evolved, had Amboy Dukes founder Ted Nugent not gone wango-tangoing off the right-wing rails.",1489363200,4

105509,3204,20187,"Josh Garrett has become a pretty reliable bluesman in the Louisiana tradition.  Drawing on both New Orleans and the more down-home (so to speak) sounds of obvious point-of-comparison Tab Benoit (get it? Houma? home? never mind), Josh has struggled to develop his own sound on the guitar.  He has settled into a picking pattern that isn't quite as aggressive or staccato as Tab's, but isn't as slippery as Florida swamp native Damon Fowler's.  Here, it is distinctive, and with short and to the point solos, nothing overstays its welcome.  Rather than the drawn-out improvisations of his Live at Printer's Alley album, he keeps things tight, and with less of the New Orleans sound of that album.  In fact, there aren't any horns.  Just some harmonica, and some fiddle from Waylon Thibodeaux, along with the standard bass/drums backing.  This really is a nothing-fancy Louisiana blues album.  If you are looking for scorching guitar, Tab's got plenty of albums, and for some Florida swamp style, Damon Fowler's got you covered, along with that new kid, Selwyn Birchwood.  Josh Garrett is settling down, and that's not a bad thing.

My best point of reference here is an album by Russell Gulley called Back to the Swamp.  That one is even more stripped down, but combine Gulley with a little Eric Lindell, and you have Honey For My Queen.  It's a good recipe.  What keeps the album above the standard is that Garrett manages to keep a variety of moods, throwing in some rock here and there, some country here and there, all without losing the cohesive feel of the album.  I still listen to albums, and it never sounds like somebody is just messing with you by playing songs from different sources, but unlike some one-note performers (and I'll admit that the Gulley album I mentioned has a bit of this problem), there is movement here to keep the album interesting.

Nicely done.",1489363200,4

105558,5777,9789,"Love Bruce and his music. In a long and successful career he has had a ton of hits that stand out among some of the greatest hits in rock music. The best of his best to me has to be ""Born To Run"". There are many I know who have their own person favorite and could make a good argument for their choice of favorite Springsteen song. And I would agree with their reasons. But for me there is something about this early hit by the ""Boss"" that has an intensity level and sound to it that just can't be compared to any other. The longing and aching sung in the lyrics by Bruce of a guy who just wants to take his girl Wendy and find a better place for them, a better life. Bruce really gets into this song. That to me is what makes this song so good. If there is only one Bruce Springsteen song you could download on to your MP3 player this would be that song.",1489449600,5

My pressing had some kind of black speck near the edge of the first track that cause an very loud pop multiple times. I was able to remove it, but there is still a fuzzy sounding skip underneath the music during this portion. Is the album's music good? Yeah, its pretty good. But the overall quality is not impressive by any means.",1489449600,2

105582,16760,10087,"Dope album. Though Not as good as PWOWR I think.
I'm not quite sure I should be reviewing this album before ""Psychic World Of Walter Reed"" which i'm still stripping layers off of since it came out. PWOWR was a different album though, about human nature, philosophy, metaphysics and life. Planet of the Gods is kind of like a space odyssey, its a journey through time.
Now, to be better able to appreciate the album, you might want to read Zecharia Stichin's '12th Planet' and William Bramley's 'Gods of Eden'. I read synopsis of both books to get the general idea, couldn't read both books. 12th Planet is the author's own alternative history about the origin of humans; he believes humans were planted here by an ancient race/deities called Annunaki who are supposedly gods of  the ancient Sumerian civilization. they are supposed to come from a place called Nibiru. You don't have to believe it, just be open minded enough to think about someone else's point of view. You can reject it afterwards.

The track 'gods of Edin' are a play on the book 'god's of Eden by William Bramley. Gods of Edin basically narrates what could be happening when the Annunaki showed up. How they treated humans and the magnitude of their power and all. Its a story about this theory. Bramley's hypothesis is that the conflict and bloodshed in humanity have been carefully orchestrated by an alien race to keep human beings subjugated to this alien race despite incredible advances in technology and sciences. I guess its someone's way of trying to explain all the folly of mankind when it comes to violence. Both theories I reject, but I also understand the need to try to explain the human beings inability to have emotional control which results in all the foolishness of war, and violence that we see. Its all about survival. Neil Degrasse Tyson also has something to say about this sort of thing, I'll paraphrase; If any alien race were able to reach here safely, they would not harm us, why, because to be this technologically advanced you'd have to be emotionally mature in order to attain that level of advancement. Makes sense right? But still, no way to know for sure.

I digress. The album is a themed album of alien visitation to a planet and seeding it with life. And all these different kinds of philosophies and hypotheses are woven through the whole thing in typical Killah Priest lyrical fashion. Add that to his stream of consciousness writing as well, and you get Planet Of The Gods.",1489536000,4

105649,8327,5910,"It seems strange now with the hindsight of 46 years distance that 1971's hugely articulate ""Muswell Hillbillies"" by THE KINKS was such a commercial dog. Their newest platter and first with RCA Records was released November 1971 on both sides of the pond - but barely managed a No. 100 placing in the US LP charts with a big fat zilch in the UK.

But then again 1970's ""Lola Versus Powerman..."" and 1971's Soundtrack to ""Percy"" (both on Pye) hadnt bothered British LP charts either. In fact - excepting obvious crowd-pleasing hit singles between the LPs like ""Lola"" and ""Apeman"" and despite the musical-excellence of what Raymond Douglas Davies & Co. was collectively producing - the public seemed utterly indifferent  especially in their native Blighty. I can recall this album being in bargain bins for decades. Commercially this most British of bands were adrift in arguably their most creative period...

And that's where this rather excellent 2014 'Legacy Edition' 2-Disc reissue of ""Muswell Hillbillies"" comes in - determined to get us all to see the error of our fatuous ways. Armed with nine Bonus Tracks and a new DVD of period recordings on Disc 2 (all restored) - here are the cups of tea and pints of beer in the Archway Tavern...

UK released 19 December 2014 (10 November 2014 in the USA) - ""Muswell Hillbillies: Legacy Edition"" by THE KINKS on RCA/Legacy 88843093772 (Barcode 888430937727) is a 2-Disc Reissue and Remaster [1CD + 1DVD] that plays out as follows:

8. Have A Cuppa Tea

What the track list on the rear cover of this Legacy 2-Disc issue doesn't advise is that there's more footage on the DVD in-between tracks than is listed above. ""The Virgin Soldier March"" section includes the whole of the (rather rough) opening credits to the 1969 John Dexter movie ""The Virgin Soldiers"" starring Lynn Redgrave, Hywel Bennett, Nigel Davenport, Nigel Patrick and an uncredited David Bowie as a soldier (Wayne Sleep is credited). It features Ray's music playing throughout with the Mike Cotton Sound being the brass band accompanying him. There is also a short interview with Carl Foreman (clearly a fan of Ray Davies and his articulate writing) discussing how Ray's incendiary British lyrics were re-written/softened by the American studios so as not to offend or illicit riots in Washington (marches that didn't materialise). There is also interviews with the clearly bemused/amused owner of the grimy Archway Tavern Pub in North London and patrons supping pints being asked how they feel now that they've been immortalised on the gatefold album cover (cue more laughter). The Mike Cotton Sound brass ensemble are also introduced by Davies to the live audience at The Rainbow and play with The Kinks on three tracks -  ""She Bought A Hat Like Princess Marina"", ""Alcohol"" and ""Acute Schizophrenia Paranoia Blues"".

The three-way foldout digipak offers a new period photo on the left flap with tape boxes pictured beneath each CD and its see-through tray. The 28-page colour booklet is a pleasingly well-endowed affair - pictures of Ray alongside black and whites/colours of the decidedly longhaired five-piece band. The booklet's front and back cover reproduce that photo where the 'Cats On Holiday' shop is all but obliterated by aluminium sheeting. The four-leaf foldout display of centre pages shows foreign picture sleeves for ""20th Century Man"" (Japan) and sheet music to ""Supersonic Rocket Ship"" as well as trade adverts and reviews - it even has a 26 June 1972 ticket stub for the Free Trade Hall in Manchester with Steve Goodman as the support act. IRA ROBBINS of New York provides the very entertaining and well-written liner notes - examining the album's themes of Her Majesty's Government interference in normal people's lives - inner city alienation - people in red coming to take him away - all of this working-class British angst wrapped up in American imagery of Shirley Jones, Errol Flynn and Doris Day.

ANDREW SANDOVAL - who handled all of the Universal 'Deluxe Editions' for The Kinks Pye years - is the Project co-ordinator once again. But the big news is a new Remaster - the first generation tapes transferred by RICHARD WHITTAKER at FX Mastering in London and the Remastering carried out by the vastly experienced VIC ANESINI at Battery Studios in New York. Anesini is a name I actively seek out - he's sprinkled his knob-twiddling fairy dust magic on the catalogues of Elvis Presley, Simon & Garfunkel, The Byrds, Nilsson, Santana, The Jayhawks, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Mountain, Carole King and many more. This album was always a muddy mess to me - compounded by that 'Flexi' vinyl crap RCA engaged in at the beginning of the decade. There are hissy moments still on this remastered CD (the acoustic beginning of ""Holiday"" is just one of them) - but those slide guitars on ""Holloway Jail"" and the barroom piano on ""Have A Cuppa Tea"" now have more oomph for damn sure. That drum and guitar intro to ""Skin And Bone"" has fantastic punch all of a sudden - and there are other moments too. A good job done that's allowed the LP to breathe anew...

As Ray sings ""...I was born in a welfare state...ruled by bureaucracy...controlled by civil servants...and people dressed in grey..."" on the brilliant opener ""20th Century Man"" - you gather our Douglas is concerned once again for England's no-longer green and pleasant land and especially its increasingly homogenised and divided populace. Many critics commented on the depth of the song themes and lyrics (there's a lot of them) and their social commentary and insight  but it didn't seem to move the buying public in the same way. Just after the albums release - RCA put the song ""20th Century Man"" out as a US 45 in December 1971 (RCA Victor 74-0620) with the equally hard-hitting social consciousness of ""Skin And Bone"" on the B-side. But despite the lyrical/musical strengths of both sides - there were few takers. RCA Britain didn't even bother to support the album with a 7"" single - their first UK 45 on RCA Victor being the new ""Supersonic Rocket Ship"" in May 1972  which in itself acted as an advance promotion for the ""Everybody's In Show Biz"" double in August.

The hippy dream is dead and nailed to the wall in the brilliant ""Alcohol"" where some floozy has fleeced a heartbroken sucker - and The Kinks begin to sound awfully like Lindisfarne's ""Fog On The Tyne"" on ""Complicated Life"" (the accordion and guitars are clearer). You also notice how well he's integrated the Mike Cotton Sound brass ensemble into ""Acute Schizophrenia Paranoia Blues"" and ""Holloway Jail"". I never was a fan of the 'Hallelujah Rosie Lea' cod nostalgia of ""Have A Cuppa Tea"" - but I'm loving the slide acoustic guitars of ""Uncle Son"" where The Kinks sound like Ronnie Lane's Slim Chance three years before the event. Recorded 17 October 1971 at Morgan Studios in Willesden, London - the album finisher and title track ""Muswell Hillbillies"" could easily be one of those Rolling Stones Country-Rock jaunts they throw so effectively into the Blues-Rock mix of their albums (""Let It Bleed"" and ""Sticky Fingers"" jump to mind).

And as ridiculously good outtakes - you'd have to call ""Lavender Lane"" (a sort of acoustic ""Waterloo Sunset""), ""Mountain Woman"" and the superb piano pain of ""Kentucky Moon"" - more evidence of the album's greatness (even the rejects were hitting the mark). The 50-second Radio Spot advert tells of ""Album of The Year"" from many American publications - but the public itself thought otherwise. It's also nice to see the Old Grey Whistle Test and Rainbow footage so clean - and dig those credits to ""The Virgin Soldiers"" movie from 1969 with Raymond Douglas Davies credited for the music (his full name used).

I'd admit that the hiss levels on some tracks are disappointing - but as I re-listen to this excellent remaster - I'm digging it more and more and my admiration for the LP has gone through the roof. Fans apparently magic-markered their song requests onto paper plates at gigs - flinging them stage-ward as the Band played. Flick your schizophrenic paper plates this way and hope for a reply...",1489622400,5

105683,3873,17225,"I usually do not write a review for a single song, but this one I will make an exception because of every time I hear this song I cant stop moving in my chair. Can't Stop the Feeling! is a song recorded by American singer and songwriter Justin Timberlake for the soundtrack to the film Trolls, for which he serves as the executive music producer. This song was released in May 2016 on the RCA Records label. It is an up-tempo disco-pop, soul-pop number with funk influences.  In fact believe it or not, I have not heard of this song till the 2017 Oscars when he performed this as the opening number, since then I cant help listening to this song over and over.  You can find this great song on the Trolls soundtrack or as a CD single or on a 12 vinyl single.",1489708800,5

I was not familiar with this group until my daughter saw this band in concert along with Jon Bellion recently. He had told me about a few songs and I checked them out on Youtube and new I needed to add this album to my library.  This fourteen track album has great cuts such as Ride, Heavydirtysoul, Lane Boy, Tear in My Heart, Fairly Local and my favorite Stressed Out.

The first one of their songs I ever heard was ""Wasn't that a Party!"" -- on the radio in 1980. It gave me a curiosity about the rest of their music. That song is in the collection, and it is hilarious.

Now, the reason it got 3 stars is the packaging provided from the manufacture on demand feature. I have gotten 2 Calabrese albums under this feature without any problems. This item however is worse than most bootlegs that I have bought. The cover doesnt take up the whole front, inside the booklet is just black, backside of booklet is black with a barcode, cd is black with barcode ans says ""Doyle Abominator"" in yellow standard font on ot, and then the back is black with barcode and song titles with standard font and in yellow.

""Ambulance"" doesn't deviate very often but its subtle changes take on greater gravity the more you spin it. A complaint can be made about the sameness of tone and tempo, though these eight songs certainly form a mood-piece. And when you're in the right frame of mind, ""Ambulance"" sustains that molasses-slow rush of melancholy. So, if you think Mark Kozelek's ego has ruined his songwriting, look no further.",1489968000,3

105900,11310,2931,"A great introduction to Benny's early-mid '30s (RCA) Victor studio recordings from the pre-tape Electrical era (1925-1947+).

My familiarity with Benny Goodman has been, until recently, exclusively with his Columbia Lp releases, mostly live titles.  This CD is the my first exposure to his studio '30s recordings, and I find them comparatively more stale, conservative, restrained, than his live stuff.  This CD's recordings have more bass or ""boom"" than the other recordings I'm familiar with in the Columbia live recordings.  Benny was a far better live band (WOW!) than in the studio.  If you check his 1938+ live recordings against these studio releases, you'll catch that they use the same arrangements for the most part, though the live recordings were sometimes stretched out--had more ""flesh"" because studio recordings had shorter play time on disc.  One of my favorite Goodman live recordings is ""St. Louis Blues"" found on the KING OF SWING Columbia CL 817 Lp, with Benny and Harry James alternating solos blowing the house up while Krupa really kicks them along; the studio version here is a shorter take, dictated by the time restraints of a 10"" pop 78 RPM disc (pop 78s play time topped out about 3:20 or so) to fit.  Most of the rest of the recordings here evidence the same limitations.

A fun fact I stumbled across in ""Rock Music is the Devil's Music"" comes via newspaper references to a 2200 vinyl record album bonfire preacher, Charles Boykin of Lakewood Baptist Church, c. December, 1975, who blamed Benny Goodman and John Hammond for founding demon-infested rock 'n roll music in the early 1930s.  John Hammond had been demonized in fundie tracts going back at least to 1965 for corrupting popular tastes, via jazz and folk recordings released on white pop labels (Columbia, especially) as far back as 1933.  Considering that composer Meredith Willson (THE MUSIC MAN) held Mitch Miller responsible for rock 'n roll in 1956 accounts, Boykin's allegations seem sincere.  Considering the long trail of anti-rock literature tracing its lineage back to jazz syncopation, jungle music swing, Crooner war (Russ Columbo vs. Crosby) satanic voodooism, and Lombardo/Vallee/Whiteman ""blue"" filthy jazz lyrics radio ban of 1935, the great 1950 Communist folk music brainwashing conspiracy, R&B ""leerics,"" and 1956 rock 'n roll South boycott by the KKK, Boykin's opinion fits right in.

Essential!  Raise the swing Il Cornuto high!",1490227200,3

His choice of songs were so down home that all I could do was bop, bob and weave thru it all.  The lyrics may, to some, be juvenile, but to an old head like me, they were real, honest & relateable.

For all that T Bone Burnett produced them both, and it does seem that Rhiannon is somewhat restricted as an artist, here as well. Now all that said-and I say all of that having followed Rhiannon since discovering The Carolina Chocolate Drops years ago-this is still a great album. I have been searching anywhere for a version, any version of, ""That Lonesome Road"", and I was beyond excited when I saw that one listed here.

All the promoters (sp?) want is to make as much money as they can off the talents of the guys. Yes, it is true that the guys wanted the fame & money that came with their performance.

All in all it's a decent album but doesn't top Blessing in Disguise as my all-time favorite. Maybe if I'd have gotten the albums just prior to Howe's return I'd have a little more appreciation for this one.

EDIT: I went back and purchased the previous 4 albums with Ronnie Monroe on vocals, and after listenening to them a few times chronologically, I felt I needed to revisit this review.

106174,1108,8633,"I first heard this song on a mix CD created by a friend of our family, simply dubbed ""Relaxing Music.""  Of all the songs on that CD, this one stuck out the most.  It was soothing, yes, but also haunting and mystic, hinting at strange mysteries that a younger me couldn't help but fall in love with.  The eerie Celtic-inspired music and the singer's dreamy vocals are entrancing, and weave a vivid picture in one's mind.

I've heard people compare Loreena McKennit to Enya, but in my opinion Enya is more saccharine to the ear.  McKennit isn't afraid to let the slightly darker and more haunting aspects of the music come to the fore, and for that I applaud her.  I'll definitely be keeping an eye (ear?) out for more of her music in the future.",1490659200,5

106201,313,15653,"The first time I ever heard of King was on a roll up of Grammy nominees for this year. It featured a sound sample,and really enjoyed what I heard. This trio is made up of two sisters in songwriter Amber Strother and her instrumentalist sister Paris. They also have another member in Anita Bias. The pair culturally intersect their birth home of Minneapolis,being the daughters of local bluesman Percy Strother and in LA where they grew up. That's quite a significant musical intersection right there. In terms of the album,that back round provided a major curiosity as to where their general sound would go. Got the answers,and even than there's enough for still more questions.

  This album could be described as one that's separated into three ""suites"" of different types of songs. ""The Right One"",""The Greatest"" (a tribute to the late Muhammad Ali) and the closer ""Native Land"" are all cinematic mid 80's style electro funk numbers-filled with jazzy chord and key changes along with the trio's elaborate vocal harmonies. That singing approach carries over to the slower songs ""Supernatural"",""Love Song"",""In The Meantime"" and ""The Story""-all of which have an almost ambient subtlety to the same basic instrumental framework. Meanwhile ""Carry On"",""Mister Chameleon"" and ""Hey"" all showcase a shuffling retro girl group rhythm with more succinct three part harmonies.

  'We Are King' is definitely a singers album. But one that understands the importance of groups in that respect. Their harmonies,rather than solos get the priority. And the music has nothing to do with ego. Their chordally complex melodies are of a sort that require an epic sound. And they bring in that mixture of Jam & Lewis's work with the SOS Band (out of Minneapolis and LA,no less) as well as a strong dose of Afro Futurism to their conceptualization. Honestly,it might be my personal favorite album of 2016. It has a consistent sound that the trio do a lot with. And in the end,all of it really comes together in such a rhythmically beautiful way.",1490659200,5

If you are familiar and fully acquainted but don't absolutely love what he does, then there is something wrong with you.

I just stumbled into his albums recently and was completely blown away.  Then, I saw him in concert last night and became even more impressed.  His ability to move a listener - whether in recorded content or, even better, live in person, is matched by very few.  In a mass of generic, uninspiring noise, Passenger is the real deal.  His ability to weave a story in his music and stimulate emotional response is reminiscent of some of the best of the past:  Jim Croce, Paul Simon, Tom Waits, Bob Dylan.

106317,6803,19089,"Heard this song on our local college radio station recently. One listen was enough for me to buy it. The beats here are smokey and acidic, a combination of A$AP Rocky's weed-rap and the growing influence of Trap, all played to maximum effect and stylishness. Rae's voice is smooth with a slight slur, adding to the druggy atmosphere as his velvety flows slink through the rhythms. His voice is an instrument in and of itself, utilizing falsetto in intriguing ways and almost barking some of the best boasts on here (I coulda went to school to be a doctor/but I dropped out & chose to be a baller). The stuff is fire.

It's been a few years since I've spent any time with rap (sans RTJ & Death Grips), but if Swang is any indication of what's going on, I'm all ears.",1490832000,5

106383,4046,11116,"Another early live B-52's live recording. Until here recent, I never realized that when so many bands had first hit the music scene, they were so eager to have radio stations record live gigs they'd played for a later FM broadcast. Rather the genre being New Wave, heavy metal, classic rock, singer-songwriter, indie, etc. I'm definitely with what others have noted about this specific live B-52's offering. could get enough of the happening opener '52 Girls"", the awesome - possibly the disc's best track ""6060-842"", ""Devil In My Car"", the wailing ""Dance This Mess Around"", ""Runnin' Around"" and ""Strobe Light"". I've actually forgotten about just how often Fred Schneider plays the toy piano. A prime early example of classic New Wave. Highly recommended.",1491004800,5

106395,1665,18393,"I like New York Polyphony's work; this is another good recording by them, although I have some personal reservations about it.

The two major works here are Palestrina's famous Missa Papae Marcelli and Victoria's Missa O Quam Gloriosam. I think this recording of the Palestrina works very well; New York Polyphony have quite a spare, haunting sound which I find slightly reminiscent of The Hillard Ensemble, and they bring a new and welcome intimacy to the Missa Papae Marcelli. There have been many fine recordings of it. For example, I have loved The Tallis Scholars' classic account since I first heard it soon after it was released in 1980 for its engagement with the text and control of mood, its wonderful clarity of line and its huge, almost Wall Of Sound impact in places. This is quite different yet shares the qualities of clarity and engagement while being much smaller and more intimate in approach. It's a lovely take on a much-recorded work.

I donn't think the Victoria works quite so well. For me, Victoria needs a full, rich sound for the music to really speak, and this felt slightly emotionless to me. I am sure others may disagree, but I don't find this nearly as satisfying as the Palestrina.

Nonetheless, this is a good disc by a fine ensemble. The recorded sound is excellent in a lovely acoustic with just the right amount of resonance for me, and I can recommend it with only slight personal reservations.",1491091200,4

106467,17517,10442,"This set came out around 1970 on the Murray Hill label, and it was a companion to the set of Bach's harpsichord music on the same label, performed by the great Martin Galling.  (Both sets were boxed sets of 18 discs.)  Kraft performs these works brilliantly, and the recordings are beautifully remastered to CD for us to enjoy again.  If you love Bach (and who doesn't?) you'll want to download and enjoy these works.  Don't let the ""churchiness"" of the organ sound deter you; Bach only composed and played in churches because that was one of the few venues open to him at that time and place.  He fulfilled his obligations perfectly, and the music transcends the religious basis of much of his composition of the time.  He was a devout Lutheran, but the religion was in the service of his music, not vice-versa.
In any case, the bargain price of all this glorious music should be an incentive to download and enjoy it.",1491177600,5

The mix is totally flat, the cymbals and hat are trashed. Just garbage.

Also if you haven't heard her newest single yet 'Mo Bounce' I highly suggest checking it out!

Also check out her other new dope song 'Can't Lose' which was part of the Dej Dam album 'Direct Deposit' which is an album w/ different new songs from all of def jams top artist :) I will be bumping all these new Iggy Iggs songs (along w/ all her past bangers of course) on repeat while patently waiting for 'Digital Distortion' to drop which is hopefully VERY soon!!!

This song reminds me of the loss in my life, particularly, the loss of my mother five years ago. Although intended for the loss of a lover, listen again with the lose of a loved one, and you'll understand. Labrinth's youthfulness betrays his depth of understanding. He has wisdom well beyond his years. His soulful, heartfelt message and song is pure, simple, and true. Never has my spirit soared so high, or sank so low at the loss in my life.

106546,11310,20255,"LATTER-DAY-RUTH original cast.  Professional packaged CD-R repackage.

The 2 Lp vinyl set from mid-1978 is a staple in Utah thrift shops, while the recording didn't make its CD-R reissue until 2015 or so.  I bought the CD-R set to check it against the June, 1978 vinyl Lp and found the recording is the same master and the sound quality of the CD-R is better than my rather used (VG+ vinyl junkie condition, if you know GOLDMINE grading standards).  The CD-R sounds like it was sourced from the tape master, not a ""needle drop"" re-recording from what non-vinyl junkies call ""old scratchy records.""

The CD-R is missing the lyric printing that appears on the inside gatefold of the original Lp cover, but the CD insert is professional quality.

The play showcased the then-current Mormon Church anti-E.R.A. stand, using the Old Testament story of Ruth as allegory, but the play, as originally recorded, is the most jaw-dropping ODD political recording of any vinyl era LDS pop music production I've been able to dig out in my search for the just INCREDIBLY STRANGE genre' of bizarre mainstream-like Mormon pop music that had parallel retail distribution outside of normal retail channels--think pre-1985 CCM albums (Amy Grant, Sandi Patti, Jimmy Swaggart...) available only through specialized bookstores.  That weird, weird, weird climax moment on the album, the E.R.A feminist convention chant, which in the original set was on side four, listed as ""Convention Production Number."" has been edited out of this set and retitled as ""The Vision (Reprise),"" track #21.  The change is only a few seconds, ""The Vision"" is still the same recording in the CD-R version, but the deleted edit really takes away from the feeling the original Outsider Music narrative in this version.  This CD album is otherwise the original 1978 cast recording in bright sound.",1491436800,4

A huge hit for Vince Guaraldi it is one of the very few jazz numbers to go from number 1 on the jazz charts then cross over to reach number 1 on the pop charts.

She still has that haunting, soft, strong voice that propelled her, but her music seems to have stepped up a knotch. You have the ballads and....do I hear a little crunk on some tracks?  Sure did.  She still shutting it down with lyrics that float/plunge into the deep waters to the point that you have to REALLY LISTEN to what she's singing or reading the insert and taking it from there.  Songs are being alternated as to which one I love the most on that day.  So far, DO YOU THINK OF ME & HORSE PRINT DRESS have tied for first place.  The other songs are first and a half.

106598,7245,15198,"EARTH SONG is nothing short of MJ's greatest work.  While Michael definitively ruled as ""The King Of Pop"" between the releases of OFF THE WALL and DANGEROUS, some of his later work suffered from intermittent bouts of artistic deadpan.  This single, however, released during that period of flux before his unfortunate end, is his most outstanding recording ever.  Emotionally vexing, angry but tempered with hope, musically complex and built upon a bedrock of progressive rock architecture, EARTH SONG demonstrates his ability to be utterly transformative and sincerely artistic in protest.  If you, like me, collected those Pop Music perfections of OFF THE WALL, THRILLER, BAD, and DANGEROUS, allowing the rest to lay low, once you either saw the video for EARTH SONG or caught the song on radio, or even saw the updated performance from THIS IS IT (this version reaches the pinnacle of sound engineering) it probably became a must-have for you, so adding it to your MJ collection digitally through Amazon is a perfect solution.

106603,15944,13992,"I had a look on Amazon tonight to see what others had said about Chuck Hawthornes SILVER LINE album and discovered that I had never given my opinion.  That buck stops here.

I came to this excellent recording through an article on NO DEPRESSIONs site  and Ive been glad I found it ever since.  Its easily one of the best albums to be released that year.  Ive seen Chuck perform many times since  I feel fortunate to live in an area where he plays a good number of gigs.  The shows never fail to match the quality of the recoding.

Chucks writing is superb, filled with poignant imagery that has the ability to touch the deepens part of the listeners soul.  The subjects range from childhood and lifes road memories to near-hallucinogenic stream-of-consciousness dreams (check out Bound to be bound, itll leave you shaking), some of which no doubt were inspired by his military service (such as Post 2 gate ) Chuck is a Marine veteran who does everything he can to support those who have served and returned home to varying degrees of difficulty in re-entering civilian life, through such great organizations as Songwriting With Soldiers and Soldiers Songs and Voices, which encourage veterans to transform their memories and experiences into song, thereby allowing them to deal with them in front of them as well as on the inside.

Listening to the title track alone puts this mental and emotional balancing act on display, front and center.  Singing of throwing away his guns and buying a welding machine, the singer says it puts holes in my shirt but keeps my spirit clean.  Its hotter than hell and brighter than the sun  Its very much like a traditional Native American cleansing ceremony.

Chucks writing is all about life, love and healing.  His work is of the highest order, and Chuck doesnt do BS.  You can hear it on this disc, and you can experience it even more deeply by seeing him perform live.  I recommend hearty doses of both.",1491523200,5

106682,3156,17580,"Drive which is Amerie's first EP is really such a tease, it really does leave one wanting more. With seven years in between this and her last album In Love and War, she sounds really refreshed and her vocals are still on point. The album's best song is without a doubt Thru the Star which makes you feels ""I just wanna look at my life and say I did something great"", the whole song is really reflective of someone leaving their 20s (something I am currently doing). Every Time which features Fabolous is groovy and somewhat funny with its spoken interlude in the middle of the track, and really the two makes a really great pair (he was also on her last album). Trouble with Love with its quirky backing track is also great. Drive follows the DC area native's usual formula a mixture or R&B/pop (she definitely has a pop voice a good one through) and a pinch of DC's go-go music (she had to have grown up on it), but with all of her album its the songwriting and the subject matter that keeps you coming back for more.

The group finally struck pay dirt in 1984 with a tune called ""On The Dark Side"" from the motion picture ""Eddie and the Cruisers"".  At long last this talented and hard-working outfit had themselves a major national hit. The single was originally released on the Scotti Brothers label in October 1983.  Listing the artist as ""Eddie and The Cruisers"" the song spent a total of 9 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 Singles chart peaking at a rather lackluster #64.  But ""Eddie and The Cruisers"" would become something of a cult classic.  The record label saw fit to re-release the single In August of 1984.  Now the label credited ""John Cafferty and the Beaver Brown Band"" as being the artist.  The record got a ton of airplay and this time around the tune spent 18 weeks on the national charts peaking at #7.  What a terrific rock and roll record!  One of the best singles of the 1980's.",1491868800,5

106732,3156,13464,"Animal + Cannibal is a repacked edition of her debut album ""Animal"" and its follow-up the EP ""Cannibal"". Kesha is very similar to her peer Lady Gaga, the two of whom debuted at the same time; the music is pretty much the same so if you love Lady Gaga you'll definitely love Kesha. The difference between her and Lady Gaga is that Kesha's style is harder, she's the ultimate party girl, and she on a mission here to party non-stop. The songs are primarily dance tracks, with slightly harsh electronic (I think its electroclash not to sure on the sub-genre), but surprising it suits her voice, Dr. Luke and his cohorts did a wonderfully job with production despite the harsh electronic background that surrounds her, Kesha doesn't get lost in the mix and its her that stand in the forefront. Most of the tracks (the really goods ones) revolve around drinking, party, and boys. But please don't think for a minute that she is just another puppet most of it is written or co-written by her and she can actually sing. (Something she better demonstrates on Deconstructed). My favorites from ""Animal"" are Dancing with Tears in My Eyes, Tik Tok, Kiss N Tell, Your Love is My Drug, and Take it Off. From ""Cannibal"" are Grow a Pear, Sleazy, and Crazy Beautiful Life",1491868800,5

106775,12631,18349,"He was a powerful force on the Billboard charts for more than a quarter century. Over the years this dynamic artist would prove to be not only a splendid singer but a talented musician and gifted songwriter to boot. His records were a fixture on American radio through most of the 60's, 70's and 80's. Yes, Stevie Wonder truly was and remains an American original.

During the 1960's Stevie Wonder made quite a few memorable records. You might recall his first big hit ""Fingertips - Pt 2"" which went all the way to the top of the charts in 1963! ""Little Stevie Wonder"" was just 12 years old when this tune was recorded and it quickly became obvious to all that this young man was a star in the making. During the 1960's Wonder would go on to have nearly two dozen charted singles including the rollicking ""I Was Made To Love Her"", ""Uptight (Everything's Alright)"" and the beautiful love song ""My Cherie Amour"" in 1969.

For all of the success he enjoyed in the 1960's Stevie Wonder would go on to even bigger and better things during the 1970's.  Stevie was definitely on a roll and five of his singles would make all the way to the top of the Billboard Hot 100 Singles chart.  In the fall of 1976 Stevie Wonder released his masterpiece, the 2 LP set ""Songs In The Key Of Life"".  The album was an immediate smash debuting at #1 the week of October 16, 1976. It spent 14 weeks at the top of the charts and an impressive 35 weeks in the Top Ten.  The project yielded a total of 4 Top 40 singles two of which went all the way to #1.

As far as I am concerned ""I Wish"" is one of the two or three best singles Stevie Wonder ever released.  The tune earned Stevie a Grammy for the Best R&B Male Vocal performance of 1976.  This song has it all:  fabulous music, a powerful vocal and a dynamic lyric.  This is an artist who is clearly at the top of his game.",1491955200,5

I have since purchased the CD outright, but if you are a casual Joe Walsh fan and want his absolute best classic tracks, this Life's Been Good is a must have for your collection!  It is deceptively simple, deceptively because the guitar work is highly complex behind that initial basic chord progression, and the song structure is progressive rock with time signature changes in abundance.  Take a ride on this rollicking fun house classic which is full of humor and has the Eagles backing Joe on instrumental jams.  Sound engineering on the remaster is perfection!",1491955200,5

106847,17862,16670,"I've always liked this song, since the time it was released back in the 1980s. I thought the song was titled ""He is Risen,"" but it's not; however, the words are a part of the song. This song would be a great song to sing, if you are a church goer and celebrate Easter, it would be great to sing on Easter Sunday. The song is basically telling the story of the risen king, Jesus Christ rose from the dead. It first tell of Mary going down to the tomb and the angels met her there to tell her Jesus was not there. It's the biblical story. The song is great to sing on Easter Sunday because to the Christians, we view Easter as the third day when Christ rose from the dead. Frankly, if I'd be so bold to say, I think all other Christians should get on board, as some already had, to celebrate our own Easter, and make it the Resurrection day, and say, ""Happy Resurrection Day."" :-)",1492128000,5

I think I left the faucet running
Now my words are filling up the tub
Darling, you're just soaking in it
But I know you'll get out the minute
You notice all your fingers pruning up
I'm tired of being careful, tip-toe
Trying to keep the water warm
Let me under your skin
Uh oh, there it goes
I said too much, it overflowed
Why do I always spill?
I feel it coming out my throat
Guess I better wash my mouth out with soap
God, I wish I never spoke
Now I gotta wash my mouth out with soap
I feel it coming out my throat
Guess I better wash my mouth out with soap
God, I wish I never spoke
Now I gotta wash my mouth out with soap

So I fill the bath with bubbles
Then I'll put the towels all away
Should've never said the word ""love""

106872,7538,8669,"""The Way It Is"" is one of those songs I originally thought was too tame, uninspiring and bland when it first came out, but about 15 years later and listening to it on headphones late one night, I realized there's a certain mood that really captivates me.  I didn't notice this the first time around.  The piano is smooth but also elegant, and the clean production adds a sense of purity.  Of course the lyrics ""That's just the way it is, some things will never change"" applies to many *many* situations in life, and the lyrics only become more relevant as the years go by.

Coheed is typically very badass and amazing and hard hitting, but this album is the total opposite. This is like little baby girl music.

It has no teeth, no punch, no fight in it. Its like the soundtrack they would give your dog to take home after they just neutered him. This is like the perfect album to put on when visiting your 70 year old grandma, so you two can sit and listen together as she knits you a sweater and bakes cookies. And then you can crank the volume when you go out back and prance around in the flower garden.

If you like awesome music that you can respect than this album is not for you. Just go listen to all their other albums, since they are what men listen to.",1492214400,1

106917,4830,18347,"Act One by Marian Hill.

The Good:  Amazing voice.  Of course the single ""DOWN"" is what brought you to this album and will go onto every playlist you have.  The music and production of the album is top notch.

The Bad:  Unfortunately other then ""Down"" there are not any other TRULY memorable songs.  There are songs that are enjoyable as you listen to them but nothing that grabs you and makes you play it in your head during the day.  Also the pressing of this album seems to be poorly done.  I had to return the first copy I bought as it would not play in any of my computers or CD player.  The second copy again does not have any Meta Data and the album cover that is included is WRONG.  So if you plan to use this with a media server or Ipod device be prepared to enter all the Meta Data and change out album covers.

Conclusion:  I could only give this 3 stars do to the pressing of the CD  and the fact the material just does not do service to Marian's voice.  I would LOVE to hear her sing some BLUES.  On the other hand the music and production is TOP NOTCH and is very enjoyable.  I find myself concentrating more on just the music then the songs themselves which is to bad as I do think Marian Hill has such an amazing voice.  Hopefully her next album will show case her amazing voice and it will not get LOST in the music.",1492214400,3

106927,6064,12975,"There is certainly no shortage of recordings of the Beethoven Ninth and great ones at that, from Furtwangler to Bernstein's live Berlin Wall recording,  Klemperer to Gardiner's original instrument performance and many others. This is somewhat of a sentimental purchase for me: it was the Ninth of my teenage years, replacinhe was known g the Ernest Ansermet Ninth of my childhood. But if it were only that I could not really recommend it to one and all. Fortunately it's far more than that. In its day, from its 1966 release until the late seventies it was always considered one of the top three or so recordings of the great work and is still held in great honor, enough to see it continually in print since its first vinyl pressing. It appears on lists of ""bests"" and when discussed, is always given great respect and glowing reviews.

Yet it's not really well-known among even the classical music appreciating public and deserves more press and broadcasts. The reason is that Schmidt-Isserstedt was a conductor dedicated to music who did not court publicity the way some of his contemporaries and most of the next generation did. Though he became well-known in Europe he remained virtually unknown in America where he was known mainly to very serious classical music fans. Most of his recordings were not released outside of Europe with the exception of his complete Beethoven Symphony cycle which drew raves from the very beginning with special attention to his Ninth.

Schmidt-Isserstedt followed the usual course of a German Conductor, studying in Heidelberg, Munster and Berlin and conducting orchestras around the country, including opera houses. He managed to avoid ever joining the Nazi party and was invited after the war by the British to found a new orchestra, the North German Radio Symphony Orchestra which he brought to great acclaim. He made it a point to program Hindemith, Bartok and Stravinsky, all composers banned by the Nazis. He was one of the first to truly appreciate Mozart at a time when that composer's music was still thought of as a light Rococo confection on a par with putti and Fragonard paintings. He made several recordings of Mozart as well as many public performances  to let the music speak for itself to the classical listening public.

Schmidt-Isserstedt's Ninth strikes me as the music virtually appearing right off the page without an intermediary. In a certain sense he takes a middle path with it but that makes it sound bland and it's anything but that. He neither rushes nor slows it down and never changes any aspect dramatically to make some kind of point. It is a straightforward, serious version, seeming very pure yet vivid and full of life yet also elegant. And then there are the vocalists for the great ""symphony within a symphony"" a group that has never really been topped. First there's Martti Talvela's magnificent bass, soon joined by tenor James King and the sopranos, Joan Sutherland and Marilyn Horne. They perform together as one in beautiful, glowing tones. They are joined by the Vienna State Opera Chorus who singThe Vienna philharmonic responds wonderfully to his conducting. radiantly. This is a Ninth that you won't forget.

This is the Universal Japan edition of the performance. i chose it because it seems to be the most recent pressing and I assumed would have the most recent remastering. Polygram released it on the midline London Jubilee label decades ago. it does sound wonderful but I can't be sure of a remastering date because the seven-page booklet is entirely in Japanese. It may have also had some interesting things to say about Schmidt-Isserstedt and the history of this recording, but I will have to live without those niceties. The music is the music for all people everywhere and that's what really matters.",1492214400,5

When they finally came back from their long hiatus with their self title in 2001 they have been cranking out new music by the boat loads. Unfortunatly while there have been hits like 'Keep Fishin', 'Pork and Beans' and 'Memories', their albums as a whole have been hit or miss at best. Their previous album really made me feel that they were coming back to their classic ways with a very strong album in 'Everything Will Be Alright in the End' Their new self-titled 'White Album' is a long miss from that level. The songs are not memorable and the album just does not resonate.

I feel that like some of my other favorite bands this is another that I am just going to give up on when it comes to future releases. I feel that Weezer has left their mark on music but, there is no reason to stick around knowing that your band will not be forgotten.

By

Rob Jones

Maxs Kansas City, New York City was a stand out venue in the promotion of new underground music through the 60s and 70s. The Manhattan venue saw many an iconic name in its infant stage pass through its doors-and, this outlet is one of those sonic spaces that trips off the tongue when in discussion about the immense history of rock music in The Big Apple.

Bruce Springsteen was but one of those up and coming acts to take to the stage at this famed location on 213 Park Avenue South and a 31st January, 1973 set has been captured for posterity on CD. The 69 minute release originally heard on FM Radio features nine big compositions  none of which come in under five minutes; and, this was a year that had Mr. S play an amazing 17 times at this site. Therefore, it is evident that The Boss and his quest for the epic had already begun well in advance of his global fame-and, on the back of his debut album. A mostly acoustic feel leads the proceedings but a band can whip up the atmosphere when the need is required. However, in a smaller club this sound does not take on the magnitude of the momentum of latter year stadium Springsteen. However, what is good here is that a more intimate performance catches Bruce is an environment whereby his mostly stripped down songs provide a platform for his lyrical lustre. One can see a link here that years down the road could feed in to the work of Nick Cave. The stories of urban under-life and the characters that roll along the roads that can be far from Glory Days take hold of the proceedings  and points ahead to future tunes as well as taking the rarity path.

The quality of the recording is good and as well as being a valuable piece of the Springsteen jigsaw it is also a golden ticket in to the vibes of a celebrated auditorium  which sadly became history in 1981. Max-imum young Bruce offers a supreme Spirit in the Night!",1492387200,4

The melody is beautiful, and the orchestration sounds typical of Mahler.  Some of movement 2 sounds too loud and chaotic, even strident; Mahler never wrote such repulsive music.  Movements 2-3 employ the harsh sound of trumpet more than Mahler would.  The themes of movement 3 sounds Mahlerian.  Some parts of movement 4 are frenzied, and I instinctively recoil from them.  On the other hand, there are some brief pretty melodies.  Mahler was not so profligate in his use of fff.  Movement 5: after the attack of the bass drum, the soft flute and violin melody was a welcome relief.  The tuba-bass drum-trumpet onslaught at 5-7 minutes is bad enough, only to be followed by harrowing musical experiences of more strident passages.  At 13 minutes a lovely melody in woodwinds and French horn enters, spoiled at 18 minutes by a dreaded crescendo.",1492387200,2

American Authors is a perfect blend of all American sound. With a success of their debut I have to admit that their follow up while it is good, will take time to fully appreciate. The songs a little more musically complex and the lyrics are just as heart felt and personal. The only disadvantage of this sophomore release is that most of the songs do not have the radio appeal as a large portion of the tracks on the first album.

I still think these remasters sound a little bit muddy like the Abkco CD. I am playing this on a decent quality Sony boombox CD player and I think it is muddy. I'm listening to this CD by downloading flac versions from YouTube of this particular album, and I used it to help complete my Ronettes Phille Spectre anthology double CD of their complete recorded output. I have titled it ""Be My Baby: Complete Original Phille's Anthology 62- 66"". I think instead of releasing this 18 track disc, it would have been a better idea to include all the masters over 2 discs on 36 tracks. The Ronettes discography is really small, and it could all cram itself on a double album. Everything here is wonderful and everything not here is great.

107040,2191,19118,"Ricky Kej is an Indo-American musician, composer and environmental conservationist who has contributed to numerous outstanding projects over the years, including his own Grammy Award winning album, Winds of Samsara, which was released in 2014 with South African flautist and composer, Wouter Kellerman. On his latest musical ambition, Shanti Samsara (subtitled World Music for Environmental Consciousness), Ricky is joined by an international team of recording artists who variably contribute an array of world instruments and vocals on this definitively glorious global musical project. Just a handful of contributing credits includes familiar names such as Alexis DSouza, Darlene Koldenhoven, Patti Austin, Ron Korb, Seay, Tina Guo, Vanil Veigas, Vito David Gregoli and Wouter Kellerman, among many other talents. Released as both single and double disc editions, the single disc version includes fourteen compositions presented in a colorful gatefold package, whereas the double disc version comes packaged in a stunningly beautiful 150 gloss-page book. Making for a wonderful centerpiece, the book provides detailed insight into the albums creation, which includes chaptered short stories highlighting the inspiration for each composition. Photographs of the numerous recording artists involved in the project are also included, as well as visually stunning images of landscapes and scene sites from around the globe.

The track, New Beginnings, opens the single disc version of the album, while its the second track of disc two on the 2-CD version. Rocky Dawuni leads the piece with English-sung lyrics, while Varijashree Venugopal provides supporting Indian vocals, immediately conveying a sense of having stepped back in time, perhaps even walking right onto the set of an old Bollywood film. Wouter Kellerman plays his signature flute, as the collective array of keyboards, strings, percussion and authentic Sanskrit choir create a grand, encompassing soundscape. One of many highlights on the album includes Samsara, which was the first song Ricky composed for this project once the concept of Shanti Samsara had crystallized. Guided by an assortment of flutes, drums and percussive instruments, the stellar vocal performances of Philip Lawrence, Patti Austin and Alexis DSouza are given additionally soul-stirring support by South Africas Soweto Gospel Choir and Ladysmith Black Mambazo group. A beguiling synthesis of African and Indian musical elements that are further graced by exquisite English-sung female vocals throughout, the piece seemingly recalls that of a barren desert slowly unveiling a beautiful oasis of vivid green and blue. Named after Indias own majestic river, Ganga is an equally opulent number, which opens with an exotic atmosphere of flute, sitar and synth that seemingly alludes to a mystical journey inwards. Like a lotus flower gradually unfolding, the piece soon blossoms into a vibrant display of grand orchestration and accompanying chorus, as Shankar Venkatraman provides lead vocals in Indian Konnakol (Scat). Seasoned with a more distinctive East Asian flavor, Vishwa is easily one of the most spellbinding moments on the album, in which Ani Choying Drolma provides lead vocals over a mesmerizing arrangement of strings and synthesizers. Painting vivid imagery of a desert nightscape, sparkling textures seemingly mimic twinkling stars, as one might easily envision a traveling caravan coming to rest for the night and being gently soothed by the lulling serenade. On Kudrat, Seay ethereally sings in Latin, the intonations of her vocals imbuing the piece with a hauntingly reverent aura. A captivating confluence of two ancient sacred languages, its easily the albums most mysterious piece, as Sanskrit choirs caressingly brush upon its lush arrangement and warmly seductive rhythm. The Monks of Sherab Ling guides the listener to Tibet with the ritual chanting of monks. Here Butto plays flute in an improvised fashion among various temple instruments in what feels like a real-time Tibetan Buddhist ceremonial experience. Compassion is another pinnacle moment on the album, which opens with spoken word by Japanese Prime Minister Shinz Abe, as Mitsuki Dazai plays Koto and Butto lends Bansuri. Exuding a hypnotic, summery vibe and smooth bass-laden groove, its easily the most chill-out style track of the lot, recalling something one might hear on the Buddha Bar compilation series.

A ravishing album for a wonderful cause, Shanti Samsara perfectly epitomizes authentic world fusion music, as heartfelt words and thoughts are expressed in many beautiful languages in tandem with the pan-cultural musical textures brilliantly woven into the fold. Unfurling throughout like a cinematically epic journey, the albums colorfully coruscating layers of depth, richness and soulfulness are unquestionably inherent to this musical master-talent who seemingly turns everything he touches into gold!",1492560000,5

107048,2282,9196,"Cool recording (audience....I think?) of the Floyd's Animals tour.  Slightly bass-y but not bad at all,variable vocal volume,but quite listenable! Much better than my old vinyl copy (which was called ""A Great Set"").  Here you get Pink Floyd on the infamous Animals tour that got more and more aggressive until Waters spat on a fan late in the tour(it WAS the time of ""punk"", you know!).....and he thought, ""What the hell am I doing....?"" and wrote the WALL because of the loss of fan/band sympathy.

But this isn't any love-fest,....NO the band seem a bit riled-up and sing aggressively at times too.  Are they tired,are they fighting each-other, are they close to breaking up......God (and they) only knows??  In any case it's a weird time for Pink and the boys(just joking ...ya know?).  But I still find this a good listen.  If you don't mind a bit of off notes (in voice and instrument), or a few times when the (well known ) vocals are a bit lost to the instrument volumes....and you just NEED to audibly witness these songs that are rarely played ,......then this is a fine way to check it out.

At one point during ""...Crazy Diamond"" I think the on-stage fireworks blow out more than just sparks.....and cause a moment of confusion and shock too.  Remember.......it's all purely LIVE.....no over-dubs.  Warts and all.......I think this is the best we can hope for as far as a document of the 1977 Pink Floyd shows.  I still really love ANIMALS,......and this does me just fine ,since I couldn't ""be there"" at the shows.  Take a deep breath .....and listen.",1492560000,4

107077,1108,5098,"I just have to say this -- I have no idea why this song is titled ""Iris.""  The name doesn't crop up anywhere in the lyrics, and while I don't believe that a song's title has to be part of the lyrics (see Queen's ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" or Green Day's ""Good Riddance""), it can be confusing to people trying to search for the song online.  The song did first appear on the soundtrack of the film ""City of Angels,"" which I haven't seen, so perhaps the title has something to do with the movie?  *shrug*

At any rate, despite the possible confusion over the name, this is a lovely song, a love ballad with powerful guitar music and melancholy but warm and inviting vocals.  It's probably not the greatest love song of the '90s, but it's certainly one of the most memorable, and continues to resonate with listeners long after the film it debuted in has largely faded from memory.

Her lyrics are of that level that being an adult will make you undestand, and her duets with Usher & Jhene Aiko shows that she has the ability to play with the big kids on the musical playground.  This is THAT cd that the fav alternates with each spin.  Right now, track #2 is my fav, but I'm sure that will change.

107110,1829,18381,"The Fall has been cited as ironically ""the fall"" of the Gorillaz. Both the fan base and Damon Albarn would agree that this is the groups weakest album musically. However, that doesn't mean this is a bad album by any stretch of the imagination. I would argue that this is Gorillaz most ambitious album to date, just for the simple fact that the album's creation was limited at the time of its release. This album was completely composed by Apple iPad music apps. The amount of depth and creativity Damon was able to produce and record off of a simple iPad is truly astounding to me, because despite the album not breaking any new ground sonically, the music on this project is still of high quality. I personally can enjoy this album on its own merit. But when compared to the previous 3 Gorillaz project, it falls short. Because of Damon's choice of using only music apps, the albums sound is not as rich or organic as past albums are. This album has a much more electronic feel than the previous 3 albums and it does suffer for it. The song-writing does not grab your attention as much and the songs aren't nearly as catchy. Its an average project for Gorillaz, but far more creative than most artists can drum up.

Four b/sides are here also, but interestingly, one is a b/side of a song released on Chesnutt's 3rd album.
The one missing b/side is 'Blame It On Texas' but is a repeat of that hit from his debut C.D. - Too Cold At Home.

This entire album from 1992 is good. Some excellent album tracks =
Uptown Downtown (Misery's All The Same) - Postpone The Pain - I'm Not Getting Any Better At Goodbye - Who Will The Next Fool Be.

Chesnutt & George Jones duet is good, and here's Chesnutt's solo version - It's Not Over (If I'm Not Over You)

Now that the BD has been rereleased, I finally have the quality media that is commensurate with my audio/video system. The performances are exceptional and span the entire catalog of the band's music featuring singer/keyboardist Steve Walsh, guitarist Rich Williams, violinist David Ragsdale, bassist Billy Greer, and drummer Phil Ehart. The fact that the concert was performed with the Washburn State symphony added to the ambiance and quality but was not the only surprise, as former members Kerry Livgren (guitar/keyboards) and Steve Morse (guitar) joined the band for a couple of songs. Admittedly, Robbie Steinhardt's violin and vocals were missing but David Ragsdale more than adequately covered the violin parts and the vocal harmonies and background vocals were still superb.

107124,17895,3685,Sonny plays all alto sax on Blows The Blues as stated by Leonard Feather in the original liner notes and I can confirm it. The Fresh Sound back paper wrongly credits him with both alto and tenor. He plays the opening of a couple of tunes in what must be the lowest key possible in the lower register but the alto sax is unmistakable in the ensuing solo. He gets a good sound out the lower register approximating the sound of the upper register of the tenor. On the Hard Swing he plays alto sax 7 times and tenor sax 4 times.  Pianist Lou Levy gives way to Amos Trice for the second session but Amos doesn't take many solos with Stitt playing the whole track himself most of the time.,1492732800,4

107165,15832,20290,"Sadly too short an EP, only 4 tracks (didn't they ever record themselves live?)  Also, disappoint-train their cover of Rolling Stones' ""Paint It Black"" wasn't included either.  Version I ordered here from Amazon is a cheap print/burn, dunno if band offers genuine physical copies for sale.

Not the best place to start for the uninitiated.  If you're new to the band, I'd recommend Solidify for people more into groove & rocking (listening to Solidify turned me onto Tool's Opiate), Nemesis or POIS for old school speed/thrash metallers or Incorporated for the culmination of all their sounds, but heavier than ever.

Gus Chambers is a vocalist I've only heard singing for this band.  He had an incredible, accessible grit and soaring delivery.  Shame more people don't seem to know about Grip Inc, even back in the mid-late 90s when I was getting into metal.  Any of their albums are more interesting than anything Slayer's done since Seasons (except the punk covers album)",1492819200,4

Now, as a grown up who watched a loved one fight and loose a battle with drug addiction, I get it.  And for a pop song, this is actually pretty haunting in it's sound.  But that is appropriate, because that is exactly what addiction does...it haunts not only the person who is using, but everyone in their lives.  And sometimes, like in the original video for this song, you end up with nothing but memories which will continue the haunting.  So many people think they're just signing on for a bit of fun, whether it's with street or prescription substances, and end up signing their lives away.  It's been 15 years this week since my brother passed away.  And it's a week that always haunts me, as does this song.  But I still love this song, even now that I am very painfully aware of what it means, it holds up very well to the passage of time, and not everything does.",1492819200,5

Yes, the music is the typical Trans-Siberian Orchestra blending of rock and classical music. However, the story is one that seems to echo in this time. I am so glad my friends gave me this album (2 CDs); I think you will miss something essential if you have only the streaming music or MP3 versions. The booklet included with the CDs adds depth to the sung story, not to mention Greg Hildebrandt's wonderful art deserves admiration.

I think this quotation is what I will take away: Do not dwell on the monstrous injustices done by humanity to humanity, since the dawn of mankind, more than you study how these wrongs and injustices were corrected. The study of the individuals and civilizations that overcame these evils is the key to mankind moving forward.

If you enjoy the Trans-Siberian Orchestra, I think you will like this. Do go ahead and get the physical album.",1492905600,5

107216,3161,15131,"Usually when you mention the word ""shred"" it's time for me to run screaming out of the house.  That most self-indulgent form of hard rock excess, along with a lot of jazz fusion that was technically inarguable but boring as hell, has its place if you're a guitar student I suppose, and obsessed with musical theory to the nth degree, but like anything, too much of a good thing can be its own death.
  I had heard good things about Exmortus, and decided to check them out.  ""Ride Forth"" is for those fans of Holy Grail, Vektor, and progressive metal as a measuring stick.  However, they manage to write some good tunes amid the classical riffage, with speed and attitude, and that makes a lot of difference.  Classical music was the first form of musical prowess, and it too can be beautiful and moving, or more boring than being in a funeral procession on a one lane road where the hearse has had a breakdown and nobody can move.  Same with shred, prog rock and some modern jazz, as previously mentioned.  Exmortus seem to be aware of this pitfall, and while they certainly put enough lead work in their songs to satisfy the most insatiable shred fan, they put thrash and a tad of death in for a tougher sound and make their stuff catchy.
  This reminds me a bit of Vektor, the sci fi/shred/thrash descendants of the Voivod realm, but Exmortus wisely do not overplay and make songs too long, which would be a critical mistake.  I prefer Vektor, but this is a good album for those wanting some musical dexterity with their metal, and these guys would be right at home in the family of proggers that are a bit more heavy, or trad stuff like Iron Maiden.  Guitar buffs wanting some lessons on scale theory could do worse than listening to Exmortus.",1492905600,4

107292,17907,15196,"If you're looking for authentic bluegrass music, look no further.  The Sideline Bluegrass Band headed by Steve Dilling follows the traditional road of down-home mountain music.  It was a road laid out by guys like Bill Monroe, Flatt & Scruggs, the Wilburn Brothers, and Jim & Jesse.

I saw the group recently at a place called Fogartyville in Sarasota, Florida.  Some of the band's personnel is different from the lineup on this CD but the sound definitely remains the same--which is excellent throughout!  Steve Dilling (the group's patter-man and story-teller) and Jason Moore were founding members of the group when it was still making music as a 'sideline' business.  Today it is their fulltime gig that now takes them to every corner of our country.

With the changing personnel, the big question is: where do they get all these Class A fiddlers, mandolin players, and harmony-singer sidemen that seem to appear and disappear in the lineup.  And how do they manage to maintain the harmony and blend that is one of the group's many trademarks?  I also admire the leader's commitment to keeping those sidemen highlighted.  He does this by usually placing their names on the front cover instead of burying them in small print at the bottom of leaf four.

""Mountain Girl"" is a good, rousing number that demonstrates the excellent blend of voices as well as the top notch banjo picking and fiddling.  ""I Won't Go Away"" provides a sour grapes message by a loser (stalker?) who won't take no for an answer.  ""Flora, Lilly of the West"" has been covered by many folk and Americana luminaries like Joan Baez but it never sounded better than this Blue Ridge Mountain rendition.

""I'd Rather Die Young"" has an upbeat tempo despite its downbeat message.  Following along those same lines, the message of  ""Kentucky Country Home"" is that when things totally fall apart in the outside world, the hometown roots are always there and more than willing to welcome you back with wide open arms.  ""Rose in Paradise"" is another song previously covered by many notables.  Waylon Jennings comes to mind.  And ""Lord Don't Leave Me Here"" is a full-throated gospel done in classic, a cappella, bluegrass style complete with high clear tenor, a solid bass voice, and well-blended harmonies in between.

So if you like bluegrass music that is the 'real deal', look no further.  The Sideline Bluegrass Band is the one to latch on to.  They also have a couple other CDs besides this one and they are all  first class and available on Amazon.

107329,56,18035,"There really have not been all that many songs that have really drove from the world of country music the past several years. The songs have either been gently from one zone in sales, but have not crossed over for better success or they just haven't had the chemistry that delivers for it with the work accomplished. For Keith Urban, he has had a lot of joy in his career with his success in country music. But overall, he has not had that widespread success cross over into the pop world, as was the case with Shania Twain or Faith Hill had delivered. Now, with a slew of good performances he has had, he now is trying to cross over with pop with his latest single, The Fighter from his album, Ripcord. the song, which features Carrie Underwood, works well for him as a solo track, but as a duet it misses the mark a bit. Carrie Underwood surprisingly underperforms on the song with having more of a voice into the pop anthem. While it sounds like a hit for Keith, and it is, there could've been a bit more chemistry into the track overall. It is a good download for die hard Keith Urban fans, but there could've been more from Carrie for a higher score.

107356,9069,16006,"If you're one of the moral minority with a healthy disdain for stock drum machine rhythms, sound-alike synth patches, and vocals that are compressed, de-essed, and auto-tuned to the point of emotional sterility, then dive right into Lake Street Dive.  Side Pony is the bands fifth release, another refinement of the bands original sound conceived by the quartet at the New England Conservatory and birthed in Boston.  No, this is not a hoity-toity recital of sterile adroitness.  Lake Street Dives chops rock a side pony (its a hairstyle) with doses of retro soul, R&B, jazz, rock, and Brill Building banter.  Vocalist Rachael Price belts out a fierce independence, and bandmates Mike McDuck Olson (guitar, Rhodes, and trumpet), Bridget Kearney (upright and electric bass), and Philadelphias Michael Calabrese (drums and percussion) answer in kind.  Its all in the key of fun.  The Motown echoes of Call Off Your Dogs, the wry laments of Mistakes, the ping-ponged guitars of Hell, Yeah, and the carefree confidence of the title track are each sound examples of how it used to be done before the machines took over the Top 40.  Lake Street Dive is Beantowns answer to Phillys Hall & Oates (whose Rich Girl they even covered on an earlier EP).  To paraphrase, because they rock a side pony, baby, they're just livin their life, because they rock a side pony.",1493078400,4

107428,3574,17785,"While this is a pretty decent compilation, it's just too uneven.  It has far too many songs from certain albums and not enough from others.  It's got 8 (!) songs from Flaming Pie, while other albums like ""Run Devil Run"", ""Driving Rain"", ""Flowers in the Dirt"", and all the live albums have nothing at all.  From my understanding, the only reason there are no songs from ""Flowers in the Dirt"" is because the remastering wasn't complete yet.  Then why not just wait?  That album was the commercial and critical comeback for McCartney, and it contained many great songs (My Brave Face, Put it There, This One, and Figure of Eight, and We Got Married were all standouts).

Other essential songs are missing as well:  Spies Like Us, Once Upon a Long Ago, So Bad, Take it Away, Give Ireland Back to the Irish, etc.  Instead they've included some odd choices like Bip Bop, Good Times Coming, Temporary Secretary, and a few too many songs from ""New"".  And then there's the edits and remixes.

Other people have complained about the lack of Beatles songs.  McCartney has plenty of great solo songs to fill 4 CD's without including The Beatles.  A few ""live"" versions of Beatles songs could easily have been used.  ""The Long and Winding Road"" from ""Wings Over America"", or maybe ""Hey Jude"" from ""Tripping the Live Fantastic"" would have been nice.  Regardless, there is nothing here.  With a better track list, this could have been an awesome box set.  Instead, it's just an okay one.",1493251200,3

107497,2674,19311,"This is one of those albums that I really wanted to like, or least wanted to like more than I did. Not sure what the problem was for me. This ""type"" of music is normally the sort of stuff that I love. It's a very soulful blend of music (pop, rock, R&B, whatever you want to label it) with some definite retro roots in the old Stax and Hi Records sound. Great organ playing too. And yet, two dozen plays later, it never left a strong impression on me.

Honestly, it really bothers me that I didn't get into this album that much. I had such high expectations after reading so many glowing reviews and positive articles about the band and I'm truly disappointed. The vocals of the lead singer aren't bad, but neither are they particularly distinct or memorable. While I admire the group's obvious love of old soul music, the overall sound is a bit derivative and nothing special. And that sums up most of the songs too. Clearly, this band has their hearts --- and soul --- in all the right places, but it feels, and sounds, like something crucial is missing.",1493337600,3

One happy result however is showing even at that late stage in his career, he was very engaged in his repertoire , albeit not as recorded in the studio .we must surmise he was fed up with some of the choices he was forced to make through the publishing company and how his final equalizations were dismissed .
I gave away my copy to a good Elvis buddy who especially enjoys the ""deeper voice"" big ballad Presley.

107666,7974,10918,"""The Suburbs"" is Arcade Fire's much acclaimed third album. It's a relatively long album, which plays for about one hour; so it may take some time to get a good overview of the music.
If you got the grip of the very exciting debut album ""Funeral"", you should be likely to enjoy more music in the same genre. It can be difficult to describe the music in few words, but groups like Velvet Underground and Talking Heads must be among the inspiration sources. The sound may seem a bit scratched at times, but the numbers are quite varied, ranging from the very melodic to the noisy and punked.

An important prerequisite for being able to keep Arcade Four right, I think, is that you appreciate the two singers of the group, of whom Win Butler obviously is the most important one. The female voice, R&eacute;gine Chassagne, may appear a little flimsy, but she also possesses a speciality that some will enjoy and others dislike. Personally, I'm a fan of both of them, especially when they deal with melodic songs with the group; On this album one could highlight ""Half Light"", ""Suburban War"", ""Deep Blue"", ""We Used to Wait"" and ""Sprawl II"".
In general, you might say that Arcade Fire is a group that sets certain demands for its listeners; Not much easy listening here.",1493510400,5

107755,17957,3845,"Mr. Sandman by the Chordettes is now ubiquitous Americana. Even if the name doesn't ring a bell you have almost certainly heard it. It graced the end of Halloween, the classic horror film and has been in any number of movies depicting the fifties era. I dare say it makes you feel like it's the fifties. The Chordettes are important in rock history as one of the first ""Girl Groups"" as they were called, to break into the charts at a time when sexism was standard practice and other phenomenal groups (Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Roy Orbison to name a few) were king. Many female vocalists existed but these harmonies belonged to the Chordettes and gave them a place. Mr. Sandman happens to be the creme de la creme of their work in my opinion.",1493683200,5

Obviously, rating music is so subjective that it isn't everyone's cup of tea. All I can advise you is to listen to the sample and then decide.

And that's not a bad thing. The Thriller videoreally an explosionblasted shock waves that still shake MTV even today.

So, Ms. Stirling has this squeaky-clean; Osmond smile and values;  BYU stone-cold/clean-and-sober image about her. It's what she wants, and what her fans are comfortable with. It's a good call, considering her theological point-of-view. She is living and preforming with 100% spiritual and moral integrity.

But we have this scary song. Of course, as things go, this song is barely PG scary. Remember, this is her first album, she is still in Provo with the Halloween corn mazes and  FHE-group spook alleys. And she is is still sending out feeler, trying to find her self artistically.

On top of that, remember the other scary Mormon: Stephenie Meyer. <a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Twilight-The-Twilight-Saga-Book-1/dp/0316015849/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Twilight (The Twilight Saga, Book 1)</a> came out in 2005, seven years  before Stirling's eponymous album (2012). Meyer's books were all the rage among the Beehives and Mia Maids and Laurelseven my mom read them all, and that is saying something. It would be very strange if Ms. Stirling hadn't read these books ... and been influenced by their shadowy tone.

This raises an interesting theological question. Heavenly Father is described as being the Father of lights (James 1:17), and also it is written that which doth not edify is not of God, and is darkness (D&C 50:23). Furthermore, the LDS Church has warned about the dangers of occultism and the works of darkness (See First Presidency Letter September 18, 1991; cf. Handbook 2:21.4.8).

Moreover her father wrote a 100-page book dealing with this subject (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shedding-Light-on-the-Dark-Side-Defeating-the-Forces-of-Evil-A-Guide-for-Youth-and-Young-Adults/dp/B00F5FAAIW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shedding Light on the Dark Side: Defeating the Forces of Evil (A Guide for Youth and Young Adults)</a>), which goes to show she fully knows what's going on viz-a-viz this metaphysical realm.

On the other hand, in the US Halloween parties are commonplace, and even Thomas S. Monson, the sixteenth president of the church, horsed around at church Halloween parties as a youth. And he referenced the legend of Dr. Faustus in one of his General Conference talks (October 2008, Until We Meet Again.)

(This comment on Halloween parties applies to the US and Canada. I served my mission in Portugal in the early 1990s, and there Halloween was still the Roman Catholic celebration. The Portuguese, like their fellow Brazilians, dressed up for Carnival/Mardi Gras.)

So, working within that doctrine and custom, there is no conflict between her musicology and her theology. Moreover, Aristotle may have been on to something when he talked about catharsis. Tragedy purges our negative emotionssomething like what women mean when they say they had a good cry.

And it stands to reason that horror can have a similar cathartic, or purgative, or release of emotion. We experience fear and terror in a controlled environmentthe theater, novels, or music videos. And once we have the release of emotion, we can master our feeling.

We can confront of fear of thingsespecially the things that should terrify us: fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. (Matthew 10:28).",1493856000,5

108079,1039,15683,"For most bands from the past, newer releases leave something to be desired.  This, however, is a really strong effort from the Cult.  I won't say it is an equal to their earlier albums (Love, Electric, or even Sonic Temple) but it is a really good album.  Better than their last two efforts.  These guys (Ian Astbury and Billy Duffy) invented ""alternative"" music.  Heavier than their New Wave counterparts, but more soulful, lyrical and smarter than heavy metal, the Cult have always been a bit of an acquired taste, primarily for those who are a bit more hip than the common trends in music.  I think that with Hidden City they solidify their status as Alternative Gods.

It is part of a group of the ""Rise of the Masters"" collections that I purchased for my son's sensory integration therapy. They aren't able to get him to wear headphones for the Auditory Integration Therapy at his occupational therapy clinic, and some studies have indicated the listening to traditional unmodulated classical music can have similar benefits, so I purchased this along with several others.

I bought several of the ""Rise of the Masters"" collections a few years back shortly after our son was diagnosed with his sensory processing disorder.  An OT recommended The Listening Program, but my little man doesn't do headphones.  And everything I looked at study wise on that seemed to be mixed, with some studies indicating that listening to plain classical music alone would produce similar benefits.  So I purchased these to play quietly in the background as we did other things.  Of all of the collections we got, he tolerates Mozart the longest.  I always knew that kid of mine had great taste ;)  The thing that to me is the stand out thing about this product is how many tracks you get for the price, and the quality if fine for what we were using it for.",1494028800,5

108127,17119,11266,"This is one where I'm rating it pretty much based on value.  This is one of 7 ""Rise of the Masters"" Collections I purchased as part of a sensory integration therapy program for our son.  We've been trying to get him to tolerate headphones as part of the OT treatment plan for him.  In the clinic setting it's pretty much not happening at all, at home we occasionally can for short periods of time, but usually not, so it's a hill we've been dying on forever.  So this is a work around it kind of solution, where we were/are trying to do the best we can to support everybody on their/his therapy goals, while working with where our son is at, because as I was looking at the studies for ways to try and make this work for our family I saw that some of them indicated traditional unmodulated classical music can produce similar benefits to the modulated music used as part of the AIT process in occupational therapy. Now the first track on this collection, it starts off very, very quiet.  Which I'm sure he doesn't mind because he has very sensitive hearing, but I have a hard time hearing it, and the first time it played I found myself wondering ""Is this working right?"" but then the volume picks up part way through the track.  We usually don't make it through this collection any further then the first track, because the Romeo and Juliet music has a more tense sound to it, and he struggles more with that in music.  He tends to like things that sound zippy, happy, and upbeat, and isn't a big fan of music that emotes tension, anger, those kinds of things.  So it's not one we get through much on usually, but it's a great value and price point for the number of tracks.",1494028800,5

108131,17119,4598,"I'm starting to sound like a broken record on these.  Again, this is one of 7 ""Rise of the Masters"" collections I purchased as part of a sensory integration therapy program for our son, who has a deeply entrenched dislike of headphones.  Actually, that's an oversimplification.  It would be more accurate to say that they feel radically different on his head then they would to you or I and he  still can't tolerate that sensation well most of the time, and there's probably a sensitivity to sound component in there as well.  Usually the best we can get is for him to allow them around his neck for a short period of time while one of his favorite movies plays on my kindle.  Music generally is too unmotivating to even get him to try and deal with the headphones from his perspective.  Since the type of Auditory Integration Therapy used by my son's OT clinic uses headphones, we've been kind of dying on that hill, but some of the studies into the efficacy of this method for treating sensory issues have indicated that traditional, unmodulated classical music can produce similar benefits.  So we purchased these a while back as a work around it, trying to still get the job done kind of solution and have been quite satisfied with them.  The price point is awesome, which given that we pour money like crazy on therapeutic supports for our son, I am a big, big fan of.",1494028800,5

108133,17119,9020,"This was another ""Rise of the Masters"" purchase I made to support some occupational therapy goals for sensory integration for our son shortly after he was diagnosed with his sensory processing disorder.  Because of the strength of his reactions to things, sometimes I find myself needing to find middle ground no matter how much I admire and respect the therapists who work with him and their recommendations.  Many OT clinics like to do The Listening Program with sensory processing disorder or Autistic kiddos, and our little man does *not* do headphones.  We've been working on it, working on it, working on it...and we have brief periods of time where he will tolerate it, and most of the time he either rips them off his head or gets agitated at the mere sight.  So in looking at the studies on The Listening Program and AIT therapy in general, some of the information indicates that listening to traditional unmodulated classical music can have similar benefits.  So I purchased a whole bunch of these because the price point was great and they were digital and I could access them from multiple devices.  This is the other collection my son will listen to for a longer period of time then the others.  He prefers the Mozart one, but he'll get through more of this one before requesting it be turned off then he will the remainder of them.",1494028800,5

Whatever the initial impression, the music is very easy on the ears, the gruff, midrange vocals going very well with the catchy tunes.

I hate to single out any specific tracks as they're all good and memorable but Sparta, Last Dying Breath, Blood Of Bannockburn, Rorkes Drift, Hill 3234 & Shiroyama particularly stand out.

And its end-credits song fits it perfectly -- a sweet and moving number with gentle but loving vocals and lyrics that fit the story of the film but can still stand well on their own.  It's a fairly low-key number, especially compared to many modern pop songs that seek to overwhelm the listener, but sometimes a low-key song gets its point across better than something bombastic.

Ms Snow's first and foremost talent is that four-octave bluesy contralto that was unique in the 70's and still is today (sadly she passed 6 years ago last month); then there is her unique finger play on ""lead"" acoustic guitar, a velvety touch with lilting grace that hammers at just the right accent spots for making her music style all her own.  Poetry Man is also a one-of-a-kind piece of musical art, it seems to occupy a space somewhere between jazz, folk, and the blues, a space where there seems to be no competition and was simply way ahead of its time.  The closest in musical style you can come to it is Dave Matthews' work, his own being an artistic spot where the three genre experiment with each other, close but not quite like Phoebe Snow.  Her Calypso inflected Beatles cover is also highly unique and Snow just owns it.  One of my favorite songs by my favorite artist, she took it from them and bent it slightly around the middle, making a blues rock composition into a Caribbean gospel folk ballad.  The Gospel Choir never overwhelms Snow's perfect-pitched delivery and her soft-scat coda.  If you download either of these two gems, and you seriously love them (how can you not?) then I urge you with all sincerity to grab hold of the VERY BEST OF PHOEBE SNOW CD.",1494288000,5
108188,6735,1928,"These Red Classics collections are the best idea in yonks from Amazon. A great way for the ""Classical Music Illiterate"" of us to become acquainted with the rock stars of a bygone age. I gave up classical music forty years ago after having it forced down my ears at school relentlessly as the only ""real"" music. I might have actually formed a tolerance or even liking for the stuff had Jazz been part of the indoctrination, or pop. Oh well, water under the bridge.

Other Red Classic collections may have more actual music on them but this one has a complete Suite in chronological order as intended by the composer. Other collections are better thought of as ""samplers"", like the ones we used to have in the early 70s (Transatlantic Years, El Pea etc).

Recommended to young and old alike. Who knows? These Red Classics may kick off a lifetime interest.",1494288000,5

108236,1026,12224,"Ghost is a band that generates as much dislike as the hair metal band back in my teen years. Personally I think Tobias is an excellent musician and songwriter like many musical artists from Sweden. He knows that the Satanic imagery will draw those in who think that maybe they are being a little bad listening to such ""evil"" music. It's been done before with Black Sabbath, Venom, Mercyful Fate/King Diamond, and countless others. He though takes it a bit further with the Papacy. Good for him. Some things like egos, idols, and feelings need to be hurt. That being said Meliora does not disappoint the listener with Ole Pappy delivering the goods. Personally I think this is better than his second effort with more hooks but to each their own. The best part about Ghost is the whole groups of teenage elitists who listen to Death-Black-Funeral-Doom-Grind Metal that think this sucks. I love their ""It's NOT METAL"" attitude. Hey, if it get's a kid to later on dig on some Electric Wizard than I'm all for it. As a teen of the 80's this is nowhere near the level of suckiness we had back than or that garbage they play on the local rock stations. Ghost is a great band and one day you'll get sick of hearing the same Carcass/Obituary song redone for the ten thousandth time and you'll come join us in worshiping Papa.",1494460800,5

108265,7245,6994,"During an initial run of three albums (SITTING IN, LOGGINS & MESSINA, and FULL SAIL), and to a certain extent on a 4th (MOTHER LODE), Kenny Loggins and Jimmy Messina threw down a defining moment of American folk music fused into progressive rock, jazz, and exploratory existential folk musings.  The result was stupendous.  In some ways it outshined their forerunners in the UK (Traffic for example) by being more accessible to various genre and those audiences.  I had all three of the first albums on vinyl, eventually replaced by CD and more recently by remastered reissues, however, during the interim between CD issues, I wanted to avail myself of the best tracks from their progressive side, for my digital listening experiences.  If you want to just pick the absolute best jams that L&M had to offer in long form, these classic rock staples are musical masterpieces:

Trilogy and Same Old Wine from SITTIN' IN
Golden Ribbons and Angry Eyes from LOGGINS & MESSINA
You Need A Man/Coming To You and Pathway To Glory from FULL SAIL

Same Old Wine, The Pathway To Glory, and Golden Ribbons are in particular exemplary classics in the protest music subgenre, Golden Ribbons being one of the most beautiful anti-war cries ever recorded, a three hanky song!  The two former mentions being more traditional protest lyrics wrapped up in some complex progressive rock structures.  Once you listen to these, you might just want to go ahead and grab hold of the full albums digitally or the very well remastered CDs.",1494460800,5

This album is filled with everything I liked most from that one: a strong, bouncy cabaret feel with true, strong emotion lurking beneath the sass and energy.  Particular favorites for this are ""Why Do You Love Me Now?"", ""The Apple Pie and the Knife"", ""The Elephant Song (As Sung by the Ringmaster)"", and ""Definition of Pretty"".  Watching the video for the last is what convinced me to purchase the rest of the album pretty much sight unseen/unheard: a decision I am very glad I made.

108455,9540,17138,"After a recent viewing of ""The Lost Boys"", I realized that this track really adds a nice dimension and feel to the film.  It is creative song in that it does not follow the standard formula that was used for many pop songs back in the 80s (and today), yet it is still incredibly catchy and haunting at the same time.  Listening to this really captures a feel for that time period in a great way.  Funny enough, this track did not make it on the Billboard charts whatsoever, yet it is miles ahead of other popular tracks during that era (and light years ahead of most popular ""music"" today that often consists of a lousy drum loop and a person with no musical ability rapping about some ridiculous topic - yeah, I'm old, what can I say).  I view this as a lost track that should have been a commercial hit, but at least some of us appreciate it and can own it and enjoy it.

108465,6735,15452,"I'm on a voyage of discovery, widening my collection and experience of Prog from the classics of the first generation era I grew up with.

And I found The Astonishing somehow having heard not note one from Dream Theater. Found it, bought it, played it.

Wow. An astounding product in this day and age.

Two disc, two hour plus SF rock opera, composed in a heavy prog-rock style. Epic doesn't begin to describe it.

Excellent quality sound. I can hear most of the lyrics above the instrumental goings-on, which is a bonus. I'm old and my ability to discern one sound from many is sometimes not as good as it should be. Laugh away, whippersnappers, it will come one day to you.

And packaging production the likes of which I haven't seen since the heyday of gatefold vinyl album covers. It made me sad for the days when I'd have been able to look at it taking up three square feet of space when unfolded. Seriously great artwork and graphic design. The art looks like the sort of stuff Riven had in it - not the subject matter, the hi-def art finishing. Brilliant.

The booklet is bound into the cardboard sleeve so the whole is sort of like what you got with Fragile in '71 or Living in the Past. Ha. Irony. This harkens back to the days when albums were multi-media experiences, and the listening was done with the cover open and a lyric sheet to hand.

The story? Well, it's a bit precious but who cares? We are not talking Nebula Award wining SF here, but we know that going in and have no expectations on that score (no pun intended). The playing is virtuoso, the singers in tune (as far as I can tell but I no longer have a perfect musical ear thanks to years of loud noises going in them as often as I could arrange it) and the music melodic with periods of heavy moving in from the west.

And best of all, I'm fairly new to second (and third) generation prog rock, and my last Big Find (Glass Hammer) had a few moments when ""referencing"" other, earlier groups fell into pastiche, derailing the listening experience until I was used to it. Dream Theater sound only like Dream Theater to me. Maybe I am not widely experienced enough in the latter day prog rock scene to say that, but I don't care.

I loved this on first hearing. I don't mind challenging pieces but it was a distinct pleasure to come upon one that required no work just to listen to it (sometimes I'm in the mood, sometimes I'm not).

One of my better discoveries this year.",1494806400,5

108499,6735,19804,"Caveat: I am a huge James Horner soundtrack fan. Please read accordingly.

Another extremely expensive soundtrack remastering from the Star Trek film franchise, this one is actually two albums sailing under one flag.

The first disc has the original film score as it is in the movie, remastered, with the cues at full length.

The second has the remastered original soundtrack, which featured (and still features) alternate versions of some of the cues which Horner actually preferred to the ones used in the film itself.

All this is explained in the lavish booklet, which is a very nice affair, many pages long, with a potted history of the recordings and detailed sections on each cue on the film soundtrack.

The music itself borrows heavily the themes first heard on ""Wrath of Khan"" while tweaking them to give them a new character. It's early days yet, but I think this is going to end up being a contender for my favorite ST soundtrack (currently set to ""Kahn"").

The recording is exquisite, everything a remastering should be. The pieces are restored without heating them so much they drown out details.

And right at the end of the film soundtrack disc is a medley heard  while McCoy is trying to scare up a ride to Genesis. It is a very amusing little piece with deliberately en-blanded muzak versions of classics like ""That Old Black Magic"", ""Tangerine"" and ""I Remember You"".

Expensive, as I said, but worth the cost for me (and a much better experience on first encounter than the movie itself). Five Stars.",1494806400,5

108561,17420,17785,"Fantastic collection from the sneeeeshht mister himself. Growing up, I was a John and George man, being more drawn to songs like The Inner Light, Within Without You, Norwegian Wood and Rain. Especially since the early McCartney cd issues generally sounded like they needed an upgrade (though not as bad as the horrible 80s Beatles cds) I never really dipped into Maccas solo career. With the announcement of the Paul McCartney Archive reissues I started seeing what I had missed. This collection in particular is a really well rounded collection that will have you obsessed with Paul by the end of it. I really wish Call me Back Again and Love in Song (with its Indian/modal sounds like a big inspiration for songs like The Numbers from Radioheads Moon Shaped Pool) from Venus and Mars were collected here as they are among my favorite Paul McCartney numbers ever. Momma Miss America from his debut is an amazing instrument with Paul playing all the instruments and with its White Album vibes definitely deserved a spot on a 4 cd collection. Some notes/reactions to the ditties; Silly Love Songs  Wow, what can I say. I must be getting old and dorky (31) because I love this song. Not that I don't love the LSD days of the aforementioned John and George Songs anymore, but Ive come to love Silly Love Songs. Im not really sure what this song was supposed to be fighting. Paul had just realeased Band on the Run and Venus and Mars and most of these songs and non album singles of the era aren't really little ditties pop songs that Silly Love Songs is a reaction too. Anyways its very much a disco era pop sneessht hit that reaches 6 minutes. Love it. Pipes of Peace a great single with interesting use of table (was pretty surprised to hear table in a 1983 McCaryney single). Listen What the Man Said Another smooth commercial sounding song, I would have dismissed back in the day, but now just comes across as so good, that I want to hear it over and over again. Wanderlust  a great orchestral type song with George Martin producing. The melody is based on a part of Symphony no. 3 by Camille Saint Saens and has been covered by Brian Wilson. This song is from Tug of War this album made me realize I was missing out on not giving Maccas solo career more of a shot. Band on the Run  the closest he got to prog in his solo career.

They ended up becoming Todd Rundgren's back up band in 1970s (check it out on YouTube) although they were a accomplished creative band in their own right! We NEED a box set of all their recordings!

108597,9069,12980,"Produced by The E Street Bands Steven Van Zandt, this CD is nothing but a good time!  The irony in the album title is that that Love is a well-known shadow singer, having sung backups and harmonies for an array of artists including Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, Sonny & Cher, Dionne Warwick, The Beach Boys, and even U2.  Her Christmas (Baby, Please Come Home) is a signature holiday staple, which she reprises each year in a NYC holiday show.  She appeared in 20 Feet from Stardom, the 2013 documentary on the lives of backup singers to the stars.  Love turns 76 this year [2017], and, if this album is any indication, shes about as far from a rocker and a shawl as one can get.  Among the Believers (a Van Zandt original) bangs open the doors, and 13 tracks later, Jesus Is the Rock (That Keeps Me Rollin) (another Van Zandt rant) takes the party home with an all-out gospel shout.  In between, new songs by Linda Perry, Elvis Costello, Jimmy Webb, Barry Mann & Cynthia Weil, and Bruce Springsteen give Love fresh material to make all her own.  The roots of rock and R&B lace through every song on the disc, giving new power to Loves girl-group origins.  But the hands-down highlight is Loves rip through River Deep, Mountain High, which should come with a warning  it will inspire impromptu air-mic moves that could be downright embarrassing, depending on where you hear this.",1494979200,5

With the shocking news of the passing of Chris Cornell of Soundgarden, it is just another tragic reminder of Rock & Roll excess from drugs, alcohol and depression.

108669,14479,7153,"Having read other people's reviews on this latest live album from Van Halen, I feel like putting in my 2 cents' worth as well.  I've been following all of VH's records (including the solo albums by David Lee Roth and Sammy Hagar, respectively) since 1997, and they have gotten better over time.  I desperately wanted to get my hands on any VH album that was available -- whether by vinyl, cassette, or CD.

With the frequent personnel changes (i.e. Roth, Hagar, Cherone, then Roth again, then Wolfgang replacing Michael Anthony), it's a wonder how VH has stayed intact for so long.  But I have to give Eddie Van Halen and brother Alex for STILL having the energy of teenagers to pull off such awe-inspiring, amazing guitar/drum solos.  It really shows on each song.

As for Roth, he's basically off-key and off-balance, ruining many of the songs that make the band famous in the first place (""Unchained"", ""Everybody Wants Some!!"", ""I'll Wait"", ""Romeo Delight""); however, I do give him an A+ for effort and still wanting to rock -- even now in his 60's.  Which is why it saddens me so much that his hot hell yelps, screaming banshee wails, and top octave range are all but GONE.  Still, it doesn't change how I feel about him as an overall individual; he deserves many accolades for the powerhouse voice that he USED to have.

Eddie, on the other hand, went through a very painful divorce with Valerie Bertinelli, dealt with hand surgery, and fired Michael Anthony because the (alleged) reason was that Michael was working with Hagar in his supergroup, Chickenfoot.  Enter, Eddie's son -- Wolfgang Van Halen.  Wolf pulls off all of the moves that Michael had, nearly note for note; you can clearly hear it when he battles it out alongside Eddie's solos and Alex's drums on ""Hot For Teacher"", ""Ice Cream Man"" and ""You Really Got Me.""  Wolf has DEFINITELY got a huge, promising musical career ahead of him.  :)

Of course, Eddie HIMSELF steals the show!!  For anyone that has loved hearing his solos for the past 4 decades, you won't be disappointed here.  The songs where he stands out the most are ""And The Cradle Will Rock..."", ""Panama"", ""Tattoo"", ""Mean Street"", and ""Jump.""  But the HUGE kicker is ""Eruption"" when he starts out with his usual wailing, ear-shattering solo (and deftly battling it out with Alex's fast and furious drumming) before he segues into 1983's ""Cathedral"" from the Diver Down album, then back to ""Eruption"" once again.  He'll definitely go down in history as one of the greatest guitar gods of the 20th/21st century, giving Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton a run for their money.  :)

So where does VH go from here??  Whom really knows, but since I am still a huge superfan of ALL 4 members (PLUS Sammy Hagar and Michael Anthony), I'm still going back to hearing those early records.",1495152000,3

108711,8284,11532,"I am a HUGE Four80East fan and have been for a very long time! I always find their music to be everything I want: funky, groovy, dreamy, jazzy, exotic, silky and very chilled out. All of their albums are among my ""deserted island"" albums - albums you would take with you if you had to live on a deserted island - but POSITRACTION is actually my FAVORITE album they have ever done to date!

It opens with the awesome title track: a dreamy, rhodes-piano-infused upbeat funk groove that you could almost hear on a Jamiroquai or Incognito album (other bands I happen to love). From the opening bars, this is what music is supposed to be. Music that UPLIFTS your day! This is one of those songs you keep hitting repeat on because you never want it to end!

The rest of the album does not disappoint, giving you James Brown type funky jams; dreamy exotic jazz with cool jungle/drum n bass beats; nice electronica mixed with chilled out late-night funk grooves that sound like a smokey NYC alley at 2:00 in the morning; and even some exhilarating upbeat Brazilian samba sounds to boot.

One of the faves on the album is ""Cookie Strut,"" the first radio single from the album. This track is as cool (and smooth) as ice with a soulful R&B beat punctuated by sultry electric piano, hand claps and sweet bluesy guitar riffs. Classic Four80east at its best (!!!!)

I have been spinning this album non-stop since I purchased it and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND you do the same! Four80east just keeps getting better and better and better! Keep up the AWESOME work, guys!!!!",1495238400,5

Can we swim a lake by the ocean, Well be one like drops in slow motion. - Maxwell, Lake By The Ocean.

(Courtesy of Amazon Prime Music)
Five GROOVING Stars. From the 2016 album blackSummersnight, this is the Grammy Award-winning song by the double Grammy-winning singer, songwriter, musician, producer, and actor Maxwell. He has planned his musical career over long periods of time, followed by his eagerly-awaited albums becoming hits and spawning hit singles. Considering the significant gaps of time between them, up to 7 years, including 2 albums from the trilogy with variations of the words blacksummersnight, his artistry has shown bright throughout his career. This album was preceded by the 2009, Grammy-winning album, Blacksummersnight.

On Lake by The Ocean, written by Musze (Maxwell) and Hod David, which won the Grammy for Best R&B Song, Maxwell establishes a definite catchy groove that persists throughout the song and drives the simple, repetitive, but brilliant lyrics. Over a deliberate beat from the urgent drums, Maxwell uses his natural range voice to tell the story, switching to his falsetto voice range to raise the intensity with repetition of the refrain on this song. This song lingers in the mind long after the music has stopped. The musical support group includes the likes of Hod David on bass and other instruments, Robert Glasper on keyboards, Darryl Lil Man Howell or Mark Colenburg on drums, Derrick Hodge on bass, and others. My Highest Recommendation. Five INSISTENT Stars. (Columbia Records. 1-MP3 track. X-Ray lyrics. Time-3:58.)",1495238400,5

I thank this man for all the music he put into this world and for inspiring so many others.  I will never forget how epic he and the other greats were back in the day.  I wish he could have fought off his demons, but maybe this song's title says it all.  So many of us will miss him, RIP.",1495324800,5

108741,3739,12975,"This performance of Beethoven's 9th symphony was recorded December 8-12, 1965, at Sofiensaal in Vienna. I think that it is most notable for the soloists - Joan Sutherland, soprano; Marilyn Horne, mezzo-soprano; James King, tenor; and Martti Talvela, bass - and that was the reason for my purchase. Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt conducts the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, with Chor der Wiener Staatsoper led by Chorus Master Wilhelm Pitz.

The VPO as led by Schmidt-Isserstedt is very good but not as crisp as I prefer, particularly at the end of the first movement where it seemed muddled and the kettle drums were at times lagging the rest of the orchestra. The pace of the performance throughout is more stately than I prefer as well, not quite to the point of plodding, but enough slower that the electricity of the music is

My own personal favorite? That would probably be this recording with Charles Mackerras conducting the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, recorded in the Philharmonic Hall, Liverpool, January, 1991, and with soloists Bryn Terfel, Della Jones, Peter Bronder and Joan Rodgers. It is available in several different listings on Amazon, for example:

Lou Reed strums a relaxed guitar, the drums are played with quietly swinging brushes. It feels like both an intimate after hours gathering on an empty, graffiti-covered subway car, and bedtime story hour at an 'adults only' bookstore. A lullaby for artistic freaks, fiends and friends living in a depraved and dirty, yet stimulating and inspiring city where anything goes. An ode to the characters who came to New York and became part of Andy Warhol's factory crowd. Top it all off with that fantastic saxophone from Ronnie Ross, and the train clickety clacks away down the tracks with dawn just showing in the east.",1495756800,5

109049,8354,1004,"I have a story about the first time I heard Roundabout. I was seven years old, and I was at church camp in the summer of 1974. I slept on a top bunk in a green cabin. Previous occupants had written weird stuff on the ceiling. Anyhow, I didn't like being at camp too much, but there were these hippie junior ministers who played acoustic guitars and had us sing hippie religious songs, like I am the resurrection, and tunes from Godspell. They were pretty cool. They also had a Chevy van with these big speakers that weren't locked down to anything. So, one night we were going somewhere and I got to ride in the van. I got in it and someone put one of the speakers in my lap and said I had to hold onto it. They turned on the stereo and I soon felt an amazing vibration surge through my hands and into my brain and I had no idea what was going on...but it was like some kind of epiphany. I didn't know it was Roundabout at the time. But I recognized it when I eventually heard it again, and I knew it was Chris Squire's Rickenbacker bass that had affected me so much.

That bass comes in at 0:45. It has this woody, round texture, almost like a thick cord of elastic rope, this is what it feels like to me. Rick Wakeman's keyboard riff at 1:53 is pretty dramatic as well. We had a pipe organ at my church, so I probably thought this was another hippie religious song.

109057,8354,6915,"'Houses of the Holy', from the legendary Physical Graffiti album. Don't you wish there was a song called 'Physical Graffiti' on the Houses of the Holy album? I never had Physical Graffiti on vinyl, thus I never had to flip the record. Having the CD means this song can surprise you if you aren't paying attention. 'In My Time of Dying' has a few moments of quiet talk before it completely finishes. Then, bam, the metallic 'Houses of the Holy' guitar jumps right out of your speakers, and if you're playing the album loudly, which of course you should be doing, the effect can be even more dramatic. It has happened to me many times, and I am always amazed. Surprisingly, Led Zeppelin never played this song in concert. Perhaps the opening riff would have shocked the audience. Or the monkey?

109097,18108,9398,"I bought the vinyl with great expectations in '68.  Back then it was pitched as a guitar summit, believe it or not, with Koopers vocals and keyboards added as padding.  One of my first encounters with buyer's remorse.  Don't get me wrong --Bloomfield kept his part of the bargain, more or less.  But he was the only member of the triumvirate who did.

Imagine how great ""Super Session"" could have been if Kooper had jammed with his erstwhile ""discovery,"" Shuggie Otis, instead of Stephen Stills. Shuggie's father was Johnny Otis, a rhythm and blues bandleader of tremendous talent and influence, compared to whom Al Kooper was the flea on the dog.  Shuggie himself was a prodigy -- a skilled guitarist and a fine vocalist, long before he had reached draft age.  It is ironic, to say the least, that he should have required an album like ""Al Kooper Introduces Shuggie Otis"" (released just months before Super Session) to introduce him to (white) baby boomer blueslovers.  The album was a relative flop because it was too much Kooper and his ego, not enough Otis.  A ""super"" jam session, on the other hand, in which Koopers contributions were held on a choke chain, might have served Shuggie far better.  Otiss fluid style would have been an interesting foil for Bloomfields hard-driving Chicago blues.  And his voice would have been a major improvement over Koopers.  Could have been great -- too bad that Columbias brain trust (and perhaps also Kooper) decided that the guitar wah-wah wizardry of Steve Stills was what baby boomer blueslovers needed to hear most of all. Otis never really found his niche outside of his father's band  and friends like Kooper (and later, Stevie Wonder) did not help.

Actually, the packaging of ""Super Session"" was not fair to Stills either.  He was, after all, only a modestly talented folk rocker with a few good Buffalo Springfield tunes behind him.  His role in Buffalo Springfield was for the most part secondary -- Richie Furay was a better singer, and Neil Young was a better song writer and musician.  Stills was just the ""other guy.""  He had no special talent as a player whatsoever, and is remembered these days primarily for the high-schoolish poor-me love song that he wrote, and actually performed publicly, about his unresolved boner for Judy Collins.  His playing on ""Season of the Witch"" is awful  deserving of Kooper's awful vocals.  After Super Session, no one ever again dared to market Stills for his instrumental prowess.

On the other hand, Mike Bloomfield was a great blues guitarist, and too toughened by years of touring with Butterfield to allow himself to be overshadowed by the likes of Al Kooper.  Working with Kooper was like working with rattlesnakes, but Bloomfield pulled it off well enough to produce solid, blues-oriented jamming.  If Super Session had been Bloomfield, and a keyboardist with decent vocal skills, it would be worthy of four enthusiastic stars (as there is nothing in it that comes close to matching ""East-West,"" I wouldnt give it five).  Throw in Stills and Kooper, and four stars drop down to two.  In what respect any of this was ever considered ""super"" is beyond me.  It is more like ""Schizo Session,"" half solid, half a waste of time.",1495843200,2

I gotta hand it to Amazon for the whole music buying experience.
 Back in the day you would hear few songs off a new vinyl album, go over to Tower Records to buy it and find the rest of the songs on it were crap. You would play the good ones until the grooves were worn out, and curse yourself for not just buying the singles, and a side benefit is all those albums took up A BUNCH of space!
 CDs didn't wear out but still were STILL quite bulky, and you STILL ended up with a bunch of music you would NEVER listen to again.

'Nuf said).

However, why weren't such bonus cut added to this as the Extended versions of ""Handle With Care"" and ""End of the Line""?  Why no ""Runaway""?  Why no ""remix"" of Roy Orbison's solo on ""Not Alone Any More""?

I smell an even more extensive reissue about 10 years down the road, with all of the aforementioned ""missing"" tracks.  Leave it to record companies to ruin a good thing, and they wonder why people steal music.

109165,18120,538,"I would put 5/5 stars ,but the sound quality in some of the tracks is not that good .Actually there are 3 or 4 tracks that have a fairly BAD quality and tracks such as ""International Smile"" or ""It Takes Two"" whose quality is TE RRI BLE .So 1/3 of the whole LP is sadly of a bad quality .

Another problem is that the picture record sleeves (which look AMAZING) are made out of cardboard and cardboard is NOT a good material for record sleeves .

The tracks themselves are really good and the album is amazing as a whole .

The LP's representation is well thought and definitely of a good quality .

If it weren't for the bad sound quality in almost half of the tracks ,this album definitely would have gotten 5 stars from me .",1496016000,3
109166,8354,20391,"I was twelve when I first heard this at a friend's house. I listened through headphones. It felt like I was in some sort of loud thrilling electric church. I'm sure I just sat there with my mouth open. My friend let me borrow this album, and I let him borrow my copy of Genesis' Duke. I still have his copy of Van Halen.

Eruption is pretty much all about what happens after the 25 second intro, when it becomes a pure electric guitar tornado of classical music style. This is the church part of it, it reminds me of the organist I grew up listening to at First Presbyterian.

Favorite moments:

All of the recordings in the ""red and gold"" covered CDs have been beautifully remastered, with the analog sound quality as good as any symphonic recording made today (maybe better in some ways), and this one is no exception. The actor-focused albums of ""Classic film scores for... Bette Davis/Humphrey Bogart/Errol Flynn"" include music by multiple composers presumably to get the sound background associated with those actors. Also check out the composer-based CDs for the composers named above (and others). Charles Gerhardt conducts the ""National Philharmonic Orchestra"" which is made up of the best musicians from among London's 5 major symphony orchestras.

This song came on a lot through the radio loudspeakers. It had been reissued that year as a single. I didn't find out that the song was originally from 1966 until a few years later.

This may be my favorite song of Paul's. His voice is amazing. The horns are so dramatic, and they have a unique texture to them. They remind me of the opening horns in Stevie Wonder's 'Sir Duke'. The other part of the song I like is George's guitar at the end, it is magical and brilliant.",1496102400,5

109230,8354,18625,"Sometime around 1978 my Mom got me the Red album and Doug got the Blue Album, or at least that is how we adopted them. I used to sit in our comfy brown swivel chair next to the stereo with the headphones on and read the lyrics and look at the gatefold photo. I'd sit there and wonder how the one kid got to be on the other side of the fence. And the kid in the middle looked sad and kind of out of place, but he seemed pretty cool, too. I always liked how Ringo was at kid height, all hunkered down. The lyrics to the songs were printed on the sleeves, so you could follow along. I really liked Paperback Writer because it told a story and I liked books, and it wasn't about girls and all that hold your hand stuff. The way the vocals cascade all over themselves from the top, and the way they echo around after writererererer....so trippy .The guitar riff is great, but i don't think I appreciated it at the time. I could also imagine the Monkees doing this one, my favorite lunch time entertainers. Anyhow, it's a fun Paul song. I don't think John would have written a song that began with 'Dear Sir or Madam.'",1496102400,5

109240,8354,17992,"A classic tune from the British Invasion, although I think this song was more popular in Great Britain than the US. Van Morrison is in fine form on this one. 'Whoa oa yeah' (1:37). The song opens with a bang, starting off with that great ringing guitar chord and the all the guys belting it out on the chorus. The verses are choppy little two steps, the narrator telling his story of woe as his former girlfriend walks past his house with 'another guy-e-ay.' Night falls and he's all alone and imagines she is telling her new guy all the nice things she once told him.

The chorus is such a smash, the drums are fantastic, I especially like the long fill around 2:35 during the fade out. And how about the primary five note guitar riff? Classic.",1496102400,5

109245,8354,2939,"This is probably one of the most significant songs in the history of rock n roll. Those opening two notes grab hold of you, and then Elvis bursts through the speakers. I don't think I ever knew all the correct lyrics until today. I never knew there was a 'drummer boy from Illinois'. It didn't matter to me, since it was all about the overall feeling of the song. I knew it was about a party in the jail and all the inmates having a good time. It was a pretty good movie too, as far as Elvis movies go.",1496102400,5

Well, I think in most cases time heals all wounds and the narrator will recover, but at the moment he is distraught, barely keeping it together.

Musically, everything hangs in there with Roy, gently walking along with him, building up with him to the emotional end. Angelic choir, strings, tom toms, marimba, I wonder how Joe Meek would have recorded this.",1496102400,5

I believe it's the scene that shows them driving across rain-washed country roads, trying to stay a step ahead of the law. I loved Israelites immediately, especially the guitar scale that ends the chorus (e.g., 0:32), it seemed comically out of place to me, it went in this direction that wasn't completely unexpected but seemed unusual, it felt awkward in a playful way. Plus there's this weird low voice moaning right before that so I'm already about to laugh. Anyhow, totally cool guitar riff. Plus, the opening rhythm gets your ears set up but then it drops into rocksteady territory. Throughout all of this, Desmond Dekker's voice is amazing, that soulful sharp stiletto falsetto sounds so pure, like cool water.",1496102400,5

109276,8354,10839,"What to say about this one? It's a classic instrumental one hit wonder, the archetypal breezy cheezy 70s pop AM radio hit. I love the fade in, the organ, and the rhythm guitar. I especially love the electric guitar solo, it has that recorded in a cave reverb quality. Not crazy about the horns during the song, but I love them during the build up at the end. And the tiny one second drum break around 2:01 is cool. I don't know if Bach would have liked it, but I think it's a pretty cool arrangement and from a long gone era in pop music when hit songs were allowed to be unapologetically geeky and joyful.",1496102400,5

109312,18131,18767,"I say so because if you lay out the 3-decade career of this most intelligent band you'll hear a rarity in American musical traditions (with the exception of their annoying Industrial pre-Jarboe works): Genius. This Isn't rock n roll anymore; it's some so much more powerful: a new type of Classical Music. Swans are sublimely power and overwhelming. All their works need to be turned up to 11. I will start finishing up buying the rest of my Swans cds once I've completed finishing buying up a surf music collection for the research for my wife's upcoming 3-edition book collection of instrumental (and therefore authentic) Music. But that's another story.
  Buy THIS and all other Swans music in any form. This music will stay with you the rest of your lives.
  P.S. The other Most Important Band Of The 20th Century was The Stooges. Do your research. Be intelligent. Use your brain.",1496188800,5

This song has some really cool moments from Ringo and Paul; Ringo's quick rolls at :33 on 'into the shade' and at :45 in the way he extends the drum fill beyond the end of 'when the sun shines', and Paul's bass line at 1:18 during the 'I can show you' verse. And then at the end we get the 'let's play stuff backwards' moment. I always think John's vocals sound like 'still drippin on memory...' Bring on the April showers.",1496188800,5

If tomorrow never knows, then today knows? And yesterday always knows? or knew? Future, present, past. It all merges together here in a big psychedelic daydream. Drums and bass lay down the groove, weird screechy birds swoop around, play everything backwards, John sounds like he's flying all around us in a state of pure cosmic energy. We could be in prehistoric times running around with dinosaurs, or cruising through another galaxy in a rocket, or in a comfortable room at home.

Smokey sounds so disconcerted and helpless, admitting to his now ex-gf that, although he looks content on the outside, he is really lost without her. The Funk Brothers lay down the groove.

However, the first eight tracks sound strident, and I question the necessity of playing so extremely loud, which makes it unpleasant to listen to.  And the first eight tracks have minimal melody.

""liberal is another pointless remark thrown around a lot.... first of all Waters has always been upfront in his lyrics on his views ..... hes 70 something and not much has changed ! He has made a timely album in my opinion and one of his best solo releases ... I have never cared much for his solo efforts though the Final cut was really a solo effort and I love that album.. Here Waters has the help of Radiohead producer Nigel Goodrich and hes abandoned the trademark guitar solo breaks which personally I'm glad as those days are dead and gone... I love David Gilmour but the formula grew tired in the early 1980s... I for one like the spoken words bits -- sound collages samples  and decision to try new ideas in breaks and endings! Overall -- its not happy listening but it makes its point and some of it is haunting and up there with some of the classic 70s PF material .. I hear hints of animals wish you were here and the final cut for sure ... all good things to my ears! Production wise its a little compressed id agree but not to the point of the album being ruined .... There wasn't a song I disliked or that was offputting and that's a first for his solo albums ....  Overall 4.5 stars as some of the sound does sound compressed and I would prefer a hard case cd version but this is minor complaints .. certainly not complaining that Waters has a liberal life view like some of these clowns on here who apparently voted for Trump and his wall!!",1496361600,4

109462,8354,7366,"This song always makes me think of being a kid in 1976 and riding in the back seat of the family station wagon at night, after a swim meet. My Mom would have the radio on and I would lay down and watch as the various neon lights of fast food chains were reflected on the window. We might head to McDonalds for some 'food' or a 'milkshake'. There is a down to earth late night quality to this song, the reverb on the vocals and music, the simple jangly guitar chords, the drum fills. I always liked the name-checking of the various cities in the US - Phoenix, Tacoma, Philadelphia, Atlanta, LA. When I got older I often wondered why Tacoma was included, since it's way smaller than the other ones. I thought it might have been a nod to the Tacoma Dome, but that wasn't constructed until 1983. It must be that it sort of rhymes with Arizona. Arizona - Tacoma - Oklahoma - Bologna. Catchy stuff, Steve Miller. He includes all of northern California in his lyrics. Why limit himself to one city when 'the girls are warm' in an entire area? There were probably a lot of girls in northern Cali who heard this song and thought, ""Hey, I live in northern California and I'm warm. He's singing about me!""",1496361600,5

I have never been to Lodi, but it is apparently the ''Zinfandel Capital of the World."" You end up sipping some wine and before you know it you are a resident.

The high points of this disk are  ""Smell the roses"", a distinct nod to past Floyd brilliance, Then ""Oceans apart which transcends into Wait for her,

I have not received my vinyl yer but i have streamed it here today and I liked it right off the back. I will update if the wax comes warped or anything else like Ive been reading here.

109477,3574,20400,"It goes without saying that Roger Waters is a lyrical genius, and his latest work is no exception.  This is one of those albums that you really need to sit down with the lyrics and actually pay attention to what is being said.  It doesn't really work as simple background music while you're driving to work.  Much like ""Amused to Death"", Waters has nothing positive to say about our political leaders and the military industrial machine.  He clearly despises Trump, and it comes out numerous times throughout the album, including quotes from the orange fool himself.  ""Picture That"" is particularly vitriolic, as is the title track.

Unfortunately, as great as the lyrics are, the music is rather mediocre.  Pink Floyd fans will notice that ""Deja Vu"" has elements of ""Mother.""  ""Picture That"" sounds a lot like ""Sheep"" and ""Smell the Roses"" is basically a ""Have a Cigar"" rewrite.  Those are some of the highlights here.  What's really lacking though is the guitar punch of previous albums.  ""The Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking"" had Eric Clapton and ""Amused to Death"" had Jeff Beck.  Not only does this album not have a great guitar player, it doesn't feature any memorable solos.  Many of the songs are acoustic with pretty simple arrangements.

If you're a Pink Floyd fan and are expecting another ""Dark Side"" or ""Wish You Were Here,"" you're going to be disappointed.  I'd recommend you get David Gilmour's last album instead.  If you loved ""The Final Cut"", though, you'll probably dig this.",1496361600,4

The setting just looked so dreary with a bit of anxiety thanks to the expressions of the band members, and perhaps my beat up/bad picture quality TV elevated the dreary vibes.  This song is truly nostalgic for me.  With that said it took me years to actually appreciate the melody.  The verse melody is stellar (which I didn't realize at the time and warmed up to it a lot more in recent years) and the chorus is pretty awesome too.",1496448000,4
109497,5355,10290,"When I first learned about this release  recently available in the US via Music Video Distributors  I didn't release that this British release was issued in the UK last year and that there were reviews up here already.  But, Ill add mine here too because I do have some local connections to the concert on this CD. And, I do feel that it can be recommended to all Joni fans as well as anyone hanging around Philadelphias Rittenhouse Square in the 1960s and listening every Sunday night to The Folk Show with Gene Shay (the dean of Folk DJs who only retired from the air a year ago.).

The location of this live concert which was broadcast from Temple Universitys student-run radio station  WRTI  was one of Phillys venerable coffee houses  The Second Fret (now long gone) on Sansom Street. After performances many of the artists would head to Genes show for interviews. I distinctly remember when Joni was still married to her husband Chuck and both would play live on Genes show.

Anyway, back to the CD at hand. No, it is not high fidelity, but its still easy to listen to. The club was SMALL and so there always was some sort of echo, which youll hear on this disc. But, there are four song that Joni never recorded as studio recordings. The full concert is here  79-minutes worth!  and the recording includes her spoken intros  which were often lengthy. The intros are NOT indexed but come AFTER the previous song is sung.

My friend, retired professor Mike Biel, worked at WRTI in those days and told me that he helped engineer this broadcast.
This 1966 gig was two years before her first album release so you get to hear her (now) well-known songs in their early stages. And its just Joni playing here. No other musicians.

I don't know the source of this recording, but Im sure glad it was released. As I said, the sound is okay (and Im sure there are no better copies out there  these cannot be remastered). So, if you are a big Joni fan  or one of the mid-1960s Philly folkies like me, youll want to hear this.

UI hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

109499,14947,13242,"I cant believe Im writing this after all the drama and a string of, at best, mediocre and forgettable albums but Queensryche has had a resurgence in recent years. Much of that has to do with throwing longtime senior Geoff Tate overboard and bringing on Todd La Torre to replace him.

Two years after releasing a self-titled album in 2013, Queensryche offered another excellent effort in Condition Human. The album starts out strong with Arrow of Time and Guardian, high octane tracks which sound like they could have been from the bands early days. As the album continues along, there are enough tracks that most progressive metal fans and longtime Queensryche supporters should enjoy what they here. Even the slower tracks get on base though, admittedly, there are a lot of doubles and triples here instead of a bunch of home runs.

The new incarnation of the band has matured since its 2013 outing and La Torre has grown, sounding less like Tate and finding his unique niche in the band. The band is in great form here with strong work from Scott Rockendield on drums, Michael Wilton and Park Lundgren on guitar and Eddie Jackson on bass.

Theres far more energy and enthusiasm here than in most of the bands recent efforts and that makes this the best album the band has crafted in decades. Even without anything as stellar as their best songs from Rage for Order or Operation Mindcrime or Empire, this is still a great album. Highly recommended.",1496448000,5

The tenderness of the vocals and the gentle melody instantly made me think of Belinda Carlisle.  I admit I was wrong, and I can't believe how wrong I was.  I usually don't make big mistakes when identifying artists is the subject.  Even back in the 80's somehow I never realized ""All Through the Night"" was by Cyndi Lauper.  It's just a different (normal) singing style that I don't normally associate with Cyndi.  A *fabulous* song though!  Absolutely love it!

""Right Here, Right Now"" is as if Donna Summer and Kylie Minogue had birthed a baby together it combines Moroder's modern electro-disco with Kylie Minogue's effervescent and buoyant pop music. Its feel good lyrics (which is very Kylie) and great dance beats makes you just want to dance and possibly singalong to the music.

109542,18159,20400,"This is probably Roger Waters' best solo album because it sounds so much like Pink Floyd. Similar sounds, lyrical content and even sound effects that were used on Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals, The Wall and The Final Cut are used again.

Many of the same, sinister forces that Waters' has been railing against for the past 50 years are still present: jingoism, nationalism, greed, broken politics, racism, fear-mongering, etc. I guess this is why the music is so similar to his past work. Is This The Life We Really Want? Roger has concluded that it is because nothing has changed.

The real musical revelation is session drummer Joey Waronker. Every note he plays is so tight and perfect. I'll check out his other work.

Joe Pug is a folk singer/songwriter.  the singer and the songs were pleasant enough, thou nothing to write home about. not unlike many other artists i've listened to in the past. i did give the disc a few more spins hoping i may change my mind but to no avail. my biggest concern was that the music just wasn't varied enough. most songs had a similar beat and chord / song structure. it just didn't have any sort've discernable WOW factor. just very real bland and boring. i gave it 3 stars because the music is technically proficient just uninteresting, atleast to me. but hey, that's just me. i seem to be in the minority. to each is own.",1496534400,3

109546,1332,20400,"I have to confess at being a little surprised when I found out that Nigel Godrich was going to produce Waters new album, as he has a reputation as being a bit of a hard task master (When Godrich produced Paul McCartneys Chaos & Creation album, he would make Macca going away & work some more  if he thought the songs he had written wasn't good enough), but even though Roger is single minded to say the least, the Godrich/Waters dynamic has bore some excellent fruit.
As the title eludes to, Is this the life.. is a bleak & stark affair, with dystopian themes running throughout the entire album & Waters aged voice adding extra gravitas.
The only criticism that I have, is occasionally Walters does sound a little like a one-trick-pony & theres a fair bit of effing & jeffing which I don't think he needed to resort to make a his  various points.
So unlike his musical nemesis David Gilmour Is this the life.. probably won't be troubling the top end of the hit parade, but I don't think that will bother Waters one bit, as his has created an album that mirrors the mood & the state of the world at the present to a tee, fascinating.",1496534400,4

But now I seem to realize that time has done this song *very* well and I'm able to appreciate it with open ears. The melody is actually really stellar and well-written.  I was too obsessed disliking the singer's voice (Shannon Hoon) to notice the melody back in 1992.  I look back and think Shannon Hoon's singing style was a little ahead of its time.  I wasn't prepared for it.  Now I find myself singing the line ""All I can say is that my life is pretty plain, you don't like my point of view you think that I'm insane!"" all the time!",1496620800,5

I knew nothing of Ms. Lisitsa or her playing - I can't even remember how I found the CD listing but I'm glad I did.  When I was a tyke I was obsessed with the Warsaw Concerto - I loved it and bought every version I could find on LP.  And the same for CD.  I always love the piece, of course, and I have loved some of the bands and soloists who've played it - but I've never found a great-sounding performance, meaning technically great sounding.  Until now.  Now we have a perfectly played and just as importantly, perfectly recorded performance.  This is beautifully engineered.  I must take exception with the fellow who said the piano is overpowered by the band - not so - balances are fine.  And this is how you record an orchestra - up close and personal and none of that washy, distant sound where all orchestral detail is lost in a haze of whatever.

Fred Hammond (& Radical For Christ) is my immediate go-to for uplifting ministry through song. Having said that, I think this album has quickly become my favorite from his entire repertoire. The energy from the audience is surely felt and even the slower arrangements are extremely powerful because of the lyrics. His background vocalists are ALWAYS on harmonic point.

109652,9583,16369,"Really wanted to like this cd, had high hopes. Bought the deluxe version for the extra tracks and immediately put it in my truck. The sound is what i have always loved from 3DD, heavy base drums, good guitar, riffs etc .. but even after weeks of listening i just don't find myself actually liking any of the songs or wanting to hear them when i get in the truck.
the test comes after that first week when i punch back over to the radio or my phone or whatever .. do i catch myself thinking about track number .. whatever .. and wanting to hear it? .. well, i didnt.
after a week sitting in the player i had forgotten all about it .. i ran it through again and even though i knew the words to a few tracks now, i just wasn't feeling it .. i would normally say something like ""uninspired"" or something like that, but i know these guys don't just put down music for no reason .. so all i can say is that i am not feeling it.
pulled it out friday to put the new Saving Abel in and the final test was that none of the songs from this disc made their way over to my ipod .. it went on the shelf with all my other 3DD discs and will probably stay there .. first and only release of theirs not represented in my ipod at the moment .. disappointed.
its not bad music .. its good rock .. just nothing exceptional or memorable for me.. not what i had hoped for ..",1496707200,3

109668,16842,12815,"It's not unusual considering the times that a reviewer might remember ( if that was possible in the 60's) a group as being exceptional. It could well be the influence  ofall  unmentionable substances that were ingested at the time, or perhaps for that time they stood out somewhat from the rest of the pack. Whatever it was, it certainly didn't get captured any other way except "" live,"" as this disc pretty clearly shows.
  l happened to see Blind Faith with the opening act being Taste with Rory Gallagher in Portland,OR a few years back ( snicker, snicker). Blind Faith was the group we originally went to see, but they were obviously disintegrating. The otherwise unknownand opening act, Taste , was exceptional beyond comparison to anyone else out there at the time.  "" On The Boards"" barely captures  the breathtakingly exciting Jazz/ Blues/ Rock they played that night. It was, hands down, the best band I have ever seen "" live"" except for the Crayhawks ( one of the many incarnations of Robert Cray w/ Curtis Salgado). Anyway, "" On The Boards"" is still a landmark album whereas "" If It's So"" will disappear in obscurity long before. Some things are just better off being a nice memory.

109672,8354,16079,"One night in 1991 I lay down on the floor with my big headphones on and listened to this song. I had a musical epiphany because I was really locked in to Paul's bass. It was almost like I was hearing it for the first time, especially on the fade out chorus. I'd always appreciated his playing, but this time it really hit me how great it truly is.
I love when John's vocals take on that faraway hue on 'cellophane flowers...', it's like OK, Dorothy opened the door from her black and white world and entered the colorful land of Oz. Well, in this song, we start out already in Oz and on the cellophane part we open a door into an even more amazing land - John's imagination! This is psychedelic pop at its best.

109687,8354,10813,"1971 was a great year for soul music. You had Shaft, What's Going On, Al Green Gets Next To You. Lots of cool orchestral soul. The Dramatics were from Detroit...such a great city for rock and soul of the early 70s. There are so many things to like about Whatcha See Is Whatcha Get. Let's go through it...

1) nice rhythm guitar punctuated with strings and horns during intro.
2) Great vocal variety, especially love high pitched voice 'some people are made of wood' and lower voice guy 'some people are up to no good'. Very Temptationsesque.
3) fuzz electric guitar comes in at 0:40
4) lots of excellent ahs, hahs, huhs, heys, other various grunts and stuff...see 0:37, 1:02, 1:33-1:35, etc.
5) 1:15-1:20 rough main vocals on 'I said what you see' especially on 'what'...then nice falsetto on 'baby'
6) 1:41-1:42 'people'...soul!!!
7) 3:01 piccolo? marching band music now...",1496793600,5

While some people might only love him sometime I love him ALL the time and my 5 children love him too even though they were young when he died. Funny think is my dad looked like him and when my kids would see Dean in a movie on TV they would cry out ""There's Bop Bop!"" which was their name for my dad! Sweet Memories!",1496793600,5
109689,8354,7819,"Don't you just love the way Damo Suzuki says 'vitamin C'? I chuckle with glee when I hear it. So cute. The song has a very sudden start. Just some great Holger Czukay bass and Jaki's drums and then Damo comes swooping in with his whispery little Japanese English voice. Don't lose YOUR vitamin C! Eat your broccoli! And finally the song dissolves into crazy electronic spider talk. Guess this is what happens when you lose your Vitamin C. I don't lose mine, I eat these yummy chewy Vitamin C gummies every morning. It's kind of like eating a chuckles, but it tastes better. Well, I haven't had a chuckles in at least 30 years so I don't remember what they're like. Were they like gumdrops?",1496793600,5

I also like near the end, when Johns primary vocals quiet down as the rest of the chorus powers on.

109711,8354,20419,"Bursting out of the gate like a mini Born to Run, it's obvious that we have an urgent message before us. This is my favorite Elvis Costello vocal, it's got that deep husky tone with the threat of maybe coughing up phlegm quality to it. I don't know, anyone else hear that? Like he might have a slight cold or adenoidal issue going on.

This song was written by Nick Lowe, I heard an interview with him on NPR a couple years ago, seems like a very cool guy. Well, he's the Jesus of Cool, isn't he? The lyrics express the frustration of living in a world that can often feel cruel and insensitive, insane and disturbing, ignorant and unjust. Why do things have to suck? Why are there people who want power and view life as a game to win and have the desire to keep everything for themselves? Those are the people who think peace love and understanding are funny. Abnormal funny, not ha ha funny. Stay away from me, you stinkin hippie commie, go get a job if you want any understanding from me! Yeah, it's easy to feel small and helpless in this kind of society, you can wonder when the saviors will arrive who will turn things into a utopia, or you can go out and create your own reality and live as though peace love and understanding are all around you. It is really hard to find that sort of courage, but people have achieved this level and someday I hope to also. It's funny 'cause it's true.",1496793600,5

109727,18,638,"I recently saw Frazey Ford in concert (more on that later). The (erstwhile?) member of the great Be Good Tanyas has been quite active since the Be Good Tanyas went on (forever?) hiatus in 2007. Ford issued a well-received solo album in 2010 with ""Obadiah' and the followed that up with this album in 2014.

""Indian Ocean"" (11 tracks including the ""hidden"" bonus track; 47 min.)  opens with ""September Fields"", about as accessible as anything Ford has done before. Immediately apparent in the sound are the warm horns. Turns out this is non other than the legendary Hi Rhythm Section, holy cow! Things slow down a bit on ""You're Free"". The album has a pretty nice overall R&B feel to it, check out ""Done"" (1st radio single) as a great example. Side B opens with the deceptively slow ""You Got Religion"". Another highlight deeper into the album is the hard-charging ""Natural Law"". But it all leads to the epic (and album-closing) title track, a 6+ min. journey (with observations like ""You come again and again/And you, you're sorry/You're sorry/For what you've done""). The ""hidden track ""September Fields"" is an acoustic version of the album's opening song, just Frazey and her guitar. Bottom line: this is a delightful album on many levels. I have no idea whether the Be Good Tanyas will ever come together again, but it's clear that Frazey Ford has found her own path and voice.

Just this past weekend I saw Frazey Ford in concert at the beautiful Nelsonville Music Fest here in Ohio. Ford and her band played an hour long set in the late afternoon on the main stage, and the crowd absolutely loved her. She played mostly from ""Indian Ocean"" but also a couple of tunes that I didn't recognize and am quite certain these are new songs. Given that it took her 4 years between the first and second solo album, here's hoping we'll get a new album next year (at the latest!). If you have a chance to see Frazey Ford live, don't miss her!",1496880000,4

109779,2768,18210,"Mark Lindsay (of Paul Revere and the Raiders) and Susan Cowsill (of the Cowsills) are paired perfectly on this CD. The songs are from the 60s' and there is one song written by Mark. The highlights of this CD are ""You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling"" (the first time I've heard it sung by a man and woman), and Bobby Darin's ""Dream Lover"". The only complaint I have is that there are only 6 songs; 4 more would have made it better.

109786,13808,20400,"Would you rather have a Roger Waters or Lady Gaga or Katy Perry album? For a 70 plus year old musician, we are fortunate to have RW making albums and performing live. With the present kind of music that we have to go through, an album from a veteran rocker like Roger is welcoming.  If you are into the sound and style of any Pink Floyd member then this is a must have. RW has earned a reputation for bluntly or sublimely attacking in his songs current infamous figures who are contributing to the misery of society. Yes there are some ranting but this should not dissuade the listener from owning the album, the music is what really matters.  You will end up with a smile to hear some songs close to sheep, shine on crazy diamond, have a cigar and other Floyd classic. The album is over 60 minutes, a booklet with the lyrics and comes in an LP replica sleeve. Thank you Roger Waters for the music and it was worth the long wait.",1496966400,5

109807,8354,7271,"I've loved this song since I was nine years old and heard it being blasted out of a high school neighbor's bedroom window during the summer of 1976. I was often in the vicinity of that house, playing with other kids, and there was always a radio on somewhere..

The Boys Are Back in Town is a straight up rock classic. It features the twin lead guitars of Scott Gorham and Brian Robertson, bass and lead vocals by the late great ultra-talented Dubliner Phil Lynott. Look him up on youtube, there are at least two pretty cool documentaries about him. Lyrically and vocally, it always felt to me like an American Bruce Springsteen New Jersey kind of song, to wit:

And that time over at Johnny's place,
Well, this chick got up and she slapped Johnny's face
Man, we just fell about the place
If that chick don't want to know, forget her

I just picture Miller Lite neon signs and Chevys and baseball on the tv...down at Dino's, ya know? Hey, fuhgitaboutit.",1497052800,5
109808,8354,11100,"This is one of the few Led Zeppelin tunes to actually make reference to the Lord of the Rings:

in the darkest depths of Mordor
I met a girl so fair
But Gollum, and the evil one crept up
And slipped away with her

Battle of Evermore. Misty Mountain Hop also. Some LZ fans want every song to be about Lord of the Rings: 'hey dude, that song Hot Dog? It's about the hobbits wanting to enjoy some elevensies, you know, have a little snack after traveling so far.'

This is also one of their Light and Shade songs, featuring gentle acoustic guitars giving way to heavy electric guitars.

Something like that. Ramble On is also one of your Robert Plant double tracked vocal songs. You can hear it mostly at the end, it's like there are two Roberts singing, separate but equal. You can also hear this phenomenon in songs like Babe I'm Gonna Leave You and Whole Lotta Love.",1497052800,5

Electronic drum explosions, bubbling cauldrons, the siren that blares fire! fire! get out!, drum explosions become more intense....and one of my favorite outros. It just keeps going with those drum fills and piled on synth harmonics. Ear candy.",1497052800,5
109812,8354,387,"Jimi Hendrix took this Bob Dylan tune and turned it into his own monumentally panoramically spaghetti westernly classic. Brian Jones on the vibraslap at the end of each opening bar, makes me think of Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef calmly sizing each other up in some dusty lawless town. I never knew Brian Jones played on this, what a bittersweet discovery. Wow, Dave Mason too? Argghhh, can't believe I didn't know this...well, glad to know it now.

The story unfolds....the joker speaks to the thief about his troubles. The blues. Life is a drag. He finishes his words at 0:52 and Jimi cranks out a nice solo in solidarity. At 1:09, the thief 'kindly' speaks. He can sympathize and says there are 'many here among us who feel that life is but a joke.' But he says, let's not talk about this tonight, it's getting late.

1:43 - so the joker and thief wander off into the night, Jimi blazing a trail for them to follow. At 2:00 they fall asleep and are swept off into some sort of dream land (my favorite part). At 2:17 they wake from their slumber and realize they aren't quite sure where they are. A wah wah chaos of tumbleweeds and dust encircles them as they attempt to get their situation in order. 2:33 - back on some trail, with a growing sense of urgency.

2:50 - The joker and the thief have traveled over distance and time, and now out of nowhere they approach a fortress of princes, damsels, servants, possibly various other court attendants, who may have been aware of them for awhile, observing them from the watchtower. But they are not there yet. They must deal with growling wildcats and howling winds. I've always preferred a happy ending - they finally make it to the castle and are welcomed with hearty meals and bowls of mead.",1497052800,5

Dave Mason composed and sings on this early Traffic tune. Starts off with acoustic guitar, light drums and piano. It's built around two chords, C and F, along with their corresponding 7ths. Steve Winwood fills it up with bouncy jazz piano, Jim Capaldi plays swinging unobtrusive drums, Chris Wood gets in a great sax solo starting at 1:43 or so.

Janis Joplin's 'Summertime' begins like someone is lazily stretching out after an afternoon nap, curtain blowing lightly, sunshine and a cool breeze. Janis sings with such laid-back soul, her voice rising and falling with the music. The interplay of guitarists Sam Andrew and James Gurley is the classic Haight Ashbury sound of the 60s.",1497052800,5
109821,8354,562,"That opening moment is like a punch in the gut. What an intense song! A dramatic first 15 seconds, very intense and focused, then hurricane Janis roars in with the 'come on' vocals before taking it down into the first verse. But soon her intensity is back up and she is screaming out pain and suffering at the hands of the man she loves with abandon, but he treats her like you know what.  She's like, 'fine, keep crushing my heart if it makes you feel better', but she still can't bring herself to leave him. It's like an anti-torch song, or more like a flame thrower song. I like when Sam Andrew comes in with his vocals on the chorus. His guitar solos are awesome too.",1497052800,5

Turn to Stone features all the common ELO accoutrements: great hooks, magical baroque/Beatlesesque string arrangements, high falsetto harmonies, interesting synthesizers and effects. I like this one for the 13 second descending metallic fade in, the driving beat, the strings throughout, the weird middle fast spoken bit, the little 'day in the life' outro, the imagery, e.g. 'the tired streets that hide away.' It's a song like the Beatles's 'Misery' - the lyrics tell a story of self-pity and hopelessness, but the music sounds otherwise. No point in 'bringing us down' too much, eh Jeff?

109831,8354,2332,"'Everything is everything.' I love the friendly chatter that opens this sweet tune. What's Going On was co-written by Renaldo 'Obie' Benson, a member of the Four Tops, Motown songwriter Al Cleveland, and Marvin Gaye. Benson had witnessed police brutality in Berkeley and was really shook up by it. He began to ask himself all sorts of questions, like why were kids being sent off to Vietnam? and why were kids being beaten at home? Marvin Gaye was asking himself, with all the problems going on in my country, how am I supposed to keep singing love songs? The song is a plea for people to talk with each other and explore alternatives to war and violence. 'For only love can conquer hate.' It's amazing to me that this song is still relevant all these years later. Will our world ever evolve to the kind of existence that everyone can enjoy?

Musically, I've always loved the drums. Marvin Gaye played a box drum accompaniment to the regular drums, producing this oversized ping pong ball quality. The saxophone opening is a classic. The legendary James Jamerson played the bass while laying on the floor. Excellent string arrangement.",1497052800,5

109834,8354,16080,"There are so many great songs in existence, and if I had to pick one as my all time favorite, it would be Strawberry Fields Forever. It encompasses everything I love about pop music: dreamy lyrical imagery, moments of transcendent creative beauty, emotional impact, and of course certain intangibles that exist on a purely personal level. This is among the peaks of the creative union between the Beatles and George Martin. John Lennon wrote the song, but Martin added all the orchestration, spliced the tapes, mixed it all into a finished work of art.

There are a number of particular moments I love:
1) Guitar from 0:18-0:22
2) Guitar during second verse from 0:40-0:54
3) Drums from left speaker 1:00-1:10+, 1:44-2:00+, and 3:00+
4) Horn riff from 1:10-1:13, etc.
5) backward percussion after 1:26
6) double-tracked vocals from 2:27-2:32
7) Guitar from 2:58-3:00 and 3:10-3:12
8) starting at 3:35, the somewhat jarring cocktail party atmosphere with the scary siren thing that creeps back in after the initial fade out. I have a love hate deal with that part. I suppose it wouldn't be SFF without it. It contains that lethargic 'Cranberry Sauce'/'I buried Paul' voice.",1497052800,5

This is the Beatles as cool blues rock band. Nice guitar work from George. Paul plays his typically great bass lines. Electric piano (and handclaps) from John, rolling toms from Ringo.

This is a nice song to start out August, when the dogs days of summer are upon us. A lazy river song, floating along gently, barely a breeze to send us along. Nick Drake sings mysterious lyrics about a woman named Betty, the change of seasons, the weather, and of course, the river man. It has a pastoral Wind in the Willows aspect to it, as if we should expect to see Mole and Ratty passing by in a tiny rowboat.

It's a rockin from the get go tune. Lonnie Mack plays bass on it, that's pretty cool. The opening guitar is just what I'd expect to hear at a roadhouse. Bikers and chains.

109852,8354,18349,"Oh yeah, groove is in the heart...this is a fond fun funky look back at childhood by the beautiful Stevie Wonder. The verses of I Wish are memories of carefree times, harmless naughtiness, and rites of passage that kids experience. You look back on it all as an adult, having learned to follow the rules but laughing inside because, even though you got in trouble, those activities were often pretty fun at the time.

The music says don't even bother trying to remain still, you have no choice but to get down and boogie. Listen to Stevie, he is really enjoying himself. Listen to that walking bass line, the horns, the drums pounding away. Cool middle part at 1:30, do do do do....break it down.

The extremely funky outro lasts for the final minute plus. The horn riff repeats over and over, as Stevie makes little shouts here and there, and Nathan Watts careens all over the bass with little spasms of funky joy. The horns rise up a couple times, Stevie plays a great drum roll at 4:03. And I guess we have to fade it out so Stevie has room for his other Songs in the Key of Life.",1497052800,5

Written by singer and guitarist Alvin Lee, it expresses bewilderment at the crazy madness going on in the world but also frustration at not knowing how to fix it. The guitar solo that comes in at 2:09 is a classic.

109867,14288,20430,"The voices of Tony Bennett, Frank Sinatra and Eddy Arnold deteriorated after age 50, but I have early recordings of Ms. Vaughan and later recordings, plus I saw her live in concert about 1986 (when she was age 62), and her voice only grew more spectacular with age!  With the incomparable voice and range of Sarah Vaughan and an all-star band, the result of this album is less than the sum of its parts, largely due to less-than-optimal song selection (on this point, I agree with two of the critical reviewers).  The title track is a substandard, very repetitious song.  The following song, ""You're Blas"" is also inferior.  On the last song, concentrating on scat singing and the limitation of the accompaniment to percussion were eccentric choices.  The only song I really admire is ""Midnight Sun.""",1497052800,3

109869,8354,438,"If You Leave Me Now is a nostalgic trip to my childhood. It was released in 1976, when I was nine years old. I have vivid memories of hearing it during that summer, driving around in the VW Beetle with my Mom, hanging out at the public pool as it played over the loudspeakers. In a way, it is a kind of security blanket. In my mind's catalogue of songs, it shares a drawer with 'If you could read my mind.' Maybe I like soft songs with 'if' in the title? Nah...'If'' by Bread would never be allowed past security. Kick that one to the curb. That's the song that starts out with that 'wawawawawa...wawawawawa...'sound. 'If a man could throw up on a song, then why can't I throw up on it too...' hahaha.

But......I digress. IYLMN was a global smash for Chicago, hitting #1 in the US, UK, Australia, Canada, The Netherlands. I think it inspired every song in Air Supply's catalogue. It starts out all soft and gentle, light horns and strings, a finger cymbal. Peter Cetera busts out his high-pitched Beach Boy vocals. Nice harmonies, a soft Terry Kath acoustic guitar solo, joined by strings. The only part I don't like is around 2:00, those rising strings are totally over the top and unnecessary. And I can always do without James Pankow and his trombone, ughhh. I especially love the layered string buildup on the outro. And how about Cetera's 'Oooh, girl, just got to have you by my side' scat. OK, this is not the kind of music I typically listen to, but it's like being a Cubs fan...I can't not like this song, no matter how I try. Now, 'Hard to say I'm sorry?' OMG, Yuck.",1497052800,5
109870,8354,14539,"A simple three note progression runs through the verses on Mind Games, as John sings all kinds of trippy lyrics: 'some kind of druid dude lifting the veil', 'absolute elsewhere in the stones of your mind'. I always imagined 'mind gorillas', I didn't know what guerillas were when I was little. As wikipedia points out: ""Guerrilla"" and ""Guerrilla War"" redirect here; they are not to be confused with Gorilla. John also adds lots of positive messages: 'Love is the answer', 'chanting the mantra, peace on earth', 'love is a flower' etc.

My favorite part is the guitar riff at 2:54, after John finishes singing the 'yes is surrender' line. The song structure is very rigid, things kind of stay the same throughout, so that riff stands out when you hear it. Jim Keltner's drums are also great, they really punctuate certain lines, like 'putting their soul power to the karmic wheel' and right before 'millions of mind guerillas' at 3:10.",1497052800,5
109871,8354,3259,"One of my mellow faves. As close and light as I dare get to brushing up against something like Elton John's 'Your Song' or Rita Coolidge's 'We're All Alone'. If You Could Read My Mind includes a folky air of mystic dreaminess and presents a romantic honesty without flying off into Sapland. The music is pretty subdued, nice acoustic guitars and the use of one of my favorite techniques, the gently rising, unobtrusive string arrangement. Then there's Gord's voice, so soft and comfortable, like a perfectly worn baseball mitt. I also like that the lyrics don't always rhyme in the places where you think they should. It's a Dear Jane letter, the writer trying to explain why he is no longer in love, and having a hard time understanding it himself. Lots of cool images - a ghost from a wishing well, a fortress strong, a paperback novel from the drugstore, an old-time movie.

There are many different photos of Gordon Lightfoot out there...I prefer the rugged curly haired mustachioed mid 70s AM radio adult contemporary Gord's Gold version.",1497052800,5

109873,8354,20431,"River Man is in 5/4 time. I couldn't hear it at first. I kept thinking it was 10/8...it's basically a slower river than I was hearing.

This is a nice song to start out August, when the dogs days of summer are upon us. A lazy river song, floating along gently, barely a breeze to send us along. Nick Drake sings mysterious lyrics about a woman named Betty, the change of seasons, the weather, and of course, the river man. It has a pastoral Wind in the Willows aspect to it, as if we should expect to see Mole and Ratty passing by in a tiny rowboat. Featuring a nice string arrangement by Harry Robertson, this is taken from the Five Leaves Left album.",1497052800,5

Ronnie Wood on the guitar, showing why he was already in the Stones, he just didn't know it yet. Stay With Me also prominently features sweet keyboard work from the late great Ian McLagan.

The song is basically about the lifestyle of a rock star, the debauchery, the partying, taking a groupie to bed as long as she is prepared to be kicked out in the morning. My favorite line is I know your name is Rita 'Cause your perfume smelling sweeter. I always think, Hey Rod, how do you know that?

The Faces were like The Stones' wild little brothers or cousins. More mischievous and rambunctious, always looking to enjoy a pint or twenty.",1497139200,5

109883,8354,13169,"Can I have that record? No my brother, you've got to buy your own! The Chi-Lites...anyone remember that commercial for Hey Love? Classic.

Have You Seen Her is an early 70s R&B slow groove story of lost love. Dig that opening distorted guitar - bowwwww...bow wah bow wah bah ba ba baba...One month ago today, I was happy as a lark. The spoken word part lasts until 1:20 before the rest of the guys get to sing. They're like, yeah, you want some cheese with that whine? Man, she's gone and she's not coming back and you've been hanging out in a park with a bunch of kids for a whole month? What is wrong with you? The guy eventually admits that he's been used to havin someone to lean on, and now...well, I guess he has to make his own dinner and do his own laundry. At least he can go to the movies, or 'picture shows' if you will...by himself. Awww, he'll find someone else in another month...then he'll be singing 'I don't care if you've seen her, don't tell me if you've seen her.'

109884,8354,7365,"What do Mice Elf look like? This is a stone groove from Sly and the funky basstastic 'thumpin and pluckin' Larry Graham. Did you know that he is the uncle of rapper Drake? I did not know that. Some classic rhythm guitar from Freddie Stone. Horns and drums, also quite funky and cool. And it goes on and on...

The lyrics are sung by four band members simultaneously. They sound awesome on the chorus, and in little extraneous moments: 3:03, chen trench strokes, etc? at 3:08, 4:16.

I think this is the song that finally turned Sly Stone away from songs about racial harmony. He didn't think people were getting the message, plus stardom had gotten out of control. He turned further inward and away from the mainstream, took more drugs, and began to write more about more controversial subjects like racism and violence. He name checks his earlier tunes, as if to say 'what was that all about?' He felt like he had sold out and lost the good vibes.",1497139200,5

109889,8354,10824,"No Reply At All is a watershed moment for Genesis, marking the group's move from complex 70s Peter Gabriel-era prog rock to streamlined 80s Phil Collins-era pop. I love the frenetic energy: the joyful bursts from the Earth Wind and Fire horns; the drums with all its little percussion minions - woodblocks, claves, drum machine tools; the hyper keyboard rhythms; the funky bass. It is a grooving, smart, well-crafted piece of music. Phil Collins is good at this kind of thing...but people often forget that he is a fantastic drummer, too. He's keeps the rhythm snappy and on point.

My only complaint is Phil's voice on dahnce with me, you never dahnce with me. That's a fairly minor one. The whole abacab album is still a favorite of mine, lots of different sounds, textures, and pop hooks.",1497139200,5

And the cover, with all the moving pictures meanings: men moving the pictures, people weeping due to being emotionally moved by the pictures and, on the back, the realization that this is a movie, aka a moving picture. Pretty clever, eh?

Lady crying because they are taking away her favorite painting: Naked Man in Pentagram. Hey Lou, how much we gettin paid to carry around the painting of the woman on fire? I dunno, Crosby. Don't touch the painting, kid.

I would sit there studying the entire cover and sleeve as the record played...transfixed and mystified.

Tom Sawyer challenged my 13 year old brain, first because the name of the song was a children's book character I knew about, but the lyrics were esoteric and spoke of ""today's Tom Sawyer"", a different one, a warrior, with 'mean mean pride.'

Fantastic opening synthesizer and drums. The heavy crunch of guitar. The singer with the high-pitched shriek.

Catch the mystery...

Today's Tom Sawyer he gets high on you and the space he invades he gets by on you....
1:33 the trippy modulated synth of Geddy Lee.
2:00 the radical angular guitar solo of Alex Lifeson.
2:32 and 2:36 Neil Peart's amazing drum fills that are my favorite moments of the song.

He knows changes aren't permanent - but change is. (he put a twist on it there, you see).

Ch-keee, ch-keee, chk chk chk...that instrument is a guiro. It's being played by producer Jimmy Miller. Nicky Hopkins on heavy tolling bell piano. Merry Clayton accompanies Mick on the vocals and her presence adds that extra oomph to the theme of the song. I love that moment at 3:03, her voice rips the air as she screams out Rape, murder!, and Mick (I presume) lets out a woo! Keith's opening guitar riff is classic.

109909,8354,634,"I remember hearing More Than A Feeling on a Saturday morning in the Fall of 1976, in our station wagon as my Mom drove me to gymnastics class. I liked the song so much that it caused me to make my first and worst mail order record purchase. The TV had advertised a record called Muskrat Love, which had this song plus many other popular songs of the time, like Rubberband Man, Nadia's Theme, Theme from Airport '76, Car Wash, Boogie Fever, Sorry Seems to be the Hardest Word. Some real tepid stuff. Unfortunately, what I failed to understand about Muskrat Love from the commercial, was that these songs were not the original artist recordings. They were covers that sounded very close to the originals but not quite. I think my Mom tried to explain this to me before she helped me send $3.99 to some PO box in Michigan, but I probably didn't understand. After waiting 4-6 weeks for delivery, which is a lifetime to a nine year old, the album arrived and I eagerly placed it on the turntable. Right away, I knew something was amiss. More Than A Feeling sounded weird. I still listened to the album, but soon soured on it and eventually tossed it in the creek across from our house. I was disappointed, flabbergasted. How could someone be allowed to sell crap like this? Apparently, Canadians were spared this monstrosity.

I finally heard the actual Boston album years later, I heard the real More Than A Feeling. And Peace of Mind. And Foreplay/Long Time. As my brother would say, may your birthday be as cool as side one of Boston's first album. It is a great side. Side Two is good also, but I never cared for Something About You and Let Me Take You Home Tonight (Mama now it's all right). By the way, when did guys start referring to women as 'mama', and when did it end? Was it just a hippie thing?

Later on in life, I heard Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit, and noticed that the chord structure was very similar to More Than A Feeling, albeit an angrier angst-ridden 90s yin to Boston's happy 70s yang. The guitar solo in More Than A Feeling is like taking a dose of serotonin. It sends joy and pleasure right into your bloodstream.",1497139200,5

Cheap Sunglasses rocks, and it's hilariously ridiculous too. A humorous ode to eyewear. The first verse is about acquiring cheap sunglasses, the second verse is about stalking a woman who is wearing cheap sunglasses, and the third verse is also about acquiring cheap sunglasses. If there is a chorus, it's Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah.

Instrumentally, there is the prominent use of a Planet N keyboard, heard in the halting breaks at 0:37, 1:05 and 3:21, at the end of each verse/chorus. At 1:06 and 1:50, you get the keyboard and this funny woo-woo-woo alarm sound. Perhaps that's the police coming after the stalker, or a signal that if you currently are not wearing your sunglasses, now is the time to don them and keep your head down. There are some great guitar solos as well, starting at 1:26 and again at 2:10, displaying some excellent distortion and harmonics. Billy Gibbons rocks! Finally, at 3:23, they slow things down for a nice bluesy outro. In 1979, while disco was still prominent, ZZ Top were keeping rock n roll alive, baby.",1497139200,5
109912,8354,14960,"Welcome to Mordor. Slayer are here to provide the background music, and their message is basically, 'WHAT THE F ARE YOU DOING HERE?!!!' This is not easy listening la-z-boy nappy time music. It is loud and intense and it confronts our worst fears and behaviors. For fans, this music is a spiritual release, a bloodletting. For others, even if they might acknowledge the artistic statement, the presentation is unappealing. Sure, it's not for everyone. Even more rail against it because it scares them. They believe that singing about Sauron means you are Sauron.

Angel Of Death is rhythmically complex, filled with jackhammer double bass drumming and high speed guitar. From 1:39 - 3:35 we pass through a slower passage of precision playing. At 3:35 Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman unleash monster Orc solos to send you screaming into Mt Doom.

The song was inspired by the horrible acts of  Josef Mengele. Because of their interest in the subject, Slayer were accused of being Nazi sympathizers. As Hanneman said:

""I know why people misinterpret it  it's because they get this kneejerk reaction to it. When they read the lyrics, there's nothing I put in the lyrics that says necessarily he was a bad man, because to me  well, isn't that obvious? I shouldn't have to tell you that.""",1497139200,5

Notice in particular these moments: 0:17, 0:26, 0:42-0:45, that little squeak at 1:10, and on and on...it's like finding musical pokemons. You just have to listen.

Very much of its time, breezy mid-70s production with a heavy layer of smoothness, kind of like 10CC's 'I'm Not in Love' or The Hollies 'Air that I Breathe'.

Nicky Hopkins on keyboards and John's pal Klaus Voormann on bass. I always feel a little sadness about John when I hear his music, but then I know he doesn't want people hanging their heads - keep yer chin up, world! I never knew that John had used the string arrangement already, on Nilsson's version of Many Rivers to Cross. It's fun to hear it on a different song. Once in a rare while I obsess over the tinniness of the reverb used on John's voice, but it's pretty well buried under the heavy string gravy...man it's thick. But so ultra-creamy.

It has been covered by such artists as Aretha Franklin and Elvis Presley. Simon began working on it in the same house George Harrison sang about on the Beatles' Blue Jay Way.

It is a song of comfort and solidarity, it has a light in the darkness quality, no matter how low you feel I'm on your side. The piano gives it the feel of some sort of old hymn that has been around forever. Towards the end, the duo sing in harmony on the Sail on silver girl part, and the drums gain strength on see how they shine.  Angelic strings carry it away to the horizon.

Classic guitar riff, anyone who plays rock guitar has probably practiced it at some point in their lives. And of course there is the COWBELL! That SNL sketch was so brilliant, Christopher Walken 'THE Bruce Dickinson.' Yeah, the cowbell is fairly non-stop but it's low in the mix and often falls into a sonic blind spot so it tunes in and out of my consciousness. I think I almost typed couscousness there, ha ha that's what I was thinking...weird.

The guitar solo is pretty classic as well. Sometimes I wish they hadn't let the last note sustain so far into the verse, but not a deal breaker, Blue yster Cult. What a great name for a band. When I was younger, I thought they were scary, based on the cover of the 45 I had of Burnin for You. Ha ha, these guys are goofy. Where does one find blue oysters anyhow? Or is it a blue cult that worships oysters? Or does an umlaut over the 'o' mean something entirely different? Talk amongst yourselves.",1497225600,5

109972,8354,16981,"A Day in the Life flows right out of Sgt Pepper's (Reprise) so you get a few seconds of the audience fade out as the gently strummed guitar enters. Majestic piano chords appear moments later. Then John Lennon's dreamy vocals come in on the first verse: I read the news today, oh boy, accompanied by light piano, maracas, and bass.

He blew his mind out in a car is a continuation of the first news story, and right after this line at 0:48 Ringo comes in with a dramatic drum fill, and he continues to fill in the spaces through the end of the verse.

After I'd love to turn you on at the end of the verse about seeing a film, the orchestra appears for the mind-blowing ascent into the clouds. Then we get Paul's nifty little woke up fell out of bed section. Jazzy piano lines.

One final verse about 4,000 holes in Blackburn, Lancashire, and then another epic orchestral maneuver, and we get to the final giant piano chord fadeout. The weird inner groove part is attached to the end of the song, which I wish wasn't there because it sometimes freaks me out to no end. There I am, all relaxed as the giant chord dissipates, then I get the shock of whatever it is...""I never could be any other way"" or something. Ughh, be quiet! Leave me alone!

I am often amazed by this song, like I almost can't believe anyone could create such a transcendent piece of music. It sits there at the end of the Sgt Pepper album in its own space, separate from the previous songs.. It is the room at the top, that you need a special code to enter.

109990,8354,19758,"A beautifully delicate song that was based on a Keith Richards riff he called 'Japanese Thing', Moonlight Mile is about the exhaustion of being on the road for too long, and wanting to be home. Mick Jagger plays the acoustic guitar. Mick Taylor on lead. It is mostly a two Micks composition (Jagger and Taylor). Keith wasn't around when the Micks were working on it, so Mick J wasn't so self-conscious and poured out these improvised lyrics. They conjure amazing visions:

The sound of strangers sending nothing to my mind
I'm sleeping under strange strange skies
Made a rag pile of my shiny clothes
I got silence on my radio

It is full of majestic strings, and you can definitely feel a Japanese theme running through it, like a Samurai traveling home after battle. Charlie Watts is amazing, the drums and cymbals are incredible. The beginning is the longing to be home, and the end is finally arriving. The final chord reminds me of the end of Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony.

110000,8354,6274,"Imagine Black Dog without those opening five seconds, or the whole Led Zeppelin IV album for that matter. Jimmy Page called it ""waking up the army of guitars."" It also prevents Robert Plant from sneaking up on us - we are ready when his voice bursts out of the speakers. The song is about a lustful old black Labrador Retriever that lived near Headley Grange during the recording sessions.

The precision of the music is indeed reminiscent of a military close-order drill. The main riff, written by John Paul Jones, represents the guitar army, layers of them, marching together, inspiring awe and respect. They even create a brass timbre somehow, at least to my ears. The call and response pattern lasts until 0:42, when the riff gets twisted up and discombobulated before righting itself at 0:52 as we head into the oh yeah break. Jimmy plays some nifty descending runs and we head into the second verse: I gotta roll can't stand still got a flamin heart can't get my fill.

At 1:27 we get a calming set of ah ah ah etc from Robert, but then at 1:38 John Bonham's drums explode with awesome power. This is a tremendously exciting moment, one of my favorites of any song. The levels are perfect: attack, loudness, reverb, emotional effect. Whoa. It takes us into another new part, the hey baby whoa baby I-don't-wear-pants-and-I'm-a-lecherous-black-dog part. This goes on until 2:04.

The song cycles back through the basic layout once more, adding a sweet guitar double helix at 3:07. Finally, at 3:37, the general of the guitar army proudly shows off the skills of improvised battle strategy, as the troops continue their parade with no signs of tiring.",1497225600,5
110001,8354,1903,"There are exhilarating rock intros out there, like The Faces' Stay With Me, Iggy Pop's Lust For Life, and Bruce Springsteen's Born to Run. But I think Rush's The Spirit of Radio is the best of the bunch. The guitar riff is like my dog suddenly jumping on me in the morning, wake up and play and be happy! A big slobbery kiss at 0:04, I try to roll over but she just jumps over to that side as well, bounding all about. Finally at 0:17 I have surrendered to her will and I am up. Look out the window, turn on the coffee, eat some breakfast, get dressed, grab the leash and treats and baggies, and then at 0:42 we hit the open road for a walk.

Begin the day with a friendly voice, a companion unobtrusive...well, I can't continue with the dog analogy because at 5 in the morning her voice is loud and obnoxious, and when we are out walking in the neighborhood she can occasionally be quite obtrusive. However, she is a very friendly companion.

The Spirit of Radio is about...drum roll...radio! The joy and beauty of music coming through the speakers, dancing around you on the airwaves, undemanding contact in your happy solitude. At 1:24, bass drum pounds and the first guitar riff returns, and another lyrical section about...the radio! Isn't it amazing! A gift beyond price. We can't see the airwaves, but we pick up on the sounds entering our ears, our bright antennae bristle with the energy, and the translation through our minds produces emotional feedback.

Of course, although one likes to believe in the freedom of music, radio is a business, and there are glittering prizes and endless compromises going on behind the scenes that shatter the illusion of integrity, yeah.

Check out that tumbling down moment at 3:36, it's the exasperation of dealing with the radio executive, the schmoozing DJ, the Biz. But Rush pick themselves up for an introspective moment: For the words of the profits were written on the studio wall. They record the music and radio helps sell their albums, and the band members makes their livings this way, so buck up and deal with it. Did they think adding a reggae groove would help? Well, it didn't. This whole discussion of radio has made them bitter and reflective, so they decide to release their emotions with a sizzling guitar solo that extends out into their listeners' brains and by the end everyone is happy. And now, a thousand words from our sponsors, followed by a 90 minute classic rock music marathon, and we will only play songs you've already heard a zillion times because if you hear anything unfamiliar it might be considered obtrusive and we'd get in trouble with the FCC.",1497225600,5

The opening Tear the roof off the sucker words are spoken by Ray Davis. The primary lyrics are grouped in three clusters, with multiple voices, crazy asides, harmonies and shouts. Musically, it all comes around to the main bass riff, also doubled by guitar. It's from Mothership Connection, one of the most influential funk albums ever released.",1497225600,5

110005,8354,11611,"Slave is my favorite song from Tattoo You, an album filled with songs inspired by the character from Fantasy Island. Mick has that laid back Miss You quality to his vocals, dig that spoken word section about stealing something off the shelves, pass by the liquor store and be back by quarter to twelve. Amazing. Then at 1:56 he does that duh I'm Mick Jagger yeah baby yeah baby. Hilariously goofus. Boss! Boss! What is Meek Jahgairz fantasy? Well, Tattoo, he is tired of being a slave to the entertainment world and making lots of money. He wants to experience how his life would have turned out if he'd decided to become a physical education teacher like his father.

The music is a sweet funky groove that rolls along all slow and relaxed. The music is totally Tattoo You-ish, I swear the album sounds radically different from all their others, although there is definitely some Emotional Rescue in it (She's So Cold), and Some Girls (Lies). The drums are so cracking loud and out in front and everything is kind of in your face. The album is made up of songs they had recorded already, so maybe the additional overdubs gave it this sound. I haven't read up on it.

Slave features the excellent Billy Preston on keyboards and the mighty saxophone of Sonny Rollins, a spectacular treat. There are so many fantastic ensemble moments, it's hard to pick one. But if I had to choose, I would say Sonny's sax screech at 4:05 is the peak moment. That's the whoa! moment. The moment when Tattoo yells, ze plane! ze plane! Unlike Mick, Tattoo loved being a slave...to Mr. Rourke.",1497225600,5

110012,8354,8637,"Has an intro ever sounded so autumnally heavy as the opening 0:30 on Ten Years Gone? It has that 'getting darker earlier' feel to it - leaves blanket the ground, the sunlight slants create strange hues, and there's a chill in the air.

Robert Plant tells of a woman he was in love with ten years ago (so 1965-ish?), a few years before Led Zeppelin formed. She gave him an ultimatum: her or the music. Jimmy Page patched the musical ideas together. The song goes through a number of variations. After the first 0:30, a second part comes in with a descending chord sequence, like A-G-D-Dm. The intro sequence then comes back in at 1:01 and Robert waxes nostalgic starting at 1:16:

Then as it was, then again it will be
And though the course may change sometimes
Rivers always reach the sea

John Bonham thunders in at 1:34...building on to the repeated second part of the intro, and we continue along into the next verse.

At 2:30 we head into the middle section. Jimmy's guitar rises up out of the mist and it's like the sun has come out and everything sparkles and shines. Robert gains strength from this and expresses his bitter feelings of regret:

Did you ever really need somebody
And really need 'em bad

At 3:47 Jimmy leads us across a field and we head back in among the trees at 4:10. Now, though, the sun filters down through the branches and Robert remarks that even though much time has passed

We are eagles of one nest
The nest is in our soul

There will always be a special bond that they shared. At 5:03, Robert turns reflective again; the face of his lost love still appears in his dreams. He cries out at the end that the memories are still there. He still cherishes them, holdin' on, ten years gone. The music surrounds and comforts him like protective spirits.",1497312000,5

110020,8354,8851,"I remember hearing Fool in the Rain on the radio in 1980 and calling the radio station to find out what it was. I wasn't too familiar with Led Zeppelin yet, so I was later surprised at how poppy this song was compared to stuff like Whole Lotta Love. The middle samba section is fun, but the best part of the song is the awesome drum fill that comes out of it at 3:44. I get fixated on it sometimes and have to rewind and listen to it multiple times. Jimmy's guitar solo after the break is also one I like a lot. It's a bit sloppy, but so is standing in the rain.

Fool in the Rain is Robert Plant channeling his inner Elvis Presley and Bill Murray's Nick the Lounge Singer. He sings like he's suavely strolling on a Vegas stage with a glass in his hand...Well there's a light in your eye that keeps shinin' (thayouverymuch), like an ol star that can't wait for the night (you know what I'm talkin about), somebody get me a scotch and tonic, it's gonna be a long night, hrumph.

And I stand in the rain on the corner (with no umbrella mind you) just watchin people go shuffling on down-town-uh. Look at those crazy ol people, they gonna turn it aroun, roun roun. (hey where's Charlie Hodge with my scarf, I'm sweatin like a pig here, ladies and gentlemen). I'm a fool in the rain, I'm just a fool in the rain. I'm all wet and I'm cold and don't you know that I'm a fool in the rain, (scats: 'see I was on the wrong corner all along and so all this worryin was really unnecessary'). Hit it, Ron. (big drum roll and ensemble flourish) Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, thank you.

110044,8354,2655,"Elegantly produced by Alan Parsons, Al Stewart's Year of the Cat is a classic of smooth 70s light rock. It's like going to bed on a warm summer night as a breeze blows lightly through the curtains. Like snuggling on a soft giant papasan chair in 1976 and having this on eight-track. Like buttah. No rough spots whatsoever; even the heavier guitar solo is balanced by strings to maintain the equilibrium.

If it were some sappy 70s love song I wouldn't like it. It's romantic, yes, but also esoteric and cool, like a Bogart movie. A tourist arrives in a town and meets a mysterious woman. He spends the night with her and in the morning realizes that he has been left behind by his tour group so he is stuck there. No big deal to him, he's carefree and open. Any way the wind blows....

It has some of my favorite lyrics of any song, especially:

She comes out of the sun in a silk dress running
Like a watercolor in the rain

Gives me goosebumps sometimes when I hear that.

Also, you go strolling through the crowd like Peter Lorre contemplating a crime. I had no idea who Peter Lorre was for a long time, but I knew his voice from cartoons. Eventually I saw him in Casablanca. He was also incredible in M.

She comes in incense and patchouli. Nowadays, whenever I hear the word patchouli I imagine John Cusack telling Tim Robbins to get his 'patchouli stink outta my store' in High Fidelity. Great film for music geeks.

The middle instrumental passage is great as well. It flows...strings at 3:10 into light electric guitar at 3:24 into heavier electric guitar at 3:54 into Phil Kenzie's superb saxophone at 4:14...then into the final verse.

FYI: the cat is the fourth animal symbol in the 12-year cycle of the Vietnamese zodiac, replacing the rabbit in the Chinese zodiac. So, if you were born in 1963, 1975, 1987, or 1999, you might be a cat.",1497312000,5
110045,3156,1266,"This has to be one of the best albums that the Houston rapper Paul Wall has ever released. That being said, the album's subject matter can be quite repetitive with most of the album being drugs and money, but its his pop-rap vocals and pop infused hip/hop beats that will keep you entertained, and isn't that what an artist who been out for over a decade should aim to do. The album is filled with drug and money references and plenty of male ego (without the misogynistic of most rappers). I especially love the song ""Invisible Set Baguette"" a song bout his grillz, especially with lines like ""every time I smile my grandma catch the Holy Ghost"" and ""diamonds in my mouth dancing like Debbie Allen"". With sounds like that it's had to take this rapper too serious, but one you can listening to on your commute and enjoy the lyrics and beats.",1497312000,5

The song was a foretaste of the musical career that would make David Bowie a musician with his own cult following. It is a finely crafted piece of music where the tune itself is great and not because a particular musician was great. Think of how the Beatles were great because of their creativity rather than their abilities on their particular instruments.

110206,16684,1448,"This is a decent mp3 set of various works by Tchaikovsky, heavy on works for orchestra. The best parts here are the less frequently heard works, such as the Orchestral Suites 2 & 4, the Piano Trio in A minor, The Seasons, the Danish Festival Overture and others. The version of the Manfred Symphony is really good, and it has been for a long time one of my favorite lesser known Tchaikovsky works. However, on the down side, the more familiar pieces in this set just do not seem to be very good performances. The numbered symphonies all sound bland and lifeless.(BTW-where is the Symphony No. 3, the Polish? You can't put in every symphony, including the Manfred, and leave out one of the earlier ones.) The piano and violin concertos also sound barely decent. The ballets are a strange mixture. You get the complete Nutcracker, (though split up over several tracks in a very frustrating way) seven or eight pieces from Swan Lake, and a single excerpt from Sleeping Beauty. What's up with that? The suite from each one would have sufficed, if that's how they were going to do it. The chamber pieces were decent, though it would have been nice to see the sextet version of Souvenier de Florence instead of the string orchestra version. And the piano pieces were barely noticed.
  Overall, if you are a newbie to Tchaikovsky and aren't too picky on the quality of the performances, you might want to try this out. At 99 cents it's not terrible. But if not, then just cherry pick this set for the Manfred and the Orchestral Suites. Plus the Piano Trio. -------------PEACE",1497571200,3

110340,5777,19756,"Inspired by the Tibetan ""Book Of The Dead"" this is one of John Lennon's best songs during his time with The Beatles. It was the last track on the ""Revolver"" album and would be seen by many as s message the Beatles were sending to their fans. Supposedly this was John's way of telling the world that the Beatles were experimenting with LSD. Whether that may be true or not is open to debate. The song itself is I think one of the best song the Beatles ever done. Recorded in the point of their career when the Beatles had stopped touring and instead would go into the recording studio to experiment and expand on their musical talents. This was during that time the Beatles were transitioning their lives and music. ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" is far cry from singing about wanting to Hold Your Hand or ""yeah, yeah, yeah"". This is a song with a swirling hodge podge of guitar riffs and sound effects with a heavy drum beat driving it. Certainly different from anything the Fab Fours fans had ever encountered. But if you are a fan of The Beatles this is a song to consider adding to your MP3 player along with many of their earlier hits.",1497830400,5
110341,10690,648,"Nothing like listening to the ""Original"" release of this song! Brings back great memories of when songs made sense and not the current crappy nonsensical so-called music of today.",1497830400,5

110351,247,20400,"Note: This record contains political statements and sentiments that you might not agree with. If this bothers you do not purchase this album.
Roger Waters first solo album in twenty five years is better than it has any right to be. The production is really strong, all the performances are good, and it's nice to see that Waters hasn't mellowed any in the past two decades (if anything he is more misanthropic and angry). Not all of the songs here take hold quite as they should but everything does work as a piece. And if this isn't his best work that isn't a terribly surprising thing considering this man is behind some of the greatest rock and roll records of all time. If you enjoy Waters' music you will enjoy ""Is This The Life We Really Want?""",1497830400,4

110396,12470,7513,"I'm not certain of the date range of these recordings, but I would guess sometime in the 1960's.  Vox recordings from that era were typically a bit tinny, probably because they thought nothing of putting 30 minutes of music on one side of an LP.  Most of these recordings are better than that, but some are lacking.  The performances are a bit more schmaltzy and slower in tempo than the more recent recordings of Rachmaninoff I've heard.  The Symphonic Dances are my favorite among these recordings.  Pretty good, but there are other recordings of S R's work that I prefer.  A good value for the price which is what Vox tends to sell.",1497916800,4

I see many negative reviews that come from what else? The lunatic fringe of the repiglican party!

It takes a brave person to come out and tell it like it is, knowing full well, the sheeple will try to shame you and criticize you, as that is what they do when you point out how screwed up their policies and thinking is.

Roger has facts, not fox news fiction! The music is very Pink Floyd influenced and the artists are top notch. I did not even know this CD was out and would love to see it on the top 100 Billboard chart, whether Roger would want that or not.

A singer - songwriter who has an Academy Aware, Presidential Medal of Freedom, and Nobel Peace prize, that made his roots grow in the tumultuous 60's ... probably has something you might relate to.

Don't play what is on the recording; rather, where the bridge begins ( around 3:30 ) have your bassist play a climbing / falling run continually for the 4 verses. He/she will know what I'm talking about. 1 - 4 - 7 from the F to the low C and up to the G where the notes do a scoop from low back up to the F. It rocks.

110512,8354,3872,"I was thinking about the scene in the Oliver Stone film where Robby Krieger plays Light My Fire on  guitar for the rest of the group. Krieger wrote most of the song, including the first verse and chorus. Jim Morrison wrote the verse that contained wallow in the mire and love become a funeral pyre. This is according to The Doors FAQ book.

The song opens with the crack of a drum followed by some baroque-esque keyboard from Ray Manzarek. The lyrics are bookends for the vast instrumental middle section that begins at 1:07 and lasts until 5:42 (about 65% of the song).

I like the little chord twist that happens after the second Come on baby light my fire, at 0:32. A relative of the piano chord change in Imagine. As far as the instrumental section goes, I enjoy the keyboard stuff but I am really into Robby's guitar. It comes in at 3:18 and has all kinds of cascading lines up and down the neck and interesting modal sequences. John Densmore's drums have some great moments of their own, little fills here and there, keeping it all grooving along.

It's a classic song, covered by many artists including Jose Feliciano, Shirley Bassey and Stevie Wonder.",1498176000,5

110526,8354,10878,"Robert Plant is rock's ultimate mystic nature boy. I mean, his last name is Plant, right? It's like he came up through the earth to blossom in the sun and soak up life among forests and streams, stones and gardens.

The Rain Song is this concept in full bloom; it's a lovely ballad. Jimmy Page plays the guitar like a gentle spring rain, moist green leaves quivering with raindrops. Robert strolls among the trees, communing with nature, experiencing the joy and mystery of the world...It is the springtime of my loving, the second season I am to know. He is on the verge of Donovan territory, epistle to dippy and all that. But Robert's sensitivity is more profound than that fey lad's. More like Nick Drake, attuned to his surroundings and daily life. Robert also sees himself as a strong heroic figure, as evidenced by his fantasy sequence in the film The Song Remains the Same, where he searches for the Grail and rescues a damsel being held in a castle.

The lyrics compare the emotional journey of love to the changes of the seasons, rising and falling, summer to winter, a cycle. There are occasional rough patches, but as long as the torch burns those can be overcome. This is the wonder of devotion. Life and love are filled with joyful moments, but true to nature, upon us all a little rain must fall. Hopefully it helps strengthen the bond, not becoming a deluge that wipes it all out. I never understood the line this is the mystery of the quotient. Something involving division, right? At one point Robert studied to be an accountant, so maybe this line is a flashback to a math problem he was trying to solve? haha.

The music is delicate and romantic. Mellotron and piano, light guitar, no Zeppelin bombast until late in the song, around 5:00, and even then it's not extreme.",1498176000,5

The music is fantastic, some cool bass lines and guitar solos and Billy Preston on the organ, and John gets in some nice wails, but let's be honest here -  I Want You (She's So Heavy) is primarily about the final movement. If you want to skip straight to that, it begins at 4:39. It is a massive wall of sound, heavy and intense. Layers of guitar build up like an iron snowball, massive and powerful, crushing everything in its way. The winds howl all around, and it feels like the world is about to end. In case you're curious, the finale is almost through its fifteenth cycle when the song abruptly hits the wall. I'm still never quite ready for it.",1498176000,5

110537,8354,8476,"Riders On the Storm reminds me of many things:

1) an episode from The Wonder Years when Kevin and Paul are hanging out in the woods with a 'bad' kid.

2) riding in the church van to Moody Bible Institute in Chicago on a stormy night in 1979 and hearing this song on the radio, along with Bad Co's Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy and Robert Palmer's Bad Case of Loving You...why do I remember these details? beats me.

3) Old Mother Hubbard...like a dog without a bone.

4) The song Ghost Riders in the Sky...Jim Morrison's whispered vocals are the ghosts.

5) The Bugs Bunny cartoon called Hare Way to the Stars, the part from 4:00-4:15 when Bugs makes the green bird martian mimic him is like the end of Riders On the Storm from about 4:35-4:45, the keyboard and guitar having a similar exchange.

Best line: His brain is squirmin' like a toad...creepy and gross.

It is a great night song, very dark and lonely, lots of stormy special effects - rain and thunder. Have an umbrella ready. After 2:44 it's pretty much just music, keyboards and guitar stepping in puddles and splashing about.",1498176000,5

110539,8354,4885,"When I was young, Nights in White Satin gave me more late night heebie-jeebies than any other song, with the possible exception of Gary Wright's 'Dream Weaver'. My Zenith clock radio with its glowing numbers would be the only light in my bedroom, and I would imagine all sorts of ghosts lurking in the corners or hanging around outside among the trees. A truly haunting, lonely piece of music.

It starts off quietly, with a flute and some strings and light glockenspiel or something. Then the gently strummed acoustic guitar and drums come in, followed by Justin Hayward's mournful vocals. An eerie mellotron enters the mix at 0:42. I love the mellotron, but wow, what a creepy sound. At 1:06 we get our first dose of the crying angel voices, time to grab my pillow and stick my head under the covers. Imagine Scrooge hearing those at the stroke of midnight. Yikes!

Another pass through verse and chorus and crying angels, then at 2:18 a big smack of the drum and we head into a gloomy flute solo, accompanied by acoustic guitar and more sad mellotron.

The night passes on, the moon drifts in the sky, the stars twinkle, clouds pass by, but the narrator does not sleep. He is suffering through the night, having many 'what does it all mean' thoughts: just what the truth is, I can't say anymore. The orchestra cranks it up at 3:50, the crying angels continue to torment us. At 4:35 the orchestra surrounds us with a wall of strings and horns as the narrator rolls around in bed, unable to shake free of doom and madness. At 4:57 we are allowed a brief moment of peace before it all shatters at 5:20 in piercing strings and alarmed horns. It is all too much, and the narrator soon loses consciousness.

At 5:38 he enters a dream state. There is a brief instant of silence, then the voice of Mike Pinder startles us at 5:54 with the spoken 'Late Lament': Breathe deep, the gathering gloom, watch lights fade from every room...this part would freak me out to no end. I love to imitate the British accent: cold hearted orb that rules the night. After this section, the strings and horns ascend to rage against the impending dawn, making one final stab at 7:00. The final gong at 7:07 signifies the appearance of the sun, and the long scary night is thankfully over.",1498176000,5

110541,8354,6232,"Consider the opening 0:51 of War Pigs. It explodes like a bomb hitting the ground in one of those WWII aerial films - simultaneous heavy guitar, bass and cymbal crash. While the chord sustains, a few more bombs are seen falling beneath us, through a grey sky towards a black and white city below. Listen to the guitar at 0:07, this kind of hammered-on note an octave above the root. It is like the sudden moment of impact, with the waves of destruction rippling outward. Away to the west, tanks crawl slowly across farm fields, prepared to blow away anything in their way. At 0:31 a warning siren in a nearby town calls for everyone to evacuate.

At 0:52 the pace quickens with sharp stabbing chords and pulse-quickening hi-hat. Ozzy Osbourne begins to sing at 1:03:

Generals gathered in their masses
Just like witches at black masses (or my preference, 'smell each other's stinky asses')

I like the double meaning of 'mass'. Similar to 'please please me' by The Beatles. The rest of Geezer Butler's lyrics are good, and it's a great anti-war song but, you know what? I've never liked Ozzy's voice all that much. That's all I'm going to say about it.

Tony Iommi plays fantastic guitar throughout: those triplets at 1:29, the trill at 1:34, the descending chords at 1:48, the little bend at 1:50, the chug and slash part from 2:08-2:17 and the riffs that accompany Politicians hide themselves away. Beginning at 3:30 he plays several solos that overlap until around 4:20. I love those pitch bends from 4:13-4:18. A very clever guitarist.

Bill Ward plays excellent drum fills everywhere, particularly at 1:38, 1:52, 1:57, 2:02 and on and on, through Iommi's solo, and 5:28-5:30. Geezer Butler holds it all down with his mighty bass playing.

The final 2:12 is a section called 'Luke's Wall'. It's a pretty cool way to end the song. Some great drums in this part, too. And bonus for me: no Ozzy.",1498176000,5

110546,8354,4577,"I think I first heard this song on the radio late one night, many years after I had first become aware of Rush through their Moving Pictures album. I had even heard 2112, so I still wonder why it took me so long to hear Working Man. Perhaps because the internet wasn't around yet?

Working Man is a brick fortress of 70s power trio rock. The opening guitar riff is like poured concrete, reinforced by industrial strength bass and drums. Similar to Light My Fire in that it follows the vocals-long instrumental-vocals pattern. Geddy Lee sings about the day to day pattern of a guy doing the typical 9-5 job. At 2:05, Geddy plays a descending bass line and the tempo kicks up into Alex Lifeson's guitar solo that lasts just long enough to enjoy a nice cold beer.

When a Cleveland radio station began playing it, many listeners thought it was a new Led Zeppelin song. Rush's first album is definitely in that vein, since Neil Peart hadn't yet joined to apply his PhD in Science Fiction lyrics. John Rutsey was their drummer. Man, I feel like Homer Simpson talking about Grand Funk Railroad and Mountain in the Homerpalooza episode. Stupid Millhouse asking to change the station.

110589,8354,2597,"Kashmir is an undisputed classic. The band members themselves have acknowledged that this song best expressed their vision.

It opens with a crash of cymbal with a waltzing 3/4 string/guitar progression accompanied by a 4/4 drum pattern. It's what makes the song so interesting, this confluence of different time streams. Keeps things slightly tipsy. Personally, I cannot hear the opening of Kashmir without also being aware of the ending of Trampled Underfoot, the song that precedes it on the album. It is a fleeting moment, but it's there in my brain.

My favorite part of the song is the minimalist section that lasts from 2:18-3:14; there is so much breathing room in it, Bonham's drums combined with the bass and the descending string slides. Very seductive.

Kashmir has a circular theme that rotates around its axis with precision, sections linking up with each other like clockwork. Nice flanging and phasing here and there, mostly on the drum flurries; e.g., 7:50.

Most fans probably know the scene in Fast Times at Ridgemont High when Ratner is instructed by Damone to play side one of Led Zeppelin IV, but he 'messes up' by playing Physical Graffiti instead. We all know that any Zeppelin album would make a good choice. Well, maybe not side two of In Through the Out Door.

110606,8354,2597,"Kashmir is an undisputed classic. The band members themselves have acknowledged that this song best expressed their vision.

It opens with a crash of cymbal with a waltzing 3/4 string/guitar progression accompanied by a 4/4 drum pattern. It's what makes the song so interesting, this confluence of different time streams. Keeps things slightly tipsy. Personally, I cannot hear the opening of Kashmir without also being aware of the ending of Trampled Underfoot, the song that precedes it on the album. It is a fleeting moment, but it's there in my brain.

My favorite part of the song is the minimalist section that lasts from 2:18-3:14; there is so much breathing room in it, Bonham's drums combined with the bass and the descending string slides. Very seductive.

Kashmir has a circular theme that rotates around its axis with precision, sections linking up with each other like clockwork. Nice flanging and phasing here and there, mostly on the drum flurries; e.g., 7:50.

Most fans probably know the scene in Fast Times at Ridgemont High when Ratner is instructed by Damone to play side one of Led Zeppelin IV, but he 'messes up' by playing Physical Graffiti instead. We all know that any Zeppelin album would make a good choice. Well, maybe not side two of In Through the Out Door. So much has been written about this song, you can find many online treatises that analyze its brilliance. I prefer to let it all wash over me like an oasis in the desert.",1498262400,5

110611,18245,3006,"It's true. I can't think of another album that has a huge impact on rap/hip hop and the topped charts since then. It's been 14 years and way so many people still bob their heads and know the words to ""what up gangsta"" (which wasn't even a single!), ""in da club,"" ""wanksta,"" ""21 questions,"" ""many men,"" ""patiently waiting,"" etc. THIS is what makes a classic. Everything has to fall into place. It's not just, ""is every song good?"" It's more than that. It's the right artist at the right time with the right circumstances and attitude. 10 years down the line will people hear the songs And sing all the words?. People have been throwing around the term ""classic"" nowadays practically right when the album comes out. Nah man. Kendrick hasn't dropped a classic. Wayne never dropped one either. Nobody has put out anything like 50 Cent's Get Rich or Die Trying. His story was crazy, his time dropping mix tapes as if they were albums was crazy. He was jacking beats like it was nothing and making dope songs. His confidence and sense of humor got people. Then, Eminem and Dre signed him and got right to work making this. Everything was just perfect looking back on it. Say what you want about him now lol but 50 dropped a certified banger and a classic that we'll always remember him by.",1498348800,5

110614,8354,10654,"Tea For One is a large moon that orbits Presence, the Pluto of the Led Zeppelin solar system. Out there in space, barely visible, a dark piece of rock that is seldom visited. Well, I can't say I blame them. I wouldn't care to dine at the yacht club with the 70s family and their creepy object either.

This song deserves way more appreciation than it gets. People treat it like a bastard child of Since I've Been Loving You, from the third album. Although I like SIBLY, I occasionally tire of Robert's screechy hyper vocals. Tea For One is way more relaxed, just guitar bass and drums, no organ and no screech.

The opening groove is fantastic, this 3/4 guitar riff against 4/4 drums...then it is suddenly over just as we're starting to roll with it. It's like the band wanted to rock out, but then heavy and oppressive clouds rolled in. The remaining 9:00 is a slowwwww minor blues meditation on loneliness and boredom, the saddest song they ever did. Robert sings about time dragging on, wanting to be home instead of sitting there drinking tea by himself. His voice sounds haggard and lost, like 'lord, please get me the f home.' When he sings One minute seems like a lifetime, it's hard not to feel for him. It is the blues on a completely personal level. The music sticks with him in solidarity, those slow riffs muscling along like some poor wounded creature at the end of hope. I also love the reverb gloss on everything, it creates a very intimate setting. Some critics claim the musicians sound bored, but I think there's a lot more to it; regret, resignation, sacrifice, choices, things they gave up on the road to superstardom.",1498348800,5
110615,8354,7132,"The opening guitar scrapes out a space between the ears, making room for another guitar, then a bass and drums. Neil Young sings Be on my side I'll be on your side, baby. Kind of like the power struggle over the bed between me, wife, and dog when we are going to sleep at night.

Neil Young & Crazy Horse perform Down by the River with a loosely structured rural grace. Neil sings with a hushed confessional tone, describing how he shot her dead. The ol murder ballad. 'He had to do it, she was shooting her mouth off about his mom.' Oops, that's Crispin Glover in River's Edge. Both are about a river and a murder. Perhaps Neil was a young Feck. If you haven't seen River's Edge, I sorry for you.

When Neil isn't singing, he's choking out all sorts of primal electric sounds on his guitar. Love those one note solos! 1:52...then at

3:22 he lays down this amazing lick. Guitars trade some great stabbing chords for a bit, then an even crazier one/two note solo starts up at 3:56. Neil at his electric best: cutting loose in his idiosyncratic way, no rules, working out all the subtle nuances of one note until he feels it's ok to move on to a different one. Then having little spasms of fast-picked chaos.

I just love Neil's vocal delivery. Nobody sounds like him, letting the words out of his mouth with this kind of delicate seesaw between innocence and wisdom.",1498348800,5

110639,8354,2486,"Peter Frampton, Englishman, gave a gift to young America to help them celebrate and enjoy the red white and blue bicentennial summer. Frampton Comes Alive! was a massive commercial success, staying at the top of the charts for 10 weeks. It was THE album of 1976.

Do You Feel Like We Do is the final and longest track on the double live album. There is a momentary pause, the crowd waiting, then Frampton starts playing the classic opening riff. The rest of the band come in, bass, keyboards and drums.

To the audience, Frampton and his mates can do no wrong. It's like the crowd already know and love the album, even though it didn't exist yet. Maybe there were flashing CHEER and APPLAUSE signs? Perhaps they all owned and loved his studio album, Frampton's Camel? Nah, face it, Frampton was ON and he had them in the palm of his hand. It's great fun 70s rock, it sounds excellent, how could anyone not be having a blast at this show? Of course they feel like you do, Peter. You're the Pied Piper, Peter Piper.

After the first couple of verses, Frampton plays a tasty little lick at 2:10, then kicks out a fantastic solo from 2:21-3:01. Following another verse and chorus, at 3:52 the music slides into a quiet middle section, featuring

Bob Mayo...on the keyboards, Bob Mayo, who plays a groovy solo from 4:12-5:17. Frampton starts asking the crowd, Do You Feel Like We Do...and, yes, I think they do. He solos again from 5:55-7:00.

Then, wait...what's going on? I can't see what's happening on stage. The band are playing along together, the crowd is cheering. Peter must be mucking around with something. Oh right, he's getting his talk box effect thingamajig ready. It appears at 7:22, oo baydo baydo boo...crowd cheer...bah do wah bo baba dah...crowd cheer...Peter you sound funny, I wanna thank you...I hope you have a good night...don't forget to come again real real soon (not sure about this last part). Some of it must just be Frampton going wah wahwah woo wow uh.

At 11:25, Frampton ditches the talk box with a big Woahwoww...then pulls out all the stops for one more mighty solo at 11:45 that lasts until the end, sending the crowd into spasms of joy.",1498348800,5

110647,3202,20400,"At this point you can't pretend that you bought a Roger Waters' album without knowing what to expect. You know he's going to critically examine war, politics, politicians, policies, and societal ills. This is something he has been doing in earnest since 1973's ""Dark Side of the Moon"". Same goes for making 'concept' albums, which ""Is This the Life We Really Want?"" (ITTLWRW) clearly is.

So, does 73 year old Waters have something fresh and new to say? No, but he is one of only a handful of musicians willing to continually comment on the current state of affairs, and for that, he immediately earns two stars. The trouble with Waters solo work is that it has lacked the musicianship from the rest of the Pink Floyd camp. Someone once said that Roger Waters was Pink Floyd's conscience, it's vision, it's lyrical poetry, whilst Gilmour, Wright and Mason were the architects, sound designers, and heart behind Waters' words. Nowhere is that more apparent that on ITTLWRW--the lyrics are spot on, but musically....well....the album is just so-so. Musically, there are no inspired moments, no innovative curves, no surprises sonically. So, after several listens, the music isn't all that memorable while what Waters is talking about resonates long after the music ends.

I'm not entirely certain as to why Waters felt the need after 25 years of silence to comment once more on current affairs. He pretty much addressed everything that needed addressing with 1992's ""Amused to Death"", or 1979's ""The Wall"" or 1977's ""Animals"". I want to be extremely clear here--I side with Waters' point of view, but that point of view isn't as effectively showcased with the music presented on ITTLWRW. I don't mind at all that Waters is a realist, a cynic, a pessimist, or what you will. I side with that view. He just should have brought the music to go with it this time, and he didn't. For that, I can't give this work five stars, or even four stars. It falls somewhere between three and three and a half stars for me.

That being said, I have to say that the final trilogy of songs here are some of Waters' most moving of his career--""Wait for Her"", ""Oceans Apart"", and ""A Part of Me Died"". Those, along with ""Broken Bones"" are my favorites here. They just aren't enough to push this album above three stars.

This very well could be the first and last time I write a critique on Roger Waters and/or Pink Floyd as it seems there may be nothing that follows in the future. I am not a big David Gilmour solo work fan, and so I will take this final opportunity to compare this current work with Roger Waters' and Pink Floyd's previous works.

110656,6491,20400,"Everyone is complaining about the political views and negative lyrics.  Since when did Roger Waters not speak of what was on his mind?  Roger has always had lots to say and was not afraid to put it to music.  Lets talk about the music here, 54 minutes of some really outstanding songs.

We need to remember this man made up 25%  of one of the greatest musical groups of our generation!  Pink Floyd, there has never been a group that is in the same league as these guys were and there never will be!

Roger Waters is like a fine wine, he gets better with age.  The sound effects, and all of the voices and talking between the songs is so Pink Floyd.  The  music flows in a very dreamy,  Pink Floyd style.  In June 2017 it almost seems like I am listening to a brand new Floyd release!  However, I do miss  David Gilmour's  signature guitar sounds!

If you are a fan of Roger Waters or of Pink Floyd you need to buy this at once!  This is great music to enjoy,  I cannot stop listening to it, very addicting!  There will be no Pink Floyd reunion soon, Roger Waters or David Gilmour solo releases are all were gonna get so enjoy!!

Remember, Mr. Waters is a musical legend!!  Let him speak his opinions whether you agree with him or not.  Please enjoy this for what it is, 54 minutes of some of the greatest music I have heard in 2017!",1498348800,5

110661,15774,20400,"It's been quite a while since Roger Waters has done an album.  Any political leanings aside, I suppose this album might be one of the positive outcomes of the Trump administration so far.

Is this The Life We Really Want? is a very politicized album.  Completely missing are Waters' usual cryptic metaphors and symbolism.  This album is very blunt about what Waters' views are on the current state of affairs here on Earth.

I'm going to ignore this polarizing topic and note why I really love this album.  It sounds very much like it came out of the mid-70s Pink Floyd era.  There are glimmers of Animals, Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here and the Wall all wrapped up in these songs.  I have to say it is a welcome feeling although it's also a very dark, moody feeling album as well.  Oddly the feel of it also reminds me of David Bowie's Aladdin Sane album.  I think it's the sparse syncopated drumming.

Roger's voice is sounding a bit more frail when he's screaming in his typical fashion but it's also deeper adding to the moody darkness of these songs.  The album is produced by Nigel Godrich who normally likes the voice front and center on his work but Roger's seems a little quiet in the mix of all the music.

Still it's a somber but pleasing album at the same time, mostly for it's nostalgic Pink Floyd feel to it.",1498348800,5

110666,17907,13384,"Betty Fox is a perennial favorite along the Southwest Coast of Florida.  In fact, theres hardly a blues venue anywhere in Florida that she hasn't played.  So this spanking new CDreleased June 29th! is sure to get a warm welcome from her many, many Florida fans.
The backup band is also top-notch: Kid Royal, guitar; Barry Williams, bass; Sam Farmer, drums, and Shawn Brown on keys.  Kid Royals work is featured throughout the set.  Hes given free rein especially on the Otis Redding chestnut, Remember Me, the longest piece in the set.  Betty also adds her own unique interpretation to this piece which is one of the few songs in this set that was NOT written by Betty and her band members.

To say Bettys style is unique is an understatement.  Her vocal range is as wide as it is deep.  She can do scat like Ella and gut-wrenching emotion like Joplin. Slow Burn is an example of her flexible voice as well as her poignant, emotional, and regret-filled interpretations.  Hers is a voice that can cry, moan, beg and shriek, all in the same cut.

Thats not to say she cant do justice to a light-hearted and bouncy cut like Please Come Home.  Our Love is a slow, solid rocker about the kind of love that can turn grey skies into blue.  Sweet Memories, on the other hand, tells of a love gone wrong, and a broken heart that has nothing left but bitter-sweet memories.

Perhaps one of the best cuts on this disc is that old Willie Nelson standard, Angel Flying Too Close to the Ground, which gives Fox plenty of space to stretch and bend the words and the melody to match her own gut feelings.  This piece also spotlights Kid Royals sensitive, moody, and emotional guitar work.

For Betty Fox fans, this is the collection youve been waiting for.  For everyone else, its a great introduction to a bona fide Florida blues treasure.

One interesting thing I've noticed about ""The Breakdown"" is that at the 3:08 mark, the accordion solo does a riff that sounds a lot like a riff from ""Come Dancing"" by The Kinks, which was released the year prior. Don't know if it's coincidence or not, but if it's intentional, it works really well in the context of the song.",1498435200,5

110708,17907,8562,"Hard Road to Hoe
By
Ghost Town Blues Band

Whether its performing or producing, Matt Isbell does not do things with half a heart.  This is a well-produced CD with a plethora of sidemen and women, all working together to come up with another Memphis-sound rocker.  The instrumentation includes a grand piano, two organs, sax, trombone, mouth harp, bass, drums, a shovel, and something called an electric-analog broom.  Dont ask.  And don't jump to the wrong conclusion, either.  This is not some kind of novelty set done for laughs.  Far from it.  This is Memphis blues at its rocking, driving best.

Most of the songs were written by Isbell and most of the guitar work is by Isbell, too, and that includes slide guitar as well as a three-string cigar box model.  Slashing and poundingwith a bit of reverb is Matts guitar-picking style.  Most of the cuts are up-tempo, urged on by the hard driving drum work of Preston McEwen who also helped in the production.

Brandon Santini sits in for a couple cuts.  He sings and plays the mouth harp on Tip of My Hat and My Doggy.  If you listen closely to the Doggy cut you just might be able to hear Marry Dog Isbell featured on the howls. Big Shirley is a boogie-shuffle number about a babe who is six foot tall and four foot wide.

Tied My Worries to a Stone is full-throated, raw, and growly.  Dead Sea tells of the trials and tribulations of a love that brings more pain than joy.  Nothin But Time is a slow and soulful tale about a dude whose baby left behind that gut-wrenching throw-away line, cant we be friends?

Rounding out this well-constructed set is Road Still Drives the Same a good old-fashioned drinking song about lost loves and painful memories: Sometimes Life really is one helluva Hard Road to Hoe, the writer is saying.  But theres really only one thing to do about that.  You just have to brush off the dust, and keep on hoeing.

110730,1210,20145,Neil Diamond has spanned generations of fans for decades.  Serenade was his 9th album and a continued beginning into areas he apparently wanted to pursue in broadening his talent.  I am thrilled he did.  This is one of my most treasured of his albums / cd's.  I have the vinyl of it as well and purchased that when it hit the street in 1974.  The CD is today's more flavorful version of that album and I treasure it just as much as the vinyl.  Many songs on the album have become my favorites over the years just as his early works for Bang Records put him as a mainstream entertainer so many years ago.  He is a master at his trade and this album is just a part of it.  Don't miss it ~ it's a Jewel !,1498521600,5

Rolling Stone Magazine lists ""Like a Rolling Stone"" as the greatest rock song of all time. No, it's not a real rocker, but it is excellent and been copied by a myriad of musicians including David Bowie and The Rolling Stones. It is a must have for any comprehensive collection.",1498521600,5
110738,1792,3052,"This song is about the reaction from many people when one of the band members criticized the president of the US and the invasion of Iraq. Dixie Chicks faced a lot of blowback in about 2003 due to not backing down from this stance in a time when it was very unpopular.

110758,5885,1566,"One thing I decisively disapprove from these collections is that most piece of music is not what I want. Such pieces may be called THE 50 GREATEST according to the publishing business that produces and sells the CD, but not according to my standards.

However, I must admit that I squeezed a good number of extraordinary pieces that elevate my senses when the London Philharmonic Orchestra exquisitely plays them. Some of those pieces of Classical Music includes the London Choir both of which transport me to wonderful state of mind.

Should you have the qualities necessary, these collection is worth acquiring even if you have to set aside some pieces of music that you may not want to hear.

Lastly, I must say that I agree with reviewer Ms. Kelly. I will add to her words that those who are SERIOUS about Classical Music ~but not FANATICS~ would likely pay more for this collection delivered in much higher quality .mp3 files.",1498521600,5

110767,17957,4237,This flash in the pan of a hit certainly had its season in the sun. It had the uncommon combination of having a very cool usage of minor notes in combination with a refrain using major notes while wrapping it all around a heart breaker of a story. The song ushered in the early part of the seventies and in a sense is a time capsule item of that time period. I lost a classmate around the time it came out so the song had special force to it for me.,1498521600,5

110769,17957,5333,"Hardcore Led Zeppelin fans will disagree with me, but Nobody's Fault But Mine is a standout hit on the Presence album. Presence just doesn't grab me like the other earlier albums. This hit, however is a match for the best of them. I may come back and modify my comments about presence after after listening to the album a couple of times. Led Zeppelin can grow on you. That certainly happened to me with Led Zeppelin 3. At any rate, Nobody's Fault But Mine is an excellent cut and you won't be sorry for having it.",1498521600,5
110770,5777,6731,"One of the most iconic songs by one of the most legendary singers of blues music ever. John Lee Hooker was one of those trailblazers of blues music that would go on to influence many of the great rock and roll singers and groups of the 1960's. With his gravelly voice and destrictive guitar playing ""Boom Boom"" is Hooker's most well known blues tune. A great song to listen to and download.",1498521600,5
110771,5696,20400,"Roger hits a new low here!  I guess I seen this one coming after hearing about his 4th divorce, recent negative interviews, political bashing, anti Jew/Isreal stuff, and even negative comments about David Gilmour, angry rants, and bashing Trump and others at the recent live shows.  This guy is one angry grumpy old man.  But I could have forgiven all that for a great new album after all it's only the music I really care about in the end. But tons of political stuff, F bombs, bad language, and some pretty good songs toward the beginning of the album ruined by profanity.  Deja Vu is the only song I like because at least he made that song without saying the F word 7-8 times throughout.  But it's also ironic that he talks about what he would have done had he been God (yet he's a professed atheist).  Toward the end of the album when he finally stops cursing, every song runs together (slow, generic boring numbers).  Wait For Her, Oceans Apart, and Part Of Me Died sound like the same song and stuff that could have easily been put on the weakest Floyd record The Final Cut.  After the brilliant Amused To Death 25 years ago this is what we get.  Oh well, we will always have the classic Floyd albums he helped make and a couple MUCH better solo albums!",1498521600,1

110818,10170,2584,"I have survived for almost 20 years strictly on Strange Brew - The Very Best Of. Then I realized that I don't have any of those long blues rock jams that they were famous for. Wheels Of Fire seemed like a good prospect to get the long live version of Spoonful, but I already had all of the other good songs. I kept looking and this very good compilation has all of Strange Brew and some more studio cuts on the first disc, with the second disc being all live to include the long version of Spoonful from Wheels Of Fire. The second live disc alone is worth the price of purchase. As for some of the studio cuts on the first disc that one never hears on the radio, well there is a good reason for that. These cuts only show how experimental this group got to be and that they also considered themselves to be a psychedelic band just as much as a blues rock jam band. It is a shame that they only lasted for a couple of years. It is hard to believe that these recordings are almost 50 years old.",1498608000,4

This was done in the past with tracks such as Barrel of a Gun (released exactly two decades before this single) having a handful of remixes.

110836,18270,20476,"Johann Sebastian Bachs concertos rank among my favorites of all his works. I have listened to several renditions of Bachs clavier concertos over the years, and I believe that Murray Perahia - Bach Piano Concertos"" from Sony Classical is unquestionably the best Ive ever heard.

Murray Perahia - Bach Piano Concertos combines three earlier compact discs into one album containing all of Bachs keyboard concertos. Running to nearly three hours of playing time, the music is exquisite. Murray Perahia and the Academy of St Martin in the Fields, which he conducts from his grand piano, perform with tremendous virtuosity, completely capturing the essence of each one of Bachs clavier masterworks.  Audio is clear and crisp, and is perfectly balanced between soloist and orchestra.

Id like to add a word or two about Perahias use of a piano instead of a harpsichord for these performances. Bach originally intended his clavier concertos for the harpsichord, and the trend in recent years has been to perform them on that instrument. Perahia, who is widely considered one of the greatest concert pianists of all time, addressed this issue in a 2008 interview with Geoffrey Norris of the British newspaper The Daily Telegraph. Perahia said, ""When I was growing up, the wisdom was that the piano wasn't the right vehicle for Bach. I felt that this had to be wrong, because, first of all, Bach is very important for any pianist, simply from the point of knowing about counterpoint, structure and harmony."" Perahia went on to say that Bach had made a profound effect on many later composers who wrote and performed for the piano: ""I don't think there was a day when Chopin wasn't playing Bach. When Schumann went into depression, he wrote fugues, and he always told his wife, Clara, to study Bach. It was an important part of their musical make-up,"" Perahia said in his interview with Norris.

Although Bach intended his magnificent keyboard concertos for the harpsichord, they certainly translate beautifully to the piano  as Murray Perahia attests to perfection in his performances contained in Murray Perahia -  Bach Piano Concertos. This is simply one of the best albums of Bachs music  I've ever heard. Most highly recommended.",1498694400,5

The sound quality on the streaming version of this is pretty good. Since its' mostly rap with the instrumentation being a background sound any loss of fidelity is totally acceptable to me on a streaming version.

110869,17119,9592,"This is a seriously cool sounding song!  The first time I heard it was last night though.  My husband and I were talking about my two pairs of pants I bought this week for church, and I told him I was totally going for the more pant like set first because darn it, I've read the scriptures (read them daily even) and there's nowhere in them that says ""Woman, thou shalt only wear skirts to church.""  But it's become such an ingrained part of the social metaphorical yardstick of faithfulness people like to measure you against in our church that despite what people see me doing every week with our son, it's going to be seen as scandalous to the point of heresy by some when I show up this Sunday...and I don't think it should be that way.  I think we should just love people, because loving them works a lot better and feels a lot better then judging them. But that's just my opinion on the subject.

And probably most people won't say anything to my face, but experience has taught me the rat-a-tat-tat of the firing squad will probably be making the rounds behind my back.  And as we were talking about this, my husband said, ""So you're like the color of boom.""  And I said, ""Que?"" because I'd totally never heard this song, and then I quipped, ""no, I'm more like the color of ka-boom""  As in fireworks, because I'm not just loud, I'm also glittery and sparkly all at the same time ;)  And he said, no babe, you totally have to listen to this song (because he'd had it on prime music on his phone) because this sounds like you...and I just laughed as I listened, because he's totally right.  And then I bought the song.

I realize the lyrics can have some different interpretations, but I think it also speaks a lot towards people who feel like they might just be out of sync with the people around them because maybe they're the neon color in the box of primary and secondary colored crayons.  Or the one with glitter and sparkles. And maybe like me, they have trouble coloring in the lines, but their heart is in the best possible places, right?  So I love this song, totally love it, and it made my day better.  And I'm going to be struggling to be singing hymns in my head and not this song when I walk through the doors on Sunday.

I'm guessing that it comes from the fact that this song, lyrics aside is a masterfully crafted hit of a song that carries emotion to match the lyrics. It is a very angry song but at the same time, it is a very liberating song. Without saying it explicitly, the song appears to be by a man, not an American, who is jaded by a recent relationship with an American woman. Since Burton Cummings is Canadian this would be an appropriate vantage point from which he might write. If you've ever felt used and unjustly dumped, this would be your choice of angry songs.

You don't have to like Country Music to like this song. It is hilarious, it is fun, it draws you in, and at the end of the day, it is indeed essential Johnny Cash. It is truly one of those performances that have become Americana. Johnny Cash was truly a national treasure. No comprehensive music collection should be without it.",1498867200,5

What is interesting is that the actual concept for the song came from seeing people on a ship trying to stay up while the ship tossed in the waves. It looked like they were trying to ""Walk like those old Pharaoh Egyptians. At any rate, this song is a whole lot of fun at 1980's parties because someone who remembers will inevitably attempt the Egyptian walk.",1498953600,5

You may remember the Manfred Man Earth Band;s hit, ""Blinded By The Light."" That song was actually written by Bruce Springsteen. Not many have connected with young people of the 70s and 80s and their lifestyle, their hopes and dreams and fears quite like Springsteen.

I can't help but smile when I hear the opening chords of this song. It is also a bit naughty without rolling into inappropriate so it can be quite a flirty song to having playing when the right person is around.

Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, the namesake cut from its album, is not only a fine tune in its own right but is one of the best hits to come out of the 1970s. Many critics consider this gold blockbuster to be Elton John's finest song. It is an amazing song but in my opinion, Elton John did a number of hits equally as good. Nevertheless, this is an essential hit sung in ballad form.",1498953600,5

The Japanese riff refrain is very catchy and as if that's not enough, it causes plenty of spicy talk about what it means to say one is turning Japanese.

I will go so far as to say it is essential to any comprehensive Rock N' Roll collection.

111073,7818,20489,"Pros: Cool unplugged versions of Avril classics; rare; raw

Cons: Just and E.P., maybe a little too short in my opinion

Last night I was watching Avril Lavigne have a prank pulled on her on the MTV show Punk'd.  She was crying because she was so scared.  I guess she ain't so tough, is she?  Yeah, no matter how many middle fingers she'd like to flash at cameras and in general, she's just really a harmless pussycat.  Still she has an image to put forth, no matter how silly it may seem.  I have to resign myself to the fact that just about anyone's music I listen to is going to disappoint me on a personal level, whether it is religion, politics, middle fingers, or anything else.  It's hard to separate the music from the a--hole, but if we're going to be fans of music then it's a necessity.

Almost six years ago to the day, Avril released this EP as an exclusive to Target.  It consists of six songs that mainly promote her Under My Skin CD's best songs, which was released a little over a month before.  The music was recorded live during a Canadian mall tour, dubbed the Live and By Surprise tour.  These days, of course it's impossible to find this CD available at Target stores, so if you decided you would need one too, you'd have to go to eBay and Amazon and pick it up for a pretty decent price.

He Wasn't starts off the CD, and it sounds like a rough recording taken from the soundboard.  This is not to say that it doesn't sound fantastic, because it does.  Her voice has no effects, the guitars sound effectively pure and the mix makes for a really nice sounding CD.  Her band consisted of just her and best friend/then-guitarist Evan Taubenfeld on two acoustic guitars and with Evan helping with the backing vocals.  The two perform a convincing unplugged version of these new songs, although Avril's vocal sounds relatively lethargic and void of the emotion compared to the original.  The audience can be heard a bit in the background, which help the songs have a slightly fuller sound.  He Wasn't is originally a hard rock/pop song with loud guitars, but they make it work, as they make sure they harmonize on the vocals in all the right spots.

My favorite song off of Under My Skin was My Happy Ending.  It has such addictive hooks and the lyrics were terrifically inspired.  Evan's harmony is out of key once or twice, but it still has an endearing quality to it.  The unplugged version is pretty much a carbon copy of the heavier original, except performed with acoustic guitars.  She goes back to her first album, Let Go only once and tackles Sk8ter Boi, which unlike My Happy Ending is pretty different from the original, especially the intro.  The audience doesn't even know what song it is until Avril begins singing the first lines  He was a boy, she was a girl...  On the back of the CD, it says that this track was from 2003, I suppose that maybe this was performed at another mall tour.

Don't Tell Me may work better as an acoustic number.  The guitar work between Evan and Avril in the intro sounds inspired as if the song's genesis was possibly born on these very two acoustic guitars.  Avril's vocal always sounds effortlessly splendid, and this is no exception, but here on Don't Tell Me she added the necessary emotional factor to effectively get this track across in the live atmosphere.  I tend to get a bit miffed at Avril all over again when I hear her perform this song as well as My Happy Ending.  These two singles are edited for radio because you never know who is listening, plus FCC laws prohibit.  I think she should have applied the same edited version when performing these songs in a public place like the mall for goodness sakes.  I know you're thinking, come on scapp70, it's only the a-word and the s-word.  I still find it inappropriate to hear these words amplified in your local mall.  If I was there with my son, I know I would have been pretty pissed off.

Take Me Away was not released as one of the singles from Under My Skin, but it's still one of the fan favorites.  Nobody's Home was the third single released, and it's my second favorite from the Under My Skin album, but my favorite from the Acoustic Live EP.  Many singers do not try and tackle the falsetto voice in a live setting, as it could sound weak, and it's a bit easier to go off-key when using it.  Avril's use of it gives her an exposed feel, and it shows a sweeter side of the artist.  She has a beautiful falsetto, one that rivals great singer's such as Olivia Newton-John even in her heyday.  I wish she would use it more, but then again her style of music doesn't call for it much.

This is not Avril's only EP by the way.  She had made two others, one for each studio album.  The first one from 2003 is called Angus Drive EP, which featured four songs, and the last one was called Control Room - Live EP that contains six tracks, including Sk8ter Boi again and a Sarah McLachlan cover called Adia.  So far, this is the only one I've collected and it's very cool to own this in addition/companion to her studio album.  If you're a fan of Avril Lavigne music, like me, you'll enjoy having alternative versions of the songs you already like on hand.

Finally, our buddy James Taylor and ""Shower The People"" proved to be acceptable to our teachers and faculty. The real irony is that Taylor's lyric ""if it feels nice, don't think twice"" made it right past their censor noses. I chuckle about that to this day.

Cons: Free, maybe All The Critics too.

1999 was Prince's first US Top Ten album. It is his fifth release, and it has gone on to sell around ten million copies worldwide. This is Prince's 1982 breakthrough album that launched him into the big time and started him on the path to super-stardom, as his mega smash Purple Rain album and movie were his next musical moves two years later in 1984.

 For this album, Prince renamed his band Prince and the Revolution in lieu of the go it alone Prince that his first four albums toted. His first four albums sold modestly well, breaking into the top 40 twice, and his singles did even worse, besides his one hit I Wanna Be Your Lover from his second album, Prince from 1979.
 On his first four albums, Prince could really only be heard singing in his soulful falsetto. The 1999 album is the first where he sings full-throated on every song.

 The opening song is the title track, 1999. The song reached a very respectable #12 in the US singles charts, and even better in the R&B and Dance singles charts. The song is kind of divided up vocally in the same way Stevie Wonder had done with You Are the Sunshine of My Life. First voice you hear is that of keyboardist, Lisa Coleman, then guitarist Dez Dickerson sings the next line, and then Prince will sing the third song. On the fourth line they will all harmonize together. The beat is a rock/dance mix set to apocalyptic lyrics about the New Year's Eve 1999, the last day we humans will be alive because of the imminent cold war destruction we face in the year 2000. Prince declares he will live life to the fullest during this last year, and especially on that fateful day of New Year's Eve. Prince's 1982 idea of living life is having sex and dancing to his own music. That ideology is the basis for the whole album actually, so this opening track makes the perfect choice for title track.

1999 quietly segues into Prince's first Top Ten hit, Little Red Corvette, reaching #6 in the US Pop singles charts. The song has crossed over into classic status. Once in a while I'll even hear it on a classic rock station. This is one of Prince's most well-known songs, his inclusion of the song in the acoustic segment of his Musicology tour was a highlight. The song is very pop rock, not really a dance song at all. The guitar solo provided by Dez is good, but not Prince caliber. When Dez left after this album, Prince mostly handled all of the guitar solos himself. Dez could be seen in Prince's first film Purple Rain performing at First Avenue.

 Prince had another top ten hit with the next song Delirious. The song reached number 8 in the US Pop singles charts. When I first heard the song, I thought it was too silly and poppy for my tastes. The song quickly grew on me, it's so much fun to sing along and tap a toe to. It's the shortest song on the album clocking in at only 4 minutes. The song has a loopy wavy keyboard riff that commands you to get silly. Even though it's silly time with Prince, the song is as addictive as any of the great songs on this album.

Let's Pretend We're Married is one of my favorites. The fast drumbeat and artificial bass is the backdrop for deliberately slow melody line sung by Prince. The song is very upbeat, poppy and happy - so the erotic lyrics are sort of camouflaged by the song's happy mood.
 Even the ""f"" word is uttered more than once in this song, but it's all in fun - in a 1982 sort of way. This was also released as a single, but it couldn't break the top 40 on any of the US singles charts, stalling at #52 in the Pop Singles charts.

Now, there's no hiding the fact that D.M.S.R. is just down right the nastiest song on the album. The song has a deep and raw bass and bass synthesizer that crank up the funk factor to 11. The keyboards and guitars accent the bass and lyrics masterfully. The song is a dance party, and the fact that the song lasts over eight minutes it will last for a good part of it. The lyrics demand participation...

 It took me a while to buy the CD for 1999, even though it is such a great album. I held on to my double vinyl album for a while because the single CD released was missing a song, D.M.S.R., because CDs were only 75 minutes back then. When CDs were manufactured with a slightly longer running time at 80 minutes, 1999 was re-released. I always wondered who was the genius who chose to leave off D.M.S.R. instead of a lesser song.

 Speaking of lesser songs, Free is thrown into the middle of the album song list, and it really destroys the whole idea that this is a perfect album. It's not the song is awful; it's just not good enough to be appreciated amongst the rest of the other songs. It's a piano ballad, and it has a couple of slight hooks, but it just doesn't work. This is a smutty, sexual dance, rock funk album, and Free just doesn't go with that flow.

 Speaking of smutty sex songs, Automatic is one of the best. The lyrics are what do it for me, they're honest and bare. They talk about raw feelings about obsession, lust and desperation.  The song runs almost ten minutes long, it's hypnotically amazing, and sometimes it seems too short, believe it or not. The song has an intoxicatingly beat that refuses to deviate, but the melody on top of it changes here and there throughout the song. The song has many parts, yet still with that single beat, it's a great effect. This song is epic, and is surely one of those deep cuts, those rare Prince songs that not too many people know, but if and when they stumble upon it, it's like a buried treasure filled with riches.

Automatic and Something in the Water (Does Not Compute) were always like sister songs to me. They don't sound alike, but the sexually erotic and desperate honest theme is rampant in both songs. The sixteenth note high-hat is constant, and again Prince deliberately sings at a much slower pace against the super fast high-hat. The lyrics tend to be about self-evaluation, since he is not getting the response from women he thinks he should be getting. The song has a very high emotive quality, especially in the parts where Prince screeches those amazing screams that only he can do. Lots of echo and in these two songs add to the erotic ambience of these last two songs effectively. These both are my favorite two songs on the album.

Lady Cab Driver is probably as smutty as Prince gets on this album, complete with squeaking bed sounds and all. Prince wears his falsetto voice again for the most part of this song. The Revolution delivers a very groovy and funky beat. The verses of this song sort of remind me of Tom Tom Club's first album. The story of the lyrics is about Prince hailing a taxi and at the end of the ride making love to the cab driver. While he's doing her, he spews his frustrations orally as well as sexually.

All the Critics Love U in New York is just a little bit better than Free. It's another big funk fest of bass and drums, but the melody line is uninspired and falls flat. It's too bad, because there's some real good bass playing here.

 The CD ends with International Lover. This song has a classic slow Motown type of groove, with funky smut lyrics. Prince is your pilot, and watch out when your board, because Prince is not only going to fly you to another country, but he'll rock your world. The plane is called the Seduction 747, again it sounds corny, but it works I suppose because only someone like Prince can pull a song like this off. This Prince song may have crossed the line; this is more like the Prince on Saturday Night Live portrayed by the hilarious Fred Armisen.

The album is a big dance party, yet eclectic. It rocks pretty hard when it tries, yet has some corny moments. It is the perfect predecessor for Prince's next venture which was Purple Rain. It is a new beginning after the first four albums. It's the beginning of the Prince career we all loved for a little while there in the 80s, and the snippets of genius we see even today by his recent released. It's the start of all things purple lyrically and visually. This is a great place to begin your exploration of Prince knowledge. If you need to learn about the earlier stuff, get the 1993 greatest compilation called The Hits/B-Sides, it pretty much sums it up.

 Pop/Country mega star Taylor Swift had really hit it big right from the debut. Her first album Taylor Swift was released in 2006, and has been in the Top 200 since. In 2008, Taylor had been hard at work getting her new album Fearless out in time for the fall, but her fans kept requesting some new music. Unlike every other music artist, Swift obliged with this EP, Beautiful Eyes. Its a six-track CD that includes two new songs, one rare bonus track and three reworked favorites from her debut. If this wasn't enough, she included a bonus DVD with videos for every song on the CD (except for I Heart ?) plus the remaining two promotional videos from Taylor Swift, and more and all at a very low price. Of course these days, the price had risen substantially as Taylor only wanted a certain number of discs released, making this EP now a very sought after rarity.

 The CD starts off with the title track Beautiful Eyes, a light pop song flavored to country perfection. Admittedly, these are not the best lyrics from Swift, but the atmospheric pedal steel guitar makes up for the rushed lyrics. It took me a few listens before I fell in love with the track but eventually Taylors femininely soft vocals combined with the magical ambiance finally seeped into my soul. Its one of her oldest songs, as she performed this song live in 2005, a year before her debut was released. Shouldve Said No (alternate version) is a different version than the one that is found on her debut. This version is shorter by about twenty seconds and the electric guitars are stripped away, leaving the skeleton of the more country version.

 Easily, the best song from this EP is Teardrops On My Guitar (Acoustic Version). This is also from her debut album, and here we have a slightly shorter version, yet with only Taylors voice alone with a single acoustic guitar gives it a much more intimate feel. The lyrics kind of run along the same storyline that her future smash single You Belong With Me travels on. Picture To Burn is the last from her debut album. This says that this version is the radio edit. I cant really decipher the difference between the two versions. They are basically the same to my ears; perhaps the production is a bit tinnier which would be friendly for the radio format. This song is upbeat and the heaviest song on this EP, Taylors lyrics are a bit more venomous than usual towards the boy in question, and her faux southern accent is even raised in all of her womanly ire.

 Taylor has released three full-length albums so far, and even since the very beginning she struck some exclusive deals with different stores like Target or Wal-Mart and give her fans a choice between what kind of bonus material would be tacked on the end of her album on the bonus disc. Taylors always writing songs, so most of the time shell give the fans newly recorded music as bonus material. The best of these is the bonus songs on her Fearless album, the Platinum Edition where the bonus tracks outshined the album itself. The next song, Im Only Me When Im With You is one of the bonus songs from Taylor Swift. This is the most country song out of the bunch here, with fiddles blazing right up front along with pedal steel and banjo. The last song I Heart ?, on the CD is possibly the oldest here, written when she was just 14. The lyrics are about a relationship break-up once again, but Im not sure I understand the I Heart ? reference she makes in the chorus. If her ex can see that she had written I Heart ? on the back of her hand, then she wins. I write a question mark on the back of my brain because Im not sure how or what she wins here, but it ultimately doesnt matter because the song is an excellent way to end the CD.

 So while Taylor gives us almost a twenty-minute EP, the DVD is nearly an hour. It contains all of the promotional videos from her debut album, including Tim McGraw and Our Song. We go behind the scenes with the making of the Picture To Burn video. For the video of Beautiful Eyes, we have a compilation of video snippets from Taylors birthday party, where Kellie Pickler makes a starring appearance in the video. I love that she included the GAC (Great American Country) channel special about herself being featured in the New Artist special, and she included about fifteen minutes of that. Last but not least is her performance of Shouldve Said No taken from the Academy of Country Music Award show from 2008, which was probably the most recent thing at the time of this release.

 Not only does Taylor give us quality stuff, but also in this case a huge quantity of entertainment for her fans, and I am one of them. This CD usually goes for a lot, but I knew I had to get it. I was lucky enough to get it for under $15, but if you are as big a fan as I am, and you don't have this, it is worth it to even pay double if you have to. Taylor is an amazing artist and probably the best song writer around today, I cant wait to see what she gives us next.

111130,14947,15888,"Peter Gabriels So is one of the best albums of the 1980s and holds up well after more than three decades (far better than this reviewer did). While Sledgehammer, In Your Eyes and Big Time rightfully remain radio standards, there are other great tunes on the album, including powerful ballads like Dont Give Up with Kate Bush and Mercy Street. While it was certainly a well known song when released, Red Rain has faded in popularity it seems. Too bad since its a great song and an excellent track to introduce the album. That Voice Again is pleasant but not memorable. If theres a downside to the album, its the ending. We Do What We're Told and This Is The Picture (Excellent Birds) have their charms to be sure but they are not going to be everyones cup of tea. Despite that, this is the album people associate with Gabriel, one of the brightest lights of his era and a musical genius at the height of his powers when he crafted this superb album.

It has displays a masterful combination of minor note chords playing against major tone chords along with a perfectly complementary harmonic vocals.

The song features opera chorus music and innovative choral arrangements not usually found in a Rock N Roll format. The timing is magnificent and when the electric guitars enter the scene they really cut loose with wild abandon with ferocious vocals to boot. This is a great song that I sometimes stop to appreciate. Because it got so much play, I actually avoided the song for awhile but today I find myself able to enjoy it anew.

The 2 pre ""Pet Sounds"" albums after Brian decided to work on music from home and use the ""Wrecking Crew"" and more diverse instrumentation. While ""Today"" is more twee and looking towards ""Pet Sounds"" emotionally with songs like ""She Knows Me Too Well"", ""Please Let Me Wonder"" and ""Kiss Me Baby"" and ""Summer Days and Summer Nights"" is the final summer time americana fun - especially ""Amusement Parks USA"" which reminds me of spending time each summer on the Jersey board. :Salt Lake City"" is a super fun one with bizarre lryics. It's like a post card for their 12 Salt Lake City fans. It's just awesome with its diverse instrumentation of baritone saxes,keys and xylophones.""Girls Don't Tell Me"" is a Carl led (a rarity at the time) guitar led Beatles esque acoustic number with driving rhythm's that remind one of ""Help"" and ""Rubber Soul"". While the melody is decent enough, the song sounds unfinished and is not really all that great. ""Help Me Rhonda"" is one of those classic early Beach Boy singles like ""I Get Around"" that stick in your head forever. ""California Girls"" is mind blowing. The second verse backup/harmony vocals are what really does it for me, and of course the intro is legendary. ""Let Him Run Wild"" is a great melody, and is ace.",1499731200,5

I know that most people prefer the pop-ish songs like Kryptonite, but for me I love songs like Down Poison, which have a distinctively darker edge.  This album is missing that.  If you like the pop-ish songs you might like this album, but if you don't I wouldn't get it.",1499817600,2

111223,12932,13795,"Eh, this is not Mr. Connick Jr at his best - ceding creative control to outside producers/collaborators isn't necessarily a bad idea... but in this case the results, which try to place Harry in a more contemporary setting, are often too generic and bland. By the way, if you're looking for the crooner stuff that he does so well, this probably isn't your record. Might've worked better had Connick stuck with Eg White for the entire record, instead of splitting production duties with Butch Walker. The Walker tracks, recorded with a full band lineup, are more conventional. It's on the White-produced tracks that Harry steps outside his comfort zone.

There are nice moments - including the worthy hooks in the exuberant album opener ""(I Like It When You) Smile"" and the adventurous closer, ""Right Where It Hurts."" Other highlights: the laid-back ""(I Do) Like We Do"" and ""Tryin' To Matter."" It's just that some of the weaker moments could've benefited from more of the energy Connick brings to his ""poppier"" albums. Connick does display his underappreciated versatility throughout, adding his own drumming and horn playing to his usual keys.

There's a retailer-specific version that contains two exclusive bonus tracks - both of which are better that several cuts on the main album (including the title track which, yes, we not included on the standard edition). I didn't realize this originally, which led me to buy the album twice! Glad I did because ""That Would Be Me"" and ""You'll Be Back"" are great tunes.",1499817600,3

I have not taken notes on which ones I liked or disliked because I simply do not have the time or patience. I will say that fans of this conductor, as I am, even with misgivings about individual performances, will enjoy this pianist/conductor's usual individualistic mixture of often powerful straightforward musicality and willful, eccentric quirks that have kept his recordings since adolescence so interesting, whether he flops, scores or, more often, provides a mix.

111308,17420,3284,"An essential Beach Boys purchase. A fantastic jawl dawg sneeeshhhtt set First of all, the remastering is fantastic. Way better than the 2001ish 2fers and on par with the 2011ish mono and stereo remasters. A lot of their albums are only available still in the early 2000's inferior sounding 2fers, so this is the only way to get a large portion of the catalog with sufficient remastering. There are also a number of great rarities and an overall very good song selection for the most part. A great book, and there is really nothing not to like here other than a handful of song choices, which is impossible not to happen and with that considered its a great choice. Right from the beginning the BB's are choice. ""Surfin"" the first single, is fantastic early R & R. Mike Love really shines here and on ""Surfin Safari"". Also Dennis Wilson's punky drums are super fun and compact. Clearly its great Brian expanded the Beach Boys and started using far more advanced chords and harmony, and of course the Wrecking Crew. Both versions are great, even if the real, real early days were limited in some ways technically, at there best are great in their way. ""Lonley Sea"" from ""Surfin USA"" album is the first song by Brian Wilson that is pointing the direction to ""Pet Sounds"". The next track to do so, is the fantastic ""In My Room"". Some of the early songs could be considered chessy but their is almost always some sort of strange brilliance bringing them closer to quirky art than generic cheese. Case in point; ""Be True to your School"". ""Catch a Wave"" is probably my favorite of the early surfing songs. Brian's ""Cause you don't just have to put it down"" in falsetto is classic. The fact these guys couldn't surf. really adds a great dorky art pop side to things, that make these songs more about an energy or vibe around the idea of the beach and surfin, rather than songs for people who actually surf. They also made song car songs In addition to the California style beach related songs. After Brian Wilsons nervous breakdown on an airplane in 1964, he stayed home to work on music while the boys were on tour. This of course is the halcyon years of the Beach Boys. ""Summer Days and Summer Nights"" and ""Today!"" the first two albums with Brian at home, and using the Wrecking Crew far far more than before are filled with sneeeshhtt dawgs classics. The LSD extravaganza ""California Girls"" with its amazing introduction and heavenly background vocals on the second verse are legendary. ""Salt Lake City"" is another one of those really akward/cringe worthy sets of lryics that are completely redeemed by the music, arrangement and performance. ""Let Him Run Wild"" was Dennis Wilson's favorite Beach Boys song of all time (at least at the time of the 1976ish interview I saw) and it's fantastic Brian meets wrecking crew slow burn jawl pop dawg song. ""Help Me Rhonda"" is Alan Jardine big single to sing. ""Today!"" is looking towards ""Pet Sounds"" far more"". ""Please Let Me Wonder"" is one Brians very best vocal performances ever and ""She Knows Me Too Well"" is another song in the tender tradition of pre ""Pet Sounds"" tender Brian songs like ""Lonley Sea"", ""In My Room"" and ""Warmth of the Sun"". Dennis really starts coming into his own a lead singer with ""Do You Wanna Dance?"" and especially with the underatted ""In the Back of my Mind"". The latter is one of the most complicated pre Sounds/Smile Beach Boys songs and Dennis gets to sing lead, and he sounds great (you must check out his solo album ""Pacific Ocean Blue"" from Jawl 70's). Of course at this point comes ""Pet Sounds"" and we all know about jawl. ""Smile"" comes next and you all know bout jawl dawg. There aren't any songs from ""Smiley Smile"" here from what I can remember and if that is indeed the case, its kind of a shame because it should atleast be represented by a song or two, like ""Little Pad"". Actually ""Wonderful"" is from ""Smiley Smile"", not what I would have chose to represent jawl albums. 'Wild Honey"" is next and is well represented and contains first time ever stereo mixes. The full album is now released in stereo in the recent 2 cd release ""1967"" (recommended dawgs). Its a fun album, and does away the Wrecking Crew and you can hear that's its the boys playing said jawl instruments, sometimes for worse, sometimes for the better"".  I would have liked them to include the Belle & Sebastian proto track ""Arent You Glad"", but o well. The underatted 1968 album ""Friends"" is next. An extended ""Meant for You"" is included. its effect is quite different from its orginal length around 1 minute. Not that its much longer, but its extra length is interesting, if not sneeshhtt essential. ""Busy Doing Nothing"" is Brian's bossa nova song, that really shows his state of mind and life style at the time. Stating with ""Smiley Smile"" Brian wasn't really singing lead as the only lead singer. There starts to be a lot of Mike singer a line, Brian sings a build up line, then Carl sings the chorus (like ""Arent You Glad"" for examples jawl),so ""Busy Doing Nothing"" is a bit of rarity for the time, a full on Brian song - that could have been on a solo album at the time. A classic. At the time of ""Friends, Brian, seems to be in a decent enough frame of mind. It's kind of a mysterious time. It's a little undocumented and kind of forgotten unfortunately. ""20/20"" is next with the jawl proto sneeeshht attempt of 'Do it Again"". Its a successful attempt at another ""Catch a Wave"" type of song, even with Brian falsetto on chorus. continued jawl latters dawgs boi boi.",1499990400,5

111353,1989,15991,"Never listened to Rihanna before.  Heard this song at the credits after an episode of ""Girls"" (HBO).  It has a hypnotic rhythm, chorus, and lyrics that captured my attention, and made me a new fan.",1500249600,5
111354,3161,19908,"I am a big fan of Leonard Cohen, but I don't care for his earlier albums.  Not being a fan of any folk music, regardless of lyrics, I have always preferred other ways for singer/songwriters to compose.  Of course, that's my personal preference, and in no way do I want to denigrate this great man's earlier works either - it just isn't my cup of tea, and I'm not a fan of most live music either unless it does something different and exciting.
  ""Ten New Songs"" is past Cohen's pure folk style where he started employing different elements, like synthesizers on ""I'm Your Man"" or bluesy like ""Popular People"".  The main difference for me is his voice.  As he grew older, his vocal performance took on an almost mystical quality - so deep, some half spoken, especially on ""Dear Heather"" or his last few albums, including the beautiful and my favorite album of his, ""You Want It Darker"", one of the saddest yet brilliant and catchy albums ever.
  ""Ten New Songs"" came after a nine year break, and according to amazon's review, he spent most of it in a monastery studying Zen teachings.  I'm not sure just how effective that isolation may have been but this album is the most languid and smooth of his latter works, and that's saying something coming from a man like him who defined mellow and cool in his music.  Sharon Robinson was a big part of this album, and played the lion's share of instruments and provided her own backing vocals.  She also wrote a lot of the music, with Cohen of course providing his usual genius lyrics and smoky voice.
  This album like no other Cohen CD is truly a captivating one as the style stays consistent with some of the most pensive and ethereal material he's done.  For those who are most attracted by his lyrics, they are included, but ""Ten New Songs"" are truly a set of tunes that fit together like a puzzle, with no pieces to be spared.  It isn't quirky, like ""Popular Problems"", a bit weird (but still great) like ""Dear Heather"", or synth heavy like ""I'm Your Man"".  It's another essential album from a genius who is and will continue to be a sorely missed presence in a music scene that desperately is crying out for the kind of quality he possessed.",1500249600,5

I often prefer to be doing something active, but when all sorts of craziness is going on, I like to nurture myself with music I love.  And it's been raining crazy over here for weeks, and today was no exception.  And our little man has been in the CD's of late, and let's just say things will never be the same with our collection and probably the sooner we go digital the better, so I bought myself this album as a treat for myself.  Because Heaven only knows where the CD is at this point.

So, I have loved Loreena Mckinnett for years, and this album is another one of my long standing favorites.  She has a beautiful, ethereal voice.  Her music is evocative and passionate and soothing all at the same time.  I love the infusion of poetry in her lyrics. I haven't heard a single thing of hers I haven't loved.  So no deep reasons for this rating, just I love what I love, and I really love this album.",1500249600,5

111365,9069,12547,"Dingmans music falls into the ECM school of jazz / not jazz improvisation.  The CDs opener, Tectonic Plates, starts very quietly, with subtle swells of vibraphone whose initial mallet strikes are masked behind a slowly-pressed volume pedal.  Voices of the Ancient follows, a seventeen-minute sandwich of pretty, but stuttering, full-band thematic statements wrapping a core of quiet guitar-and-vibes noodling.  A short, piano-and-sax Plea then climbs to The Pinnacles, another long suite repeating the structure of Tectonic Plates  six minutes of very quiet vibes-with-delay / piano figures trailed by fourteen minutes of jazz improv around subtly progressive constructs.  The disc closes with All Flows Forth, a long waltz that erupts at end with some free-form blowing, only to collapse into raindrop vibes under a mournful pianissimo piano.  Throughout the album, there is more texture than melody -- not necessarily a bad thing, considering that the melodies are often just simplistic unison lines of vibes, piano, and sax.  A little more harmonic structure, as well as assertiveness by Dingman himself, would have been welcome in this band-dominated set.  Whose line is it, anyway?",1500249600,3

I had no trekking poles with me, climbed up a very steep hill for about 1/4 mile and I made it back to my destination out breath after the short hike I did. Great test for me.

The lyrics and music are kind of a vintage classic rock with what sounds to be a blend of adult contemporary soft rock. Nontheless, this version of Because the Night by Patti Smith is perfect to listen to if you are an eclectic music listener andor are familiar with the Because the Night version by 10,000 Maniacs andor Cascada.",1500336000,5

111525,6735,2714,"Mark Knopfler is in fine form on this recording, which is full of songs crafted to be melodic and tell a story you'll want to hear told. Lots of ""trad"" sounding ballads on this one.

A lot like the old Dire Straits in places too, if that is what you are looking for. Some quiet rockers, understated for the most part, many ballads.as I said earlier. One or two more hard-moving numbers. A couple of bluesey songs.

Knopfler is at his mournful best on many of these songs, evoking the same vocal texture as on ""Private Investigations"" and ""Brothers in Arms"", which I consider his special strength as a singer. He has matured as a songwriter, but was always gifted in that department, able to spin fascinating lyrics on almost any subject. Here he is less cryptic than he has perhaps been (notably in places on Brothers in Arms and On Every Street).

His playing is, of course, virtuoso-level and he now has passed the need to show everyone that, making for understated brilliance. There's a particular joy in listening to someone who just knows how to play a given song for best overall effect (just as there's also a joy to hearing someone who gets paid by the note a-la Steve Howe or Django Reinhardt and someone who can take control and make you forget the other band components like Jimi Hendrix). It is a matter of mood for me.

In fact the ""feel"" of Privateering is very like Brothers in Arms (the album) for much of it, and I approve. I liked the Dire Straits sound and Knopfler evokes it here much of the time.

Personal Favorites:

The first track ""Redbud Tree"", a song in a minor key with a singable refrain, about a man on the run, ""Privateering"", a delightful call to all who would go adventuring on the Spanish Main,  and ""Corned Beef City"", a rocker telling the story of a trucker just squeaking by on one-day jobs.

But this album is one of those rare birds - one which has no ""clunkers"" for me. Picking favorites from such a collection is very hard.",1500336000,5

111538,898,13918,"The song Lets Dance by David Bowie has some phenomenal singing and combines both classic rock and 80s vintage pop elements. Lets Dance seems to have both a scandalous and a playful side to the song, musical story speaking, because Lets Dance also seems to be about sneaking away to be with someone in private away from prying eyes. However, I admit that I find Lets Dance to be enjoyable to listen to.",1500336000,5

Roger Daltrey's  vocals are shown off at their best in this song which was actually written by Pete Townsend. It reached 76 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was one of those songs that was better than its ranking on Billboard. Lyrically, it is the song of a desperate man at the end of his rope with the rain bringing special meaning that saves his life.

111789,11266,14663,"I'll give my overall thoughts first: This album is the follow-up to their self-titled release. Which I don't like as much as I used to. And this time around we have... Auto-tune and Pop rock to a T. But, Martin actually makes this sound work.
Track-by-Track thoughts:
1. Heart Heart Heartbreak (7/10) - The opening track, and lead single for the album. A very unique Power pop song that's essentially Martin telling a woman that this girl he was with is a liar and deceitful one at that, because she says things and negates them, and she puts her defenses up when it comes to a real problem in their relationship. This one's okay. I'm not crazy about it. I can listen to it more than once, but I'll ultimately forget it the following day, because it's not catchy enough.
2. Love Drunk (7/10) - Probably their most popular song, besides The Great Escape, this anthem has BLG fans going crazy. I wasn't too crazy, however. It's not because it's your cookie-cutter bland Pop punk, but rather the lyrics. I don't mind analogies in songs, but I do mind ones that are poorly written. Also, when I saw Ashley Tisdale in the music video, I just laughed continuously. But I realized that they were dating at the time, which made me laugh harder. Because... really? It's a little repetitive, but I could overlook that if it were catchy enough. Which it isn't.
3. She's Got a Boyfriend Now (4/10) - Probably one of the most cringe-worthy songs on the album, I found myself confused when I first listened to this one. I wasn't sure what I was exactly listening to, but once I figured it out, I was over it. The lyrics are something you'd find in just about any mainstream Pop artist's discography. The music is on the borderline of Pop-rock-Country. Which should've been a red flag for Crazy World...
4. Two is Better Than One (featuring Taylor Swiffer) (2/10) - Yes, I called Miss Swift ""Taylor Swiffer"", and if you didn't watch that MAD episode on Cartoon Network all those years back, then you have no idea what I'm talking about. But I digress. This song isn't bad because it sounds like a Country love ballad, nor is it because Tay Tay's on it, (although that doesn't help), but because it's just so bloody boring. It's one of the most banal things I've ever heard. I think I actually fell asleep when this track came on. And when I was watching TV, and noticed that an old Baskin' Robbins commercial had this song in it, I drifted away, and let my mind wander to different places. Two is not better than one. Well, unless we're talking about Baskin' Robbins ice cream. 'Cause... yeah. It's that good. But anyways, this song was just... no. No thank you.
5. Contagious (5/10) - I don't really have much to say about this song other than the title is ironic, and it's not really all that contagious as far as catchy.
6. Real Thing (4 I guess/10) - Meh...
7. Someone Like You (5/10) - I didn't really like this song, but I liked that Martin wrote it himself. He CAN write songs, and I'll tell you about it in a minute, but for me, this just felt like your average BLG filler track. *cough* Me, You, and My Medication.
8. The Shot Heard 'Round the World (10/10) - Quite honestly both my favorite BLG track and favorite track on this album. Where do I begin? Dark lyrics with interesting Power pop guitar riffs? Check. Maniacal laugh similar to Bat Country by Avenged Sevenfold, but instead, followed by the sound of a gunshot? Check. Heavier guitar riff before aforementioned laugh to give a brief breakdown that emulates Avenged Sevenfold or any Metal band really? Double check. What's not to love about hearing Martin singing about the fact that miracles don't exist, that there's no escape from the end of the world, and wanting to commit suicide as a last resort? I'll tell you what. Nothing. Nothing.
9. The First One (4/10) - A boring track that I can't really remember...
10. Chemicals Collide (7/10) - I kinda liked this track, and I felt that the lyrics were a big step up from Love Drunk and She's Got a Boyfriend Now, but again, not enough entirely to be unique enough.
11. Go (8/10) - Surprisingly enough, this is the only BLG song I can think of that hits the six minute mark. If you know others, please feel free to tell me. But I don't know if there are any other tracks that are this long. This one was okay enough to play a couple times, but it's no track 8, I'll tell you that much.
Final thought: Their best work will still always be their self-titled album, but this one slowly creeps up to being second best. In fact, it is second best, because Crazy World... *does not compute*",1500595200,3

111806,17420,11358,"1971 was a very interesting time in the Beach Boys career. The counterculture that an album like ""Pet Sounds"" and ""Smiley Smile"" helped usher in was still very much alive (and would be peaking until the end of 1972ish) but the Beach Boys were only really commercially viable in Europe and especially England were their newer materially was appreciated. Their previous album ""Sunflower"" was a critical success and mostly a fantastic album but debuted at something like #190 on the US charts (still kind of shocks me). They needed Brian's name to make a push for US interest but at the same time Brian, while still musically active was the Brian of old - his ear wasn't tuned to the charts and whatever he produced was most likely going to be highly un- commercial. This point is really the crux of the issue. The Boys and especially Mike Love want Brian, but only a certain type of Brian..ie..Don't get to weird! In 1971, I think their best bet was to tell Brian; ""Brian do what you want, anything! we are behind you a 100%!"" and then market it as Brian unchained. Well that's sort of what happened, but it was fighting all along the way. ""A Day in the Life of a Tree"", ""Till I Die"" and ""Surf's Up"" are a very dark and emotially challenging music for a band that less than a decade ago was singing great songs about fun in the sun. ""A Day in the life of a Tree"" is about exacly what the title says, although one could be tempted to think it was also about Brian's state of mind at the time. Wonderfully sung by at the time manager Jack Riley (with Van Dyke Parks of Smile fan in lead background vocals towards the end) its a great song and seagues perfectally into the more famous ""Till I Die"". Carl decided to finish ""Surf's Up"" which at the time was a stroke of critical and commercial genius as calling the album ""Surf's Up"" after the famed ""Smile"" song was likely the reason why this album got into the top 30 on the US charts. It's interesting hearing this version with Carl singing lead for the first half, up to ""Dove nested towers"", when the 1966/67 Brian takes over. Now we have a complete version with Brian on lead vocals from 2011's ""The Smile Sessions"" so its lessens the impact of the version here somewhat (although it's in stereo which adds something) but I try to think of how amazing it must have sounded when the album first came out. The ""Child is the Father of the Man"" contrapuntal choral at the end is one of the all time best Beach Boy moments. It's interesting the gave Alan Jardine the lead line during the choral and he does a fantastic job of singing; ""A Children's Song..."" Which brings me to Alan Jardine's input on the album. Alan has often been in the background with the Beach Boys, simply adding to their vocal blend and some rhythm guitar/misc. instruments here and there. For their last album ""Sunflower"", Alan was hardly given any spotlight. Here he sings a funky lead vocal line on ""Don't Go Near the Water"", most of ""Take a Load Off Your Feet"", ""Looking at Tomorrow (A Welfare Song) and the aforementioned climax of ""Surf's Up"". It's quite a big step up in prescense on this album for Alan. ""Looking at Tomorrow"" in particular I find seagues perfectly between ""Feel Flows"" and ""Day in the Life of a Tree"". It's a fantastic deeply psychedelic folk song with amazing phasing/flanging all over the track. Bruce Johnston bings the amazing ""Disney Girls"" which, no matter how annoying Bruce has been over the years, or how random/pointless/dorky he seems later on, he brought this song, which is just beautiful. Carl's ""Long Promised Road"" and ""Feel Flows"" are Carl breaking out as a fanastic song write. ""Feel Flows"" with it's mystic jazz flute/guitar/sax soloing is a favorite of mine. Up to this point of the review this album is largey perfect. Sure ""Take a Load Off Your Feet"" is bizarre, and a little unsettling but there's a lot to like about the track including Brian's lead vocals starting off the song (an increasing rarity at this point) and the violin at the end. Dennis's absence on this album really takes the album down. After 4 songwriting credits on ""Sunflower"", he really became a presence on a Beach Boys album, which he had been forahwile for varying degrees at this point. When you hear ""Wouldn't it be Nice to Live Again"" from the ""Surf's Up"" sessions, I wonder ""how in the HELL was this not put on the album!!?"" it would have easily been a highlight. The album is on 34 minutes and could have used it to pad out the run time. It wasn't completed from what I've read, but listening to it on ""Made in California"" box set, I think its easily finished enough to be on the album. O yea, ""Student Demonstration Time"" which is probably Mike Love's first true WTF moment (there would be many). It's a rewrite of  ""Riot in Cell Block 9"" with new lryics from Mike Love. Mike Love's biggest moment on ""Sunflower"" was the amazing proto dream pop ""All I Wanna Do"", and on this album he really doesn't follow that mid album showcase all that well. The song was performed well enough with enough bluesy umph to make it likeable enouh has an akward lryric refrain and really sounds entirely out of place on this album or any Beach Boys album. If Dennis's had a couple songs in place or in addition to that one it would have helped. Still a legendary abum that's easy to listen to all the way through over and over again. I recommend buying the mp3 ""Wouldn't it be Nice to Live Again"" from the ""Made in California"" box set to complete the album better or to replace ""Student Demonstration Time"" depending on how you feel about the track.",1500595200,4

111809,18270,19724,"Georg Philipp Telemann (1681-1767) was one of the foremost German composers of the late Baroque period. A friend of both Johann Sebastian Bach and Georg Frederic Handel, Telemann is known to have composed over 3,000 musical works over his long lifetime, although many of them have been lost.  Those works include concertos, sacred cantatas, overture suites, passions, oratorios, operas, and his lengthy oeuvre of light instrumental works known collectively as Tafelmusik, or Table Music.

Telemann: Tafelmusik is a 4-compact disc (CD) collectors edition that gathers all known Telemann Tafelmusik compositions into one box set. The set contains 70 tracks and almost 5 hours of music. Musica Antiqua K&ouml;ln (MAK) a now disbanded chamber orchestra that specialized in 17th and 18th century music and was led by Reinhard Goebel, performs the music, which is simply a delightful listening experience from beginning to end. Originally composed by Telemann for use at banquets and feasts, Tafelmusik is light, airy, and unfailingly upbeat. MAK and Goebels performances set just the right mood, and the audio quality from Deutsche Grammophon / Archiv Produktion is warm, spacious, and deliciously crisp and clear.

Lately I have been playing Tafelmusik a lot whenever I am working in my home office. It is ideal for background music, and I find it both relaxing and cheerful.  It has very quickly become one of my favorites from the Baroque period. Most highly recommended.",1500595200,5

The first objection is the title. When I have to pause to figure out how to pronounce the thing, it makes me feel stupid (and, I suspect, the majority of other listeners). Maybe I should just grab a dictionary or something

Beyond that, the songs just didn't work for me. Just not as catchy as his past work. The only ones that I found keepers were Acquaintance, Summer Mourning and Half a Room, (although Photograph is pretty good, I will admit). Overall?

111983,6894,20537,"Yes Virginia, there is a retributive force in nature. Vengeance is mine! sayeth the Lord God. I will re-pay them! On this point the fate of Glenn Gould is salutary. Dead he aint. Rather, God turned him into a werewolf in 1982 as punishment for vandalising Mozarts sonatas. Nowadays he appears as Lycan in those dreadful Underworld movies with Kate Beckinsale  and does so without make-up. Such be the gravity of his offence, Ive often wondered why the Big Fella has not replicated the KT Extinction Event or the Great Dying of Permian times as vengeance. The advent of this Denon box  Haeblers second survey of the canon  is reassurance: a bulwark in place. A Mighty Fortress is our Ingrid!

God did not put Haebler on earth to brawl with Conor McGregor in a cage-match. Nor did He expect her to trap Big Foot, locate Amelia Earhart, fight alongside Colonel Sanders at Khe Sanh, bring Kung Fu Hill-Billy to heel on the Jerry Springer Show or be the human-mattress in Nude for Satan (Italy, 1974). No, no, no  all He wanted her to do is play Mozart and Haydn. Not Beethoven, not Schubert, not Liszt and certainly not Scriabin  just Mozart and Haydn. This Denon cycle from the late Eighties is as magical as her Philips outing from the late Sixties  and its recorded in better sound. With the exception of the outer movements of K 310 and K 457  they're somewhat genteel  everything heres in the Goldilocks Zone. It sings, it shines, it glows! Theres not a bead of sweat on a single bar. When played like this, K 331 ranks with any other sonata in existence (which is hardly surprising given how wrong Kchel 1 was in its chronology). Much the same could be said of K 332  in its lightness of being and profundity, it is symbol inconsumable. Will we ever understand what it means - or does wisdom lie in surrender and abandonment to its coruscations? I advocate the latter. One of the highlights of the earlier cycle was the slow movement of K 545. Here, the feat is replicated. To be haunted by Real Presence.

Pellucid and melodious, subtle and immensely satisfying, this cycle is the Word  just as its predecessor was too. Come to it, in radiance and grace!",1500940800,5

111992,18381,16529,"There's much more variety and depth to this soundtrack, a more ""dramatic"" sound for some of the most dramatic characters in the series.

Featuring the nearly-emotionless Mr. Freeze's icy vengeance, the majestic thief catwoman, the dictatorial terrorist Red Claw, the creeper Scarecrow, and the nostalgic old school heroic persona of the Gray Ghost.  Even the bonus tracks carry their own weight, either adding to these personas or creating a hypnotizing sound all on their own.

Even if you've never seen the show or these specific episodes, you'll surely be moved in Some way by the sheer variety.  Additionally, each music composed for each episode doesn't have the same basic melody repeated in each track with a slightly different arrangement (as other Batman albums have done).  Instead, they keep the basic theme of the character and/or episode in mind, and each track is composed in a way where you'll feel several different emotions during the course of the track.

Some great examples are ""Alley Cat/Catwoman Strikes"" and ""The Iceman Cometh Again.""  There are quiet, contemplating moments, but also parts where you feel like danger is coming and you're rushing to escape.  Even the action-packed tracks like ""Bruce Wayne's Chaperone/A Bumpy Ride"" and the ""Gray Ghost Suite"" don't just maintain the same rhythm and sound throughout their playtime--the sound can be suddenly brazen or quiet, or suddenly slow down or speed up, but all in a natural, unforced way that'll draw you in.",1500940800,5

112049,8867,18519,"I had avoided this recording for years until I found a copy in the clearance bin of my local used CD store ($1.99 for the Flower of Western Culture). For context, I have copies of Beecham (LP), Christie, Davis, Hogwood, Jochum, Krips (EMI), Mackerras, the ancient Moralt (WWII vintage with Schwarzkopf), and Wallberg (also with Gruberova) recordings. I find this Solti so-so. First, despite strong skills in florid singing, there is something in Gruberova's style that irritates me - an approach to notes that is sometimes ever so slightly under pitch that is evident here, in her two recordings of Zerbinetta, Beatrice di Tenda, and her Lucia (EMI). Second, Battle muffs the high E in her first aria. It should really have been redone. Winbergh is fine without effacing memories of Fritz Wunderlich. Zednik's serenade is fine but he can't maintain even tone in ""Frisch zum kampfe"" on the high notes. Talvela's Osmin is OK without sounding either truly dangerous or roguish. Solti's conducting is brisk and efficient and the Vienna forces play and sing well.

If forced to choose only one recording, I'd have to opt for Jochum and the much mourned Wunderlich despite Koth's shrill Kostanze.",1501027200,3

112078,18270,9219,"I recently discovered Virtual Box Set  Complete Beethoven Piano Sonatas while browsing through the digital music section at Amazon.com. When I saw this MP3 albums amazingly low price of $6.99 for the entire collection of 32 Beethoven piano sonatas, I immediately purchased it. I am very glad I did.

Jen Jand&oacute; is a Hungarian concert pianist who has recorded for the Naxos classical music label for over twenty years. He is the featured soloist on Virtual Box Set  Complete Beethoven Piano Sonatas, and his performances of these masterworks are uniformly excellent. Jand&oacute; plays in a highly polished, artistic, and yet straightforward manner that conveys Beethovens full range of emotions very effectively, but without any unnecessary musical flourishes. He is very easy and enjoyable to listen to. I don't think he is in quite the same exalted company as elite concert pianists like Murray Perahia, Vladimir Ashkenazy, or Martha Argerich, (to name but a few), but Jand&oacute; acquits himself very well indeed in each note of every Beethoven piano sonata he plays.

I think Virtual Box Set  Complete Beethoven Piano Sonatas by Jen Jand&oacute; is an excellent way to acquire a complete cycle of Beethoven's piano sonatas at a very affordable price. While perhaps not the very top choice for these works, it is certainly a clear winner, and one of my new favorites. Highly recommended. (4 Stars ^ 5)",1501113600,5

112084,488,11365,"Where do I begin?
First off, I really, really, really wanted to like this album. After reading the stories and reviews I figured this was right up my alley. As a lover of all things pop and bubblegum, I thought this would be on an equal plane of the best Ohio Express, 1910 Fruitgum Co, Association, Archies, Patridge Family all rolled into one.
Alas, it is not to be.
There is nothing memorable here, nothing that will leave you humming the rest of the day. No hit singles to speak of. I've heard this was one of the most expensive albums made at the time. I think they tried and tried and tinkered over and over to perfect the sound and come up with a hit to no avail. The sound is fine, I have it on 180 gram vinyl. It's just the songs. They just sit there, with all their little background noises.
The only song I actually like is I'm With You. It sounds like the aforementioned Association crossed with The Partridge Family.
I've tried playing it over and over but nothing sticks. Not the song titles and not the cold, sterile tunes themselves.
It sounds bright and sunny but is hollow and empty beneath.",1501113600,2

112128,10506,4986,"At least before his arrest, Phil Spector was hailed a musical genius. True, he did produce several classic singles for the Ronettes, Crystals and Righteous Brothers that are some of the most beloved Oldies from the 60s, but he was not on par with someone like Paul McCartney or John Lennon who could craft entire concept albums that remain classics 50-plus years later.

I am not bashing Phil nor his music, just using my above statement to back up my two-star review for this CD that is only worth getting for HES A REBEL, DA DOO RON RON and THEN HE KISSED ME. The other songs on here are nowhere near as good as the three hits. Its too bad that the Crystals didn't have better material, but I feel a little of Phils sound went a long wayit only worked with the right melodies and lyrics, and the rest of whats here is lacking. I fell in love with the Crystals hits back in the early 80s and actually liked them better than the Shirelles or the Chiffons back then. But Ive heard a few of the Shirelles albums recorded in the 60s and even the deep album cuts are much better than the second-string hits found here by The Crystals. The sound quality on this CD isn't the best either. Sorry, cant recommend this.",1501200000,2

112172,18270,7460,"I stumbled upon ""100 Must-Have Bach Masterpieces"" while browsing the digital music section at Amazon.com. I was a bit surprised to see that this MP3 album's track listing on its Amazon web page does not show the performing artists' names on well over half the listed tracks, and the few names that are shown I have never heard of before. I thought it best to give this album a ""try-before-I-buy"" listen before committing even a couple of bucks to its purchase. I am glad I did.

This may be the worst compilation of music by Johann Sebastian Bach I have ever heard. The 100 tracks selected for this album are alright, although they only cover 25 different Bach compositions and therefore don't give a particularly well-rounded picture of the immense depth and breadth of Bach's incredible genius. The biggest problem, however, is the dated musicianship on the album.

Every one of the selections is played too slowly, and every performance is flat, lifeless, and dull. Allegro (quick) movements, especially in the Brandenburg Concerto, Orchestral Suite, piano concerto, and violin concerto selections, are played at a nearly Andante (moderately slow) pace, and Andante movements are played at close to a Largo (very slow) tempo.  Choral pieces fare no better. Choruses and solo vocalists, while technically competent, sing with little of the artistry  found in the best Bach recordings. I found the selections from both the ""St. Matthew Passion"" and St. John Passion"" especially lethargic and monotonous.

There are far better compilations of Bach's music that are performed by world-class musicians who infuse their performances with energy, passion, and tremendous artistry. Two such particularly praiseworthy albums are&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Essential-Bach-2CDs/dp/B000W0B1CO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Essential Bach (2CDs)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/50-x-Bach/dp/B00P3CEUXS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">50 x Bach</a>, both of which are highly enjoyable and very affordable.

Bottom line: ""100 Must-Have Bach Masterpieces"" is a non-starter at any price. Not recommended.",1501200000,1

112203,17601,16119,"Joe Jackson wasn't the first artist to record new material in front of a live audience, but he may hold the distinction of the first artist to tell the audience to shut their mouths and hold their applause during the session. Attending that ascetic 1986 concert, which became the ""Big World"" album, must have felt like an exercise in both extreme stoicism and maniacal Zen, or perhaps in self-imposed exhilaration constipation. Here's some incredible music played by a great band, but please don't make any noise or show any auditory appreciation of any kind. Hoot and holler in your minds only, please. The entire concept negates everything that ""shout, wriggle and clap"" pop music has built itself upon. Given the awesome set list, fans must have had a hard time keeping it all in. Apparently they had no problem, so gold stars for everyone. Back in 1979, Neil Young had recorded new material live for ""Rust Never Sleeps,"" but with the crowd noise filtered out. Interestingly, that album, though very different musically, has a similar vibe and feel to ""Big World."" The distinctive reverb of a concert hall lingers before and after each song. Not to mention the mood feels more electric than music recorded in cozy rooms lined with sound baffling. In Jackson's case, all of that suppressed applause and enthusiasm probably heightened the tension to breaking point. No one filtered it out, it was just collectively swallowed. Happily, the approach worked and ""Big World"" sits comfortably among Jackson's best work, though the album disappointingly didn't sprout any hits or massive chart rankings. Perhaps this album and the relative silence appropriated to its equally ambitious follow-up, ""Blaze of Glory,"" prompted Jackson to later abandon the pop scene for nearly a decade.

""Big World,"" as an album, succeeds in creating a world of its own. A veritable salad of musical styles, it reflects the actual culturally complicated amalgam referred to in its title. Some critics at the time lambasted it as ""eclectic"" and ""messy."" Did they not see the album's title? Or perhaps they hadn't traveled far from their land of origin? Western pop music, particularly from America, has always carried a dose of myopia and xenophobia with it, arguably a slight reflection of its cultural context, and this may account for some of the less than stellar reviews at the time. The album does contain a vast array of styles, everything from Joe Jackson Band-esque rock to jazz to world fusion to gorgeous ballads. It is eclectic, highly eclectic, but that's a really good thing. Thankfully, its reputation seems to have gradually increased with time and perhaps with new musical attitudes. The 1980s might represent Jackson's peak, especially for pop music, and ""Big World"" site almost exactly between the excellent ""Night and Day"" and the amazing ""Blaze of Glory"" and right after the brass-infused ""Body and Soul."" All of these albums still sound great today. ""Big World,"" for some reason, seems to remain the most obscure, and possibly the most neglected, of the group.

""Wild West"" initiates listeners into this new realm via a slow fade-in. Western-style whistling melds with jangly guitar and soon with throttled, driving rock. It encompasses both the brashness of expansionism on the American continent and fervent entitlement. After all, ""you've got a right just to get where you're going to."" Of course guns appear and ""you wonder if this is the way the west is won."" Anxiety, brutal competition and uncertainty reign ""'cause a dog eats a dog then he eats his master too."" A fitting portrait and a great opener. ""Right and Wrong,"" one of those rare pop songs that dares to take on morality, seems to summon America's often black and white view of the world and appeal to populism. Don't use ""big words."" Cartoons and simplifications work just fine, thank you. The big world gets a little filtered out, or outright ignored, here. ""(It's A)Big World"" displays some of the album's most adventurous and non-western melodies as it soars around the globe sampling niceties and delicacies. Perhaps this serves as another portrayal of superficial views of other cultures? The lyrics seem to evoke a tourist's or thrill-seeker's view of the world or someone searching for fantasies on distant shores. Its litany of needless luxuries ends with the intriguing line ""question all you believe in."" The narrator of ""Precious Time,"" one of modern society's most scarce commodities, exudes isolation, endless work cycles and a tragic yearning for true companionship while ""strung out from never asking why, we burn with blind ambition."" In the end ""just a smile's enough, just some of that human stuff."" ""Tonight and Forever"" continues the hard rocking modern alienation as the lyrics express intense desire while pondering about its mysterious origins or if the object of desire is even likeable. ""Shanghai Sky"" presents one of the album's most beautiful moments. Lilting arpeggios underlie a delicate piano melody. It feels like a slow sunrise or a glance over a gently windblown meadow. The lyrics reflect an initial world weariness, but despite an entirely inhabited world, discoveries still remain.

""Fifty Dollar Love Affair,"" somewhat self-explanatory, follows a shore-leave sailor shuffling along a harbor town. Brash masculinity seeps from every line. Some may choose to drown cultural alienation in pleasures, despite how others may interpret these actions. ""We Can't Live Together"" presents a familiar struggle between brute passion and abject incompatibility. ""Forty Years"" may qualify as one of Jackson's best songs. Summoning up poignant World War II alliances, few would deny the song's relevance to ever more complicated twenty-first century politics. Those giants seem to roam again. Those rivers may run red yet again. Once allies danced and sang. It ominously suggests that old deeply violent tensions may have unearthed yet again. Humans have always had trouble learning from the past. Jackson plays and sings this soaring number masterfully on solo piano until a guitar appears and takes over the main melody at the very end. The almost punk rock guitar-driven ""Survival"" revisits anxiety about the future and exhorts listeners to ""take what you want but just what you need for survival."" ""Soul Kiss"" sways and yearns for something of substance in a world of empty glitter and crass hedonism. Not only that, it deals with the frustration of being a person looking for something substantial in such a world. Anyone who doesn't get ""The Jet Set"" probably belongs to part of its targeted population. Here frenzied, monolingual tourists go from site to site without letting anything, or anyone, get in the way. ""Tango Atlantico,"" actually a tango, another rarity in pop music, seems to return to World War II but possibly from an American perspective. The ""Tango Atlantico"" probably refers to journeys from the US to England for war. After all, the US entered both of the twentieth-century's major wars after they had erupted, or arguably, ""a little too late."" Jackson released ""Home Town"" as a single but it sadly the catchy number didn't garner much interest. It tells the story of a person trying to relocate his home town after years of avoidance migrating. Of course few can really ever return after numerous years have intervened. The anthemic ""Man in the Street,"" the only song released from rehearsals and not from the actual concert, creates a sympathetic view of the ""everyman."" Self-assured yet self-effacing, perhaps there's more going on with such people than their supposed ""social superiors"" think. It directly challenges people to rethink assumptions: ""So how do you know that the man in the street don't know. And why don't you care, when the man in the street don't know.""

The title ""Big World"" actually ties the individual songs together rather nicely. A statement on diversity, myopia, conflict and alienation, it stands as yet one more Joe Jackson masterpiece from his very productive 1980s work. The original front and back covers featured the words ""Big World"" in nearly thirty languages, which almost pleads with people to look outside their own insulated worldviews and recognize everything that surrounds them. The hurried cartoon businessman, slightly resembling Jackson, and zooming jet add to the effect and suggest the album's thematic demographic. A largely underappreciated album, originally released on three-sided LP and single CD, its themes and music still speak to today's overly busy and harried lives and immanently burgeoning global conflict. Humanity may not survive the coming century. Or maybe it will. But if it doesn't, people such as those depicted on ""Big World"" will probably be too distracted or too overstimulated to notice. At least artists such as Jackson provided some real substance, and arguably a warning, along the way.",1501286400,5

112208,2248,5164,"This song was extremely big in the late 80s, early 90s. It's simple, but its synth beats and ""yodeling"" chorus is instantly recognizable to anyone who was mentally cognizant at the time (it was in a Listerine commercial and an ad for one of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle movies, notably). The composition really feels fun and yet heroic at the same time, making you think that it's deeper than it is. It's a shame that Baltimora died before he ever topped it, and even more of a shame that there are no really good covers of this song to carry on the legacy, but that's neither here nor there: If you want something a little cheesy and a lot of fun to dance to, pick up Tarzan Boy!",1501286400,5
112209,18404,5295,"One of my favorite, fun, up-beat, family-friendly songs of the 80's.

The 1980's, in general, produced a lot of songs that dealt with a lot of emotion and dark topics when it came to music- especially in the evolution of the genres electronic, wave, pop, in their infancy.  Many artists in the 80's sang about love/sex, heart-ache and heartbreak, and love lost.  Not too many artists had positive songs about dancing in genera- in a light-hearted way that Men Without Hats did for The Safety Dance.

There's no sexual undertones about one-night stands, obsession, or revenge/regret.  Just plain 'ole dancing and joking about it!

It combines the aggression of Iowa, the melody of Vol. 3 and the complexity of All Hope is Gone. While there is no bad Slipknot album, I would say this is their second best right behind Iowa.

112420,1402,20205,"A musician I once jammed with wrote and arranged his material using the early MIDI sequencing technology, consisting of a personal computer and various synthesizers and drum machines. Sometimes he would do actual smaller-venue gigs with that setup. He would select one guitar or one keyboard to play manually. It was similar to the way Tangerine Dream often operate their array of gear on tour. Whatever you do, don't come to this later of two Orchestrion albums (the earlier single-disc 2011 release is simply titled ""Orchestrion"" and has some of the same material) expecting any major ""bending of the genre"". This is Pat Metheny music, pure and simple. The same stuff we've always expected of him on albums like ""Still Life Talking"" and ""Secret Story"". Only we don't get Lyle Mays & co on this, Pat does it all himself. The only flaw I can see there is that it isn't as strong rhythmically as his Pat Metheny Group releases because there isn't a rhythm section. Which works okay with some of his material, but not all.",1501632000,4

112459,8327,9927,"While Randy Newman is a musical household name in 2017 - especially with his glorious Oscar-winning Soundtrack work on beloved Pixar films like ""Toy Story"", ""Monsters Inc."" and more - back in 1972 when he was onto his 4th solo LP for Reprise Records (3rd studio set) - and despite huge industry wide critical acclaim - he couldn't get arrested by the buying public even if he did insult short people or rail against the tyranny of religious zealots.

Originally released in May 1972 - the American vinyl LP of Reprise MS 2064 was not only ignored but even derided in some sectors - something Newman alludes to and smirks at in the caustic liner notes that accompany this stunning 2002 Rhino CD reissue. Because of course history tells us a different story to the chart indifference he suffered then - ""Sail Away"" is a great album - a masterpiece really - and an early jewel in a very large and long career arc. He is also helped by an impressive array of session players - Ry Cooder, Chris Etheridge of The Flying Burrito Brothers, Jimmy Bond, Wilton Felder of The Crusaders and Milt Holland to name but a few (Randy plays piano and sings). It's lonely at the top indeed. Here are the memos from Simon Smith and his Amazing Dancing Bear...

UK released May 2002 - ""Sail Away"" by RANDY NEWMAN on Rhino/Reprise 8122-78244-2 (Barcode 081227824426) is an 'Expanded Edition' CD Remaster of the 12-Track 1972 LP with Five Previously Unreleased Bonus Tracks and plays out as follows (41:51 minutes):

1. Sail Away [Side 1]
2. Lonely At The Top
3. He Gives Us All His Love
4. Last Night I Had A Dream
5. Simon Smith And The Amazing Dancing Bear
6. Old Man
7. Political Science [Side 2]
8. Burn On
9. Memo To My Son
10. Dayton, Ohio - 1903
11. You Can Leave Your Hat On
12. God's Song (That's Why I Love Mankind)
Tracks 1 to 12 are his 4th album ""Sail Away"" (3rd studio set) - released May 1972 in the USA on Reprise MS 2064 and July 1972 in the UK on Reprise K 44185.

BONUS TRACKS (Previously Unreleased):
13. Let It Shine
14. Maybe I'm Doing It Wrong (Studio Version)
15. Dayton, Ohio - 1903 (Early Version)
16. You Can Leave Your Hat On (Demo)
17. Sail Away (Early Version)

The 20-page booklet is a pleasingly in-depth affair with a Page 3 introduction from the great songsmith himself and a further essay/assessment pleasantly called ""Of Freaks, Geeks, And God"" by Editor of the Rolling Stone  DAVID WILD. There is even some personalized notes on the five Previously Unreleased outtakes and how pleased Randy is with the sound of the new Remaster carried out by long-time Rhino Records Audio Engineer associate - DAN HERSCH. This is a gorgeous sounding CD reissue - warm and full - as this quietly subdued album has always cried out for.

""...In America you get food to eat...Won't have to run through the jungle and scuff up your feet...You'll just sing about Jesus and drink wine all day..."" You can't really imagine (even now) the impact those opening lyrics to ""Sail Away"". Firstly very few artists would have risked them. Newman isn't casually slagging off America or taking a cheap shot - but he is highlighting hypocrisies and attacking homegrown racists and their simplistic crap all in the same song. The fact that he does all this inside a haunting melody (orchestration conducted by Louis Kauffman) is all the more remarkable. Newman then digs at his own supposed Rock Star lifestyle in ""Lonely At The Top"" - the applause - the money  the after parties. The song was used as a title to a CD Best Of for Warner Brothers in 1987 remastered by Lee Herschberg  a disc I bought back in early days of reissue.

An uncaring God and our blind allegiance to pie-in-the-sky indoctrination crops up in the sly and disturbing ""He Gives Us All His Love"". The distinctive rattle of Ry Cooder's slide guitar strings comes slinking in on ""Last Night I Had A Dream""  a song I only half like actually. Speaking of which - his Alan Price hit ""Simon Smith And The Amazing Dancing Bear"" dates back to the Sixties and put RN on the songwriting map. But again - I've always admired the song more than I actually liked it. ""Old Man"" is one of the saddest melodies on the album - a tearful farewell by a son to his father - a Dad he clearly dislikes and loves in equal measure.

Side 2 gives us the masterful ""Political Science"" - a song with lyrics that inspire awe and giggles even now  a full 45 years after they were released. The protagonist singer tells of American Generals and Politicians weary of trying to be nice to the world  why bother man - they hate all Americans anyhow. So to Hell with them all and let's drop the big one now (not on Australia though - don't want to hurt no Kangaroo - besides they've got surfing and good weather too). ""Burn On"" is one of the album's secret nuggets - a river in Cleveland suddenly containing magical qualities as a red moon of fire rises in the distance. Understated observation number 424 comes in the shape of ""Memo To My Son"" - as witty and as wise a love letter from a father to a son as you'll ever hear. Like most young Dads - he's struggling with all the joys and terrors a child brings - but there's a simple love in there that's so touching. In the liner notes Newman's fairly dismissive of ""Dayton, Ohio - 1903"" but I actually think it's beautiful - a mournful 'missus and me' ballad. The ever so slightly perverse ""You Can Leave Your Hat On"" tickled many people's fancy (Tom Jones even covered it for ""The Full Monty"" film) - and it's easy to work out why as it plays - the song is witty, acidic and lusty. Buddhists and Hindus join Catholics and Jews on Satellite TV for the seriously harsh ""God's Song (That's Why I Love Mankind)""  a nonchalant even disinterested Almighty poo-pooing his creation Mankind as they beg for mercy from plagues and suffering.

You can't help thinking that the wonderful outtake ""Let It Shine"" was left off the album precisely because it is so upbeat and uplifting - not in keeping with the album's overall moody demeanor. But it's a treat to hear it and ""Maybe I'm Doing It Wrong"" - fully formed songs that actually deserve the moniker 'Bonus'. As I already liked ""Dayton, Ohio - 1903"" - a pretty 'early version' of it is alright by me. And the early version of the title song is radically different and fascinating for it...

""...I hope people like them this time..."" - Randy Newman remarks in the new liner notes (the next LP ""Good Ole Boys"" from 1974 was also reissued in this CD series) - maybe a little mellowed by the years and distance. I'd agree.

I know RN is not everyone's cup of Darjeeling - but his songmanship and affecting melodies/lyrics warrant your attention  yes even deserve it. And 1972's forgotten and overlooked ""Sail Away"" album is the perfect starting point...",1501718400,5

112624,2674,13993,"Okay, I may be preaching to the choir, but this is a fabulous set of live music!

Can I call Drive By Truckers the best band working in the USA today? Nominate anyone else you want to, but Im gonna declare DBT the winners anyway. Theyve been through several lineup shuffles over the past decade or so, but the band does indeed keep on truckin, thanks to the outstanding songs of Patterson Hood and Mike Cooley. and their unabashed love of playing music

This 3-CD set, culled from recent live shows, the band in top form. Factor in their deft musical chops (including some very impressive guitar playing), Hoods sometimes funny and often passionate between-song story-telling, and some fierce versions of many of their best-known songs, and you have a powerful live album. If you're a DBT fan, this is a must have. Life affirming music.",1501977600,5

112697,18270,7110,"Lately Ive had a great deal of success in finding large, outstanding compilations of classical music at the unbelievably low price of 99 cents. I recently acquired The Bach Guild's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Big-Haydn-Symphonies-Box/dp/B013THM8PA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Big Haydn Symphonies Box</a>&nbsp;from Amazon.com, and I liked it so much I decided to add another one of the Big Box albums to my digital music collection. This time I chose the Big Mozart Box. It turned out to be an inspired choice.

Big Mozart Box features nearly 14 hours of instrumental music by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, all for only 99 cents. This superlative MP3 album contains an extraordinarily impressive array of music from a variety of sub-genres within the oeuvre of Mozarts music. Mozart is known to have composed over 600 works across a large spectrum of sub-genres during his short lifetime. Over 40 of his instrumental works appear in their entirety in Big Mozart Box. They include divertimenti, serenades, symphonies, string quartets, piano sonatas, overtures, fantasies, concertos for a variety of solo instruments, and others. Each clearly shows the depth and breadth of Mozarts incredibly inventive musical genius.

These are all superb performances from the mid-20th century. They feature various world-class orchestras, conductors, chamber ensembles, and solo instrumentalists, all of whom demonstrate the highest degree of artistry and musicianship in every performance. They do a wonderful job of conveying the full emotional power and drama that Mozart infused into his music. Although these are mostly older stereophonic recordings (a few of them are monaural), the audio quality of the entire album is clean, crisp, and well-balanced.

Of all the Big Box albums I have acquired thus far, I think Big Mozart Box is clearly the best. I listen to it constantly, and I am always highly entertained by it. Most highly recommended.",1502150400,5

112711,1738,17783,"Going Back was originally released in 2010, with 18 songs on it, and 25 songs on the deluxe version. There were 4 more bonus tracks available on the DVD, which were downloadable, for a total of 29 songs. Phil thought that was too many songs, so for this 2016 remaster, he retitled the album ""The Essential Going Back"" and trimmed it down to 14 songs. This is a blunder in my view, no matter how he justifies it. Especially with 2 CDs to fill up. The other 15 songs could have (and should have) been somewhere on this collection, even if they were weaker than the 14 songs he chose to keep (which will be a matter of opinion to each listener). It's sort of like ""Coda"" by Led Zeppelin. The last album, and weakest one, but one you still need to complete your collection. The songs here aren't terrible, the production is great and if I could describe the performances in one word, it would be ""perfunctory.""",1502150400,3

You have a mixture of dance beats, rap lyrics, rock music and so forth so if your a true fan of the Undead then pick this CD up, like many have been saying sound too mainstream but like any singers composers got to mature and move on with their music like I said in a pervious review they lost the main singer and replace with Danny.  I personally enjoy all but one song and that's saying lot for a music CD and my taste in music.  In closing if you love blasting your car radio with bass, good rap lyrics, and mind numbing rock guitars riffs on certain songs then buy this album and see for yourself that Hollywood Undead are still impress their fans.",1502150400,4
112734,18270,12466,"Lately Ive been having a great deal of success in finding large compilations of classical music at unbelievably low prices. Ive been reading some uniformly glowing reviews of the Big Box albums from The Bach Guild, so I decided to purchase one to see if its as good as reviewers say it is.

My first choice was the Big Haydn Symphonies Box, featuring over nine hours of Franz Joseph Haydns symphonies, for only 99 cents. This MP3 album contains a quite impressive array of music from the composer known as the father of the modern symphony. Haydn composed 104 symphonies during his long lifetime, and 24 of them appear in their entirety in Big Haydn Symphonies Box. They range from his earlier light-hearted works, through his more impassioned Sturm und Drang middle symphonies, and on to his most famous later Paris and London symphonic masterpieces.

These are all very fine performances from the 1950s through the 1970s. They feature various world-class orchestras and conductors who seem to mostly hail from eastern Europe. These ensembles may not have been as renowned as many of their more famous western counterparts, but their artistry and musicianship are undeniably every bit as good. They consistently do a wonderful job of conveying the full emotional power and drama of Haydns great symphonic masterworks.

There are two unfortunate technical flaws in Big Haydn Symphonies Box that prevent me from awarding this otherwise outstanding album my full 5-star rating. There is a short but noticeable high-pitched tone at the 1:19 mark of track 13. Although its not particularly bothersome, the albums engineers should have noticed and removed it. Also, the final movement of Symphony No. 90 is incorrect. Although the tracks metadata correctly lists it as Finale: Allegro Assai, the music is actually a duplicate of the first movement of Symphony No. 91. Again, the albums engineers should have discovered and eliminated this error.

Despite these minor flaws, Big Haydn Symphonies Box is an excellent MP3 album that I enjoy listening to on a regular basis. Highly recommended.",1502150400,4

The return of the aggressive screaming showcasing Chester's unique voice is part of Linkin Park's appeal along with Mike's rapping, and the EDM flavor that the DJ produces.  It's a great album, one that makes up for A Thousand Suns.  One thing about Linkin Park is that they evolve from one album to another.  I recommend not comparing their latest albums with past albums and you will enjoy it.  Keep an open mind and listen to them a few times, there's many songs that will relate to you.",1502236800,5

But it is even sadder when that person who dies early is a legend that really has defined voice, spirit & a genre that has been unmistakable. Unfortunately, that was defined yesterday with the tragic death of Glenn Campbell. He had a lot of great songs that really defined country all the way back to the 2960's, when he worked with Elvis Presley & Frank Sinatra as a background musician. But when he went on his own, he scored so many amazing songs & won the hearts of millions from all genres. But his death from Alzheimer's is a reminder of how your tragic addictions, like Glen's battle with alcoholism can alter into other disorders & lead to death. One of Glen's biggest songs from the 70's, Southern Nights is one of those songs that really brought out his soulful twang, with enduring charm. I found the track to be dearly divine from start to finish. Glen had it all & sadly passed on from his demons & his disease that plagued his soul. But Glen Campbell with always be remembered forever young to his fans.

112767,56,1588,"Hard to believe that today really is Whitney Houston's birthday, and she would've been 54 years old. Musically, she is one of the greatest divas in the world, that has shown that true beauty is solely from the voice within. She showcased a amazing bravado at the heart of the matter. But overall, she died at a very young age. But if there is one thing that I have known about Whitney, is that unlike other divas of today, her voice really reached from the deepest inner soul, something that I still adore today, much more than today's divas like Rihanna or Beyonce' Knowles that are products, not people. It also is the 25th anniversary of The Bodyguard soundtrack, the biggest selling soundtrack in the world, that absolutely defined a era of the music, the 1990's. I absolutely adore all of the songs Whitney Houston performed on the soundtrack, and Run To You is absolutely no exception. The song is absolutely beautiful & soulful from Whitney's vocals, each time I hear the song. It truly is astonishing & beautiful. It really is that high of the top tier, as is the case with I Will Always Love You & any other ballad Whitney had recorded over the years. It truly is a lovely opus that is worth any listener's ear that really strikes the essence of beauty. This is one Whitney Houston song I sincerely recommend listening to.

I was fortunate enough to catch Monster Magnet on this very U.S. tour play a headlining gig at a club. Tunes that undoubtedly make this piece a keeper are the [total] ass-kicking  ""Unbroken (Hotel Baby)"", the power-house ""Radiation Day"", the Hawkwind / Robert Calvert-penned ""The Right Stuff"" (I remember half the crowd at their show didn't - even recognize this tune), the awesome Ken Baker-penned ""There's No Way Out Of Here"" (track initially shows up on David Gilmour's 1978 self-titled solo lp), the seven-minute ""Ultimate Everything"" and ""CNN War Thing"". Plus, there are two bonus tracks tagged on for good measure the rocking ""King Of Mars 2004"" and a third cover tune - Lou Reed's ""Venus In Furs"". Well worth checking out.",1502323200,4

112950,18478,12466,"From about 2004 -- 2006, I had a project of hearing and reviewing Haydn's 104 numbered symphonies here on Amazon, mostly in CDs with three symphonies each. These days are gone and CDs are mostly gone. Haydn's symphonies remain alive, and I enjoyed revisiting many of them in this big box set. The medium has changed as well from CDs to a delivery of these works on MP3 to my Kindle. This big box is part of a series released by Vanguard Records or its successors from the large vault of classical music Vanguard recorded from the late 1940s through the 1960s. At $0.99, this box is a bargain.

Only a handful of Haydn's symphonies are performed regularly in concert halls, but recorded music has made the entire set of 104 available. This box includes 25 of the symphonies composed throughout Haydn's career. The box begins with symphony 22 the ""Philosopher"" and concludes with the final symphony, no. 104, ""London"".  Here is a numbered list of the symphonies included:  nos. 22,26,30,31,39,44,45,46,47,48,49,59,60,70,73,75,81,90,91,99,100,101,102,103,104.

The box shows the continuity of Haydn's symphonic style as well as its evolution. The works are inventive, lovely, and delightful and occasionally tragic and profound. Listening to Haydn never fails to make me feel better.

Many of the symphonies here will probably be familiar to lovers of Haydn but there is always something new to explore. They move from the archaic style of the ""Philosopher"" with its slow-fast-slow-fast movement pattern, through the gallant, to a unique highly classical style of the late symphonies. A highlight of the box set is the strong representation of the ""Sturm und Drang"" symphonies numbered in the 30s and 40s.  They are beautifully performed. The ""Sturm und Drang"" symphonies include several passionate minor-key works, including the G minor symphony, no, 39, the Trauer symphony, no. 44, and the ""La Passione"" symphony no. 49 which show the composer's sometimes underestimated serious side. Some of Haydn's better-known symphonies are not included in this collection.  Haydn composed many outstanding symphonies, and Vanguard did not set out systematically to record them all. Thus, the box does not include any of the ""Paris"" symphonies (no. 82 -- 87). It doesn't include the famous symphony no. 88 or the ""Oxford"" symphony, no. 92. It doesn't include the ""Surprise"" symphony. It does include some wonderful late works less frequently heard including symphonies 81,90, and 91.

The box includes a variety of conductors and orchestras as well as a range of Haydn symphonies. David Blum was a gifted American conductor who recorded with a small New York City ensemble, the Esterhazy Orchestra, in the 1960s. This set includes Blum's full output of Haydn symphonies (9 works) which otherwise would be difficult to find on recordings.  The Vienna State Opera Orchestra under Woldike perform the five ""London"" symphonies in the box. The Vienna Symphony and the Radio Symphony Orchestra of Zagreb also are featured under conductors Janigaro and Swaronsky.

The performances are given with clat and love and would be hard to come by elsewhere. The sound is good. This box is an outstanding, inexpensive way to listen to Haydn on a device. The box will appeal to listeners who know and love the Haydn symphonies. It probably will serve as a broad introduction to newcomers to these works as well.

An always engaging performer, he is arguably best represented in a live context such as this one. Here we get to revisit the earliest phase in Bruce Hornsby's career, which was largely a modernized version of the type of roots-rock created in the 1960s and 70s by The Band. The raw talent and passion for the music is evident. It's so nice to hear these decades-old songs in a fresh context. So glad that this recording has been issued for the listening public.

112985,18270,6832,"My great luck in finding large, outstanding compilations of classical music at bargain prices continued earlier this week when I acquired The Bach Guild's Big Haydn Box from Amazon.com for only 99 cents. This is the fourth of The Bach Guilds Big Box albums that I have added to my digital music collection, and I think I made another inspired choice.

Big Haydn Box (not to be confused with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Big-Haydn-Symphonies-Box/dp/B013THM8PA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Big Haydn Symphonies Box</a>, which I have already reviewed), features over 14 hours of Franz Joseph Haydns wonderful music. It is an extraordinarily impressive array from a variety of sub-genres within Haydns oeuvre. Haydn is known to have composed over 500 works across a large spectrum of sub-genres during his lifetime. By my count, 40 of his vocal and instrumental works appear in their entirety in Big Haydn Box. They include divertimenti, symphonies, string quartets, piano sonatas, overtures, fantasies, concertos for a variety of solo instruments, masses, and an oratorio. Each clearly shows the depth and breadth of Haydns incredibly inventive musical genius.

These recordings from the mid-20th century feature various lesser-known but world-class orchestras, conductors, chamber ensembles, choirs, and solo instrumentalists and vocalists who hail mostly from eastern Europe. All of them demonstrate the highest degree of artistry and musicianship in each of their performances. They do a wonderful job of conveying the full emotional power and drama that Haydn infused into his music. I have now listened to well over half of this album and I think the audio quality of these mostly older stereophonic recordings is clean, crisp, and well-balanced.

Of the four Big Box albums I have acquired thus far, I rank Big Haydn Box right alongside&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Big-Mozart-Box/dp/B00B5Q7M90/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Big Mozart Box</a>&nbsp;as one of the best in my digital music library.

113025,7270,20602,"Every track on this album is a masterpiece, though I do NOT like how Marian recycled 3 older songs instead of writing new ones. Wanna know which ones those are?

Carry Your Flag - Released twice prior to ending up on this album. The first time was on Dreamscapes (a 1999 demo) and a more modern mix of it found on CrazyShow.
I Die For You Today - This one's lyrics were penned by a fan who goes by ""The Outsider"" and, at that time, he posted it on their official mailing list. Marian liked it so much he decided to use it for a future song. A bit of side-trivia: At it's conception it was called ""I'll Die For You Today"" and was played live a few times (as far back as 2004. It sounded like the demo version you can find on the Deluxe edition).
Miracle Healing - This one was released on CrazyShow and was a powerful acoustic piece. I very much prefer the acoustic mix!

As for the other songs? They are brilliant. Phantoms is possibly the best one, whereas The Deep is.. iffy. It's way too repetitive to be enjoyable. Call Me is nice, though i do prefer the 2005 demo (the demo has a nice guitar solo, whereas this version leaves it out entirely).

I will say, though: The loudness war applies to this song tenfold. The songs are extremely loud! They must have got them as loud as they could since you can even look at the waveforms in an audio editor and it looks distorted, but it isn't. The first 2 albums aren't like this thankfully (though granted that was in the 80's)",1502668800,4

And I need you more than want you,
And I want you for all time,
And the Wichita lineman is still on the line. - Jimmy Webb

Five MEMORABLE Stars. The immortal golden hit song, Wichita Lineman was written by the legendary composer Jimmy Webb and sung by Grammy-winning singer Glen Campbell. It is one of his biggest hits amid an awesome string of hits that crossed over genres to a wide audience of fans. It is a ballad about a hardworking, pole climbing technician keeping the lines up and working for the customers. The other musicians on the recording included Campbell, session orchestra arranger Al De Lory on piano; Al Casey, James Burton, and Carol Kaye on guitars; with Don Bailey on bass, Jim Gordon on drums and a string section.

In the performance, Campbell uses his acclaimed distinctive voice, vocal sincerity and role-projection ability, as well as his guitar musicianship. The excellent arrangement of the strings is by pianist De Lory. Built upon a loping beat and backed primarily by guitars and ethereal strings with reeds and a piccolo imitating morse code. In the song, the linemans focus shifts between technicalities and problems of his job, amid his intruding thoughts about a woman that he wants and needs. Actually, Webb wrote the song inspired by driving alongside miles and miles of lines and telephone poles and seeing one solitary lineman technician in the middle of nowhere working on top of a pole, all by himself. Webb was reportedly also inspired by a failed romance. This is yet another great Glen Campbell performance that paints an indelible musical scene. My Highest Recommendation. Five FABULOUS Stars.

If I HAD to quibble, I'd say there's a bit too much of the punk in it for me: The obvious hardcore influences in the vocals and beats aside, the fast rhythms are closer to the faster songs from KMFDM and Ministry.

This just may be my favorite Sharon Jones album, maybe my favorite Daptone album in general.  If you have been thinking about purchasing a Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings album, this is a great place to start - but they are all good.  This is an album that does sound better on vinyl, the separation of the stereo mix just sounds sharper and bolder...horns in one speaker, guitars on the other, that old-school way of production.  This is the real deal, a heartfelt, soulful platter of modern yet classic American R&B.  RIP Sharon Jones.",1502668800,5

Smooth, flowing harmonies tinged with very agreeable upper octave tones with long sustain imply the vastness of space, and has a way of ""releasing"" your mind from the cares and worries of this world.  Very reminiscent of John Serrie's work, only more melodical and rhythmical, ethereal, extremely pleasing frequencies that are basically therapeutic.  Can't say much more, just listen, and enjoy.

While Buffalo Springfield wasn't around very long during their brief stint together they made some great music including ""For What It's Worth"",their most well known song. It has that classic folk-rock sound that was at its height during the mid-60s. Thought provoking lyrics that are in many ways still relevant today 50+ years later. Despite how much time has passed since this tune came out originally it sounds and feels like it was written today about society we live in now. An all-around great song to download.",1502755200,5

113159,470,4306,"Released in 2014, BROAD IS THE GATE is Saint's tenth studio album, if you include their short debut WARRIORS OF THE SON (I don't know if it's technically an EP or what). This album's marked by new vocalist Brian Phyll Miller who's so different from Josh Kramer and main man Richard Lynch (who sounded similar, although only Josh could hit the high notes) that it changes the sound of the band significantly. It thus took me a long time to catch a grip with this album but, once I did, it's a solid Saint release.

The album's short at only 31 minutes, but this is actually refreshing with all the overlong CDs out there. Although BROAD IS THE GATE doesn't rank up there with Saint's top albums, like THE REVELATION (aka THE MARK), HELL BLADE and DESERATE NIGHTS, like I said, it's a solid Saint album and one of their best in regards to production values. The more I hear Brian Phyll Miller, the more I like him. I just had to get used to his sound. ""We Will Fight"" is heavy and modern-sounding while the haunting ""Never Same"" interestingly throws in symphonic elements, sorta like the excellent ""Everlasting God"" from CRIME SCENE EARTH.

113168,470,16650,"Released in 2016, XI is Metal Church's eleventh album (naturally), marking the return of second frontman Mike Howe after 23 years absence. XI is their fourth album with Howe, which means both Howe and Munroe are tied with four studio albums each. Original singer David Wayne did three, but since he released his own METAL CHURCH album in 2001 and it was originally slated to BE a Metal Church album (until Vanderhoof changed his mind), he arguably did four as well.

To be expected, XI sounds like the four previous Ronny Munroe albums, except with Howe singing. Whether you prefer Munroe or Howe is a matter of personal taste. I like 'em both but don't love 'em; neither possesses Wayne's special appeal IMHO, e.g. his moving falsetto. However, if backed up against a wall concerning Munroe and Howe, I'd probably pick Munroe because he's closer to Wayne's style. That said, Howe's certainly stalwart & passionate and can really nail a song, like ""Fake Healer.""

So what about XI? It's a solid Metal Church album that will grow on you, like the five previous Metal Church releases. While it doesn't contain anything of the caliber of ""Watch the Children Pray,"" ""Fake Healer"" or ""Beyond the Black,"" it nevertheless has a few tracks that stand out, like the melancholic-but-compelling ""No Tomorrow"" and the driving ""Killing Your time,"" both of which were advance releases. The kinetic/proggy opener ""Reset"" was also released in advance as a video a week before the album's debut.

The punchy closing song ""Suffer Fools"" is one of the best while the mysterious & groovin' ""Needle & Suture"" is one of my favorites. Most of the songs are embellished with eerie, atmospheric parts with some whole tracks having that vibe, like ""Sky Falls In"" and ""It Waits."" There are also some interesting experimental ditties or parts, like ""Shadow."" Howe sounds like he never left.

113224,11535,20400,"Huge fan of RW.  Not a big fan of overly political rants.  In the past he had a great way of expressing his thoughts and emotion (he is THE Master at that) in ways that were universal.  I am just not able to get into any artist or music that sings ""F Trump"" OR ""F Obama.""  He can do as he wishes of course, but it bums me out.

I love the Waters dominated Floyd stuff from Dark Side to Final Cut, and his previous solo albums are awesome.  Roger I still love you and respect you even when I don't agree.  Bless You.",1502841600,3

113243,470,20609,"Released in 2009 and on CD in 2012, BRUSH-FIRES OF THE MIND is the first of two releases by the Jon Schaffer project Sons of Liberty; the second being an EP, SPIRIT OF THE TIMES, which has yet to be released on CD. Schaffer sings, plays guitar and programmed the drum machine, but Sons of Liberty also include a number of guest musicians, like Jim Morris, Ruben Drake, Troy Seele, Howard Helm and Jeff Brandt. The music, of course, sounds like Iced Earth, Jons main band (aduh), while his vocals aren't far removed from Matt Barlows, albeit less Paul Stanley-ish.

To be expected from the name, the Sons of Liberty project is politically-themed, based on two works  The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve by G. Edward Griffin and America: Freedom to Fascism by Aaron Russo. Its about the bankers who own the politicians and the unconstitutional existence of the Federal Reserve. Schaffer is very passionate about these issues and the topic is interesting, albeit one note, which will turn some people off, particular those who suffer from illogical libertine (non)ideology.

For comparison, I prefer the two Sons of Liberty albums (LP and EP) to DYSTOPIA (2011) and PLAGUES OF BABYLON (2014); but favor CRUCIBLE OF MAN (2008), FRAMING ARMAGEDDON (2007), THE GLORIOUS BURDEN (2004) and HORROR SHOW (2001) to Sons of Liberty. A couple highlights: Dont Tread on Me with its potent Hail Caesar, All Hail shouted-chant that closes out the song; and the opener, ""Jekyll Island,"" with its muscular chorus.

113304,18270,15675,"In my quest to find large, outstanding compilations of classical music at bargain prices, I have been very successful, unearthing several Big Box MP3 albums from The Bach Guild for 99 cents. They include&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Big-Mozart-Box/dp/B00B5Q7M90/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Big Mozart Box</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Big-Haydn-Box/dp/B00CMAM8QA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Big Haydn Box</a>, and others. So far, I have found each of them a delightful listening experience.

I recently added Bigger Beethoven Box to my digital library. This is the second of two Big Box albums featuring the works of Ludwig van Beethoven, and it is very good. It contains a wide selection of Beethovens compositions, including a comprehensive offering of his piano sonatas, his only violin concerto, his complete Diabelli variations and piano concertos, four of his nine symphonies, as well as dances, songs, rondos, bagatelles, and other works. All are performed with a high degree of artistry by a variety of world-class, but lesser known musicians.

Although I think Bigger Beethoven Box it is very good, and certainly upholds the high standards of the other Big Box sets I own, I am slightly less enamored of it. This is mainly due to two reasons:

1. There are no string quartets or piano trios on ""Bigger Beethoven Box."" Many of Beethovens greatest chamber music masterpieces belong to these two sub-genres, and I think the fact that  none of them are included makes this a less comprehensive and well-rounded album.

2. The albums engineering is not quite as good as it is on other Big Box albums  especially Big Mozart Box and Big Haydn Box. On most tracks, the sound is bright, clear, and well-balanced, but on a few others, the audio quality seems murky to my ears, and individual instruments are sometimes difficult for me to hear.

Despite my concerns about Bigger Beethoven Box, I still think it is a very good sampler of Ludwig van Beethovens music. With first-rate performances by world-class musicians, its (for the most part) excellent audio quality, and its low price of 99 cents, it makes for an overall highly rewarding listening experience.

113491,18270,9935,"Last week I found another phenomenal classical music bargain at Amazon.com: Haydn: Complete String Quartets on the VoxBox label. Featuring the Dekany Quartet and the Fine Arts Quartet, this splendid MP3 album contains nearly 24 hours of Franz Joseph Haydns string quartets, all brilliantly performed by the two ensembles mentioned above.

This MP3 VoxMegaBox Edition contains all of the string quartets in Haydns oeuvre, including some that are credited to him that he may not have composed. The works are placed in opus number order, from earliest to latest, so listeners can hear the progression of Haydns musical thinking and development over his many decades of composing in this genre.

The Dekany Quartet plays just over half of the 70-plus works that appear on this album, and the Fine Arts Quartet plays the remainder. The musicianship of these two ensembles is exquisite throughout. They consistently engage their instruments in those finely balanced musical conversations that make well-played string quartets such a joyful listening experience for me. Their interpretations are flawless, showing every bit of the emotion and intellect that Haydn wrote into each one of his chamber music masterworks. There are some subtle differences between the two ensembles in tone, texture, and color, but overall, I find it difficult to tell them apart.

The audio quality on Haydn: Complete String Quartets is crisp, clean, and precise. My ears can easily detect each of the four lines playing in every string quartet. On rare occasions, the first violin sounds a trifle over-bright, but this in no way detracts from my overall listening pleasure.

When Haydn: Complete String Quartets first came out at Amazon.com in 2015, it apparently sold for $2.99  an extraordinary bargain. Now, even at over three times that price ($9.49), I think it remains one of the best classical music values to be found anywhere. Its low price, combined with its exquisite performances and exceptional audio quality, makes it a must-have in every digital classical music library. Most highly recommended.",1503187200,5

113524,8850,20621,"Few people realize nowadays that Claude Debussy was an outstanding pianist. This album testifies to that. Excellent sound and recording quality, too... don't be fooled by the compressed samples! The basses are a little hefty, which is good for average small mp3 devices with headphones, but need to be balanced out on a bigger sound system.
The only downside is the lack of information about the details, like when the original recordings (obviously piano rolls) were made, what system (Welte Mignon? Ampico?) was used, what piano is being used for the recording / remastering. Nevertheless, this is an important reference work and valuable audio documentation.",1503187200,5

In addition, there are nine bonus cuts to fill out disc one - with three B-sides - including several live at Paramuont Theatre and two live at Del Mar - including one that I don't remember at all - the very happening ""Been A Son"". Disc two is nearly as fantastic with eight (8) songs from the Smart Studio Sessions including their Velvet Underground cover ""Here She Comes Now"" + eight tracks from the Boombox Rehearsals and two songs from the BBC.

113611,18478,18069,"This collection of seven hours of music from the archives of Vanguard Records consists of ragtime piano and related piano music beautifully performed by a variety of artists. These recordings are irreplaceable in their own right; having them available for less than one dollar is extraordinary.

Ragtime is a unique American music that flourished in the late 19th century until about 1920. Interest in ragtime revived in the 1970s and has remained strong. I have played ragtime on the piano, and this collection helped refresh and revive my love for this music.

Scott Joplin is the greatest and best-known ragtime composer. This collection includes what appears to be all of Joplin's solo piano music -- ragtime, marches, and dances -- performed by William Bolcom and John Arpin.  A noted composer of ragtime in his own right and the winner of a Pulitzer Prize, Bolcom opens this collection with 16 Joplin works played in strongly rhythmical, musical style. Among the works are the famous ""The Entertainer"", the waltz ""Bethena"" and ""Elite Syncopations.  The Canadian composer and pianist John Arpin (1936 -- 2007) performs two large sets of Joplin's works. I had previously heard Arpin in a CD of the ragtime music of Joseph Lamb.  He plays in a light, lyrical, and yet virtuosic style that is a joy to hear. His performances were for me the highlight of this collection. Among the many works I enjoyed were the ""Heliotrope Bouquet"" (which Joplin wrote with Louis Chauvin), the ""Silver Swan Rag"" (a beautiful work probably by Joplin) and the ""Wall Street Rag""

James Scott and Joseph Lamb are usually considered the other two main composers of ragtime in the company of Joplin. Scott is underrepresented on this box with only two rags, ""Grace and Beauty"" and ""Hilarity Rag"" performed by ""Mr. Ragtime"", the pianist and author Max Morath (b. 1926). There are many ways to play rag, and Morath is less classically-influenced than Bolcom or Arpin. In addition to the two Scott rags, Morath performs works by the lesser-known George Botsford, and Ted Snyder on this set.

Morath also plays ""The American Beauty Rag"", my favorite ragtime piece, by Joseph Lamb. The set also includes a set of additional ragtime compositions of Lamb performed by Virginia Eskin.  Eskin (b. 1941) remains an active performer and lecturer who specializes in the work of women composers. In addition to performing Joseph Lamb, her recordings in this box include works by several little-known women composers of ragtime, including Mary Aufderheide, Geraldine Dobyns, Irene Cozad, Julia Lee Niebergall, Charlotte Blake, Irene Giblin, Gladys Yelvington, Adaline Shepherd, and Marian Davis (""Fluffy Ruffle Girls Rag""). It was a delight to get to know something of these composers.

In addition to the collection of ragtime, this set also includes a great deal of piano music by the American composer Louis Moreau Gottschalk (1829 -- 1869) Gottschalk was a virtuoso pianist and composer who wrote a great deal of romantic and Creole-influenced music for the piano that has some strong similarities to ragtime. His music is well-represented in this collection with performances of solo works by Eugene List and duets by List and Reid Nibley.  Gottschalk's music is an excellent complement to the ragtime in this collection.

There is a wealth of music in this collection that helped me brighten hours and days. The collection sent me back to the piano to try to play again some of the rags I played not too long ago. It is possible to put this music on one's device, and then just relax and enjoy.  I enjoyed, though, listening the the music a little at a time to try to savor each work and each performer. This collection reminded me of the breadth of American creativity and of the joy of ragtime and music.

Anyways, great, rock album. Big fan of Matt Helders, the drummer from the amazing Arctic Monkeys, and although I'm not a fan of Josh Homme's Queens of the Stone Age Band, his instrument playing and production on this album is very admirable. The best way I can describe it is if you took the Berlin era sound (albums ""The Idiot""/""Lust for Life"") and the singing/lyrics of ""American Caesar"". Don't get me wrong- this is not a rehash using popular albums a framework for success. The album is very modern. In a few years after the novelty has worn off, I suspect I'll still consider a few of these songs ( ""Gardenia"", ""Sunday"") top-pop!",1503360000,5

113719,9857,10152,"In some ways this 2012 album will be more what Loureiros' fans will be expecting than, say, Universo Inverso from 2006. This is because it is a more 'rock' oriented instrumental electric guitar album. We get a few speeds on this offering and it's not solely a one-dimensional shred album but it's far more committed to the cause.

A stand out track to sample would be El Guajiro - all sorts of bright and sprightly things happening on this one. And there are other tracks on here its equal such as the more lumbering The Hymn. And this is what makes this a fine electric guitar album to pick up if you have a hankering for some. And for anyone not familiar with this guitarist this is a fairly handy entry point since it is indicative of his 'home turf' and not chock full of experimentation as some guitarists are won't to do on their solo releases.",1503446400,4

Now the longer songs are actually pretty solid and enjoyable. Not very unique sound wise but still worth listening to. I can see why people bought the deluxe version over the normal release.

114046,1108,20642,"The movie ""The Last Unicorn"" was a huge part of my childhood -- it was one of my favorite movies, and our family ended up renting and watching it so many times we broke the rental tape.  As an adult I've revisited both the movie and the novel it's based on, and fallen in love with it all over again.  Its theme song, written by Jimmy Webb and performed by the band America, is also very dear to my heart, and though I enjoy Kenny Loggins' cover of it, I always thought nothing could top the original.

I thought that... until I heard the song covered by the most unlikely of sources -- a YouTube-based comedy band with the ridiculous name of Ninja Sex Party.  They may not be as iconic as the original song, but boy do they deliver a gorgeous and haunting rendition of a beloved song.  The electronic accompaniment is a little jarring at first, but it's more than made up for by the singer's earnest, haunting delivery and magnificent voice.  It's very clear that this song by an otherwise goofy band is a labor of love, and that makes the song all the better in my opinion.

Despite the wacky name of the cover artists, this song is necessary listening for all fans of ""The Last Unicorn.""  And even though it will never replace America's version, it's still stunning in its own right, and a wonderful tribute to a cult-classic film and song.",1503964800,5
114047,18403,18650,Sounds good. Not enough music on this cd.,1503964800,5
114048,17886,17869,"Band's seventh studio album (digital release only) titled, ""Wanderlust."" Contains eight tracks produced by Pharrell Williams and was released on June 10, 2016. Karen Fairchild describes the album as, ""It's not a country album"" ""And it's not like anything we've ever done. It's fun to be spontaneous and put it out there to the fans, because we want to, and not to overthink it, but just because it has brought us a lot of joy, and we think it will for them as well.

114068,1402,19806,"I notice that every time they release multiple soundtrack albums of something--like one for each Bond film, for each ""Star Wars"" film--they always make sure the ""official theme"" is on each. Which is cool--most people aren't ""completists"" with movie soundtracks and only buy the one they like best or the only one they saw. But in my case, I bought this ""both seasons"" set rather than each season individually. And a less-spooky version of ""Edelweiss"" has always been on my ""Sound Of Music"" soundtrack. I hear there's going to be a third season--what'll they do when it comes to a soundtrack album for that one? There's a companion album with a lot of the music the characters heard in clubs, on jukeboxes, over the radio and so on in the course of the series. I passed on that because the Japanese version of ""End Of the World"" wasn't on it--only one in English, similar to Skeeter Davis' original version. Maybe the Japanese one should have been included here. As for this album, though, I'm glad I wasn't paying enough attention when I watched the series to catch what music goes with American SS officer John Smith's shoving a fellow officer who posed a threat to him off the headquarters building in New York.",1503964800,4

Small MP3 complaint, while the sets are divided by disc, they are not by their album title, rater ""Sound System"". Easy enough to divide and re-label on your own if you want to.

She is a wunderkind of all that is out of proportion in your life and sent to build it back up.  In this industry of half-naked vocalist who use sex to sell their weapons, India is a weapon herself, sent to guide your soul to the earthy regions of the universe and transform you into something filled with tranquility and peace.

After the 3rd day of this beautiful song on continous play in your head you might start to go mad. Not even Psycho Killer by Talking Heads will get it out. All that ends up happening is you'll have both songs playing in a loop, back to back, day after day in your head. You can't sleep, can't eat. You just twitch and giggle for no reason until finally ....poof! They're gone and the only thing left in your head is the thought of how sleepy and hungry you are and how you should take care of that.

If you like the others in this series, you will like this one too.

114288,7782,10290,"I'm a long time Joni fan and this album will offers a lot me and other long devotees for a glimpse of the very early Joni playing live in front of a small audience: her and her guitar. Hearing how the introduces songs and interacts with the crowd and plays around is a bit like being a time traveler.

Like so many ""early"" albums the recording quality is pretty rough, but Joni still comes through for me and it's more like proof of its early origins. The quality doesn't matter to me. In some ways this is like any prequel: early Steppenwolf, Fleetwood Mac, Johnny Winter and so forth. This album shows the early Joni Mitchell who later became the influential artist I grew up with and influenced me so much.

This a bookend at the start of her long career and musical journey and was missing from my collection. It provides an anchor on her musical journey. But enough philosophy/navel gazing! It's just a darn good listen for any Joni lover.

The bottom line for me is this recording brings me into an intimate performance with one of my favorite artists. I get a sense of being in the audience back in 66 in a way that Miles of Aisles and Shadows and Light  don't do even with their clear technical superiority. To me this album isn't about the recording quality or technical details; it's just about Joni playing to a small crowd and having fun on her way to become one of the great musicians of her generation. Obviously I think this is 5 stars! It has technical issues but to me they are like proof of authenticity and don't detract.",1504224000,5

114315,18579,20661,"In a very talented and crowded field, I would name John Hiatt the best American songwriter of the last 30 years. And then there's The Voice -

As if I didn't love him enough, Mr. Hiatt performed in the freezing snow one time at Yosemite, after a lot of lightweights had returned to their shelters and tents. He was sweet and uncomplaining, and proceeded to give us diehards the most intimate, unforgettable experience.

I usually try to post a particularly poetic passage in songs, but Hiatt leaves me no choice, I have to post the entire thing.

I've been taking off and landing, but this airport's closed
And how much thicker this fog is gonna get, god only knows
Just when you think that you've got a grip
Reality sneaks off, it gives you the slip
As if you ever knew what it was, taking you down the line

chorus
[Tearing through the cottonfields and bus shelters
Of the south running helter skelter
Down through the MississippI Delta
With no place to call your own

Mixing up drinks with mixed feelings
All along the paint was peeling
Down to an Indian blanket on a pony
With no rider in the flesh and bone
Looking for his Buffalo River home]

I've been circling the wagons down at Times Square
Trying to fill up this hole in my soul but nothing fits there
Just when you think you can let it rip
You're pounding the pavement in your daddy's wingtips
As if you had some place to go
Or a better way to get there

[chorus]

Now there's only two things in life but I forget what they are
It seems we're either hanging on a moonbeam's coat tails, or wishing on stars
Just when you think that you've been gyped
The bearded lady comes and does a double back flip
And you run off and join the circus
Yeah, you just let that pony ride

The only downside is that there aren't any songs from Axis.., although the liner notes speculate that Jimi may have performed some of these tracks a the following day, but the show was cancelled because of rain.

114361,9860,684,"This is what the 70s sounded like when I was a kid. Now that I'm halfway through 48, I can lean back, relax, and remember why I fell in love with Roberta Flack in the first place. I mean, besides a truly memorable name that hits you from the side, the song is truly gorgeous. From the siren-like vocals near the beginning, dredging up memories of my past, to the chimes of a triangle, not heard much anymore in what I like, and the harmonizing background vocals, I fell in love all over again when I heard it recently. Truly as classic as The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face and Where Is The Love!!! Take me back, Roberta, just take me back...",1504396800,5
114362,6346,20664,"""STARS ""  album  by CHER was released in 1975 her first release for Warner Brothers is here as a CD. I think the problem why this CD
was not successful was because Cher was coming off her TV show and her MCA recordings. For this CD  Cher sings 9 songs  penned by 9
male songwriter's and 1 by  female songwriter Janis Ian ( Stars)  the  album was  produced by Jimmy Webb. This album is  recorded, produced,
and sung by Cher  just  beautifully. Her version of ""These  Days"" by Jackson Browne is amazing. Every song on this CD fits perfectly.
This is Cher as a mature, serious singer with  the ability to do these songs as they should be. ""Just this one time"" is the best thing
Cher has ever recorded the range of her singing this song is down right perfection.  We all  know  Cher  is a great actress and i think
 this comes out in her singing this songs with such emotion and feeling. If you read the reviews you will see all Cher's fans love this
CD. We need Cher to do a complete album with songs recorded where great song  writer's give her the chance to sing the songs
her way.  The  dance able  releases by Cher were great for it's time but now Cher let's get back to a great rock, ballad release.  .",1504396800,5

114590,373,15941,"... I have found that I react differently than MOST people to GREAT tunes. It doesn't matter which genre the tunes come from, either! What is bad, IS BAD. I suspect there are a LOT of music fans out there that understands. I know your out there, right? Here's what happens: When I hear an extraordinarily bad a$$ song, I break out in goose bumps. And this...indescribable... I guess you'd say, numbing WAVE of chills climbs my spine and I'm totally frozen for about a half a minute or so; kinda depends on just how Bad To The Bone the song IS. It varies greatly. I don't understand it...but, once I unfreeze, I run over stuff to get to Amazon and buy the song! I pay for songs, so that I can listen to them ANYTIME. I buy devices with GINORMOUS STORAGE JUST FOR THAT PURPOSE. Having a bad day? I put in my buds... pick a selection, just like this song by SIN SHAKE SIN!

114842,56,20032,"Whenever I do think of Alicia Keys, I do know that she is a strong & soulful songstress that has never gotten older with age, her songs have honestly gotten better with time & space. She has shown real beauty & soul from the voice within with each note she has sung. But it is surprising that it has been over 15 years since she broke out with Songs In A Minor. The album had launched her soulful reign as one of the most premiere artists of the 2000 decade & beyond. Whenever I listen to Songs In A Minor, I do enjoy each track from start to finish. Fallin' is absolutely one of my favorites & her third single A Woman's Worth is also one song that shows real beauty from the eyes of a lady, into what a man wants at the heart from someone to stand by him. I really love how deep the soul is from Alicia, but a lot of people have forgotten about this song after awhile. Still, when you listen to Alicia Keys, you know she is in the pantheon of the greatest songstresses in the world, whether it is Whitney Houston, Roberta Flack or Nina Simone. If you never heard a Alicia Keys song, well I suggest you check this one out.

Even though it sounds good and definitely sounds great
considering the song is very old
SOMEONE DID GREAT!!!! ON
The sound. However when u touch the 30 sec. Button it sounds so much louder then after the download
Volume is still good quality not far off
FOR EXAMPLE ur stereo system goes up to 20 the 30 sec sounds like you only have to turn it up to 10 but
AFTER Downloading it ur going to have to turn it up to About 15 to get the same sound level GREAT JOB!!
Most important thing is that most down loads arn't this good",1505260800,4

I learned a couple of things about this duo who scraped together different styles as they were developing their own harmonic sounds. This record is pretty much an acoustic fare with their voices and guitars and their original works like Sparrow and The Sound of Silence and He Was My Brother stand head and shoulders above their covering of others songs (yes, even above Bob Dylans The Times They Are A-Changin). The mix is like a stew that gives you different flavors and textures in each bite, and doesnt taste like it really goes together, but every so often you get a particular savory taste that hits some of the right notes and you realize that you're willing to try more. The CD comes with liner notes written by Garfunkel about Simons songs. I enjoy these little peaks behind the curtains.",1505260800,3

115013,18270,12069,"In my continuing quest to find large, outstanding compilations of classical music at bargain prices, I have been very successful, unearthing several Big Box MP3 albums from The Bach Guild for 99 cents. They include&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Little-Big-Box-Bach-Orchestral-Music/dp/B00KS0ASOU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Little Big Box :: Bach Orchestral Music</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Big-Handel-Oratorio-Box/dp/B00KICWEN6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Big Handel Oratorio Box</a>, and others. So far, I have found each of them a delightful listening experience.

I recently added Big Beethoven Box to my digital library. This is the first of two Big Box albums featuring the works of Ludwig van Beethoven (the other being&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bigger-Beethoven-Box/dp/B01BHELQD2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bigger Beethoven Box</a>, which I have previously reviewed), and it is very good. It contains a wide selection of Beethovens compositions, including piano sonatas, cello sonatas, string quartets, three of his nine symphonies, incidental music for The Creatures of Prometheus and Egmont, as well as piano variations, minuets, sonatinas, overtures, rondos, and other works. All are performed with a high degree of artistry by a variety of world-class, but lesser known musicians.

Although I think Big Beethoven Box it is very good, and certainly upholds the high standards of the other Big Box sets I own, I do have two minor reservations about it:

1. There are no piano trios on ""Big Beethoven Box."" Some of my favorite Beethoven chamber music masterpieces  especially his Archduke and Ghost trios  belong to this sub-genre, and I think the fact that none of them are included makes this a less comprehensive and well-rounded album.

2. The albums engineering does not quite rise to the level of the best Big Box albums  especially&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Big-Mozart-Box/dp/B00B5Q7M90/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Big Mozart Box</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Big-Haydn-Box/dp/B00CMAM8QA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Big Haydn Box</a>. On most tracks, the sound is bright, clear, and well-balanced, but on a few others, the audio quality seems murky to my ears, and individual instruments are sometimes difficult for me to hear.  There are also a few technical glitches to the album that require manual editing of individual tracks metadata. (See reviewer Upstate Listeners excellent review for tips on how to fix these problems.)

Despite my concerns about Bigger Beethoven Box, I still think it is a very good sampler of Ludwig van Beethovens music. With first-rate performances by world-class musicians, its (for the most part) excellent audio quality, and its low price of 99 cents, it makes for an overall highly rewarding listening experience. Highly recommended.  (4 Stars ^ 5)",1505347200,5

And I'm unfamiliar with The Script as a band, or with the work of will.i.am beyond the ""Samurai Jack"" theme song (yes, I'm a cartoon buff...).  But a family member introduced me to this song, a collaboration by both bands... and I found it to be an amazing song.  Not just for having a catchy beat and lyrics that are actually intelligible and (fairly) clean, but for having an incredibly inspiring message as well.  It's not just a good song, but a powerful anthem toward being the best you can be and following your dreams.  And while that may seem like a saccharine message in our day and age, it's still a meaningful one, and one we need to remember.

This song makes me want to check out more of The Script's work... and perhaps give more of the work of will.i.am a shot.  I may not be a rap fan, but if there are songs like this out there, maybe I'll dip a toe into the genre a little more...",1505520000,5

115072,1758,16005,"Prince's final album, ""HITNRUN Phase Two,"" is a bittersweet affair for obvious reasons. It's heartbreaking to listen to it and realize how much Prince had left in the tank, as it's his most inspired album release since ""3121."" The writing, the hooks, the grooves and the playing are classic Prince, and he sounds directly involved in the collaborations and arrangements in a way he hasn't since perhaps ""Parade."" That said, you can't help but truly be happy that His Royal Badness ended his career on a remarkably high note, leaving behind an album that can stand with his earlier classics.

From start to finish, ""HITNRUN Phase Two,"" is a breezy, beautiful and fun record. Several of the songs - ""Rock and Roll Love Affair,"" ""2Y2D,"" ""Xtraloveable,"" ""Screwdriver,"" and ""Big City"" - had been regularly performed live dating as far back as 2011, giving Prince plenty of time to perfect them for the studio. ""Xtraloveable"" was and is an especially welcome inclusion: it's the oldest song on here, dating back to 1982, and was a beloved and much sought after outtake by fans for years. It sees the light a day in a slightly less naughty but absolutely funky and fun update, with Prince sounding like he's having a blast.

Other standouts include the socially conscious ""Baltimore,"" the lovely ballad ""Look at Me, Look at U,"" and the haunting, quietly epic ""Revelation,"" which features one final epic guitar solo from Prince. The album's closing cut, the Andy Allo collaboration ""Big City,"" isn't a grand farewell, but it's a sweet, touching final declaration of love in the vein of ""Adore"" and others.

""HITNRUN Phase Two"" is a touching final statement from the greatest artist of the last 40 years, in the zone for one last time and relishing every minute of it. If only we know what else we could have had.",1505520000,5
115073,12947,13204,"I give the first three tracks 5 stars. In fact, I only purchased the first three tracks. I have hundreds of sound-bites that I use for relaxation or meditation, however I was searching for a 'rolling thunder' effect, not an all out thunder storm, there are plenty of those to choose from and this is the only one that has a 'distant rolling thunder' effect with light-moderate rain sounds. I simply loop all three tracks randomly and it gives a nice sense of a rainy day with the hint of rolling thunder in the distance. The other tracks, I'm afraid, have a distinct contrast from the first three and are therefore distracting from the mood I was seeking to create.",1505520000,5

""I got a feeling that I can't let go."" by ""Caught A Ghost""

Five HIP Stars! The Amazon Originals TV show ""Bosch"" stars Titus Welliver as the hardboiled, jazz-loving, world weary LAPD detective, Harry Bosch, and the show is supported by an outstanding cast. The main theme is well known to ""Bosch"" fans for both the mirrored upside down visuals in the show's title credits and it's laid back, infectious, and swinging theme music ""Can't Let Go"" by LA singer, songwriter, producer, and DJ Jesse Nolan, performing under the group name ""Caught A Ghost"". The haunting song swings hard with jazzy violins, driving drums and bass, Nolan's unusual lyrics and delivery, and the muted hip trumpet playing the theme. Bosch fans can finally hear the entire track from the album ""Human Nature"". Highly Recommended. Five INTENSE Stars! (Label: +1 Records. 1-MP3 track, streamed from Amazon Prime Music. Time-2:57.)",1505520000,5

115122,17321,2950,"Caught this at the end of some movie...thought, wow, that's a very rocked out cover of a good song.  Don't have any Godsmack in my collection but often times I discover new music due to a cover (Big Sugar's cover of Dear Mr. Fantasy, Lenny Kravitz cover of American Woman, and how about the cover of While my Guitar Gently Weeps by Regina Spektor?  Awesome cover).

When I went to grab this cut I discovered Godsmack also covered Rocky Mountain Way and Time (Joe Walsh and Pink Floyd).  Grabbed all 3, like all three a lot.  RMW and Time were both pretty good rock songs when released.  Godsmack is pretty faithful to the original cuts but give both songs some very good attitude adjustments - really nice guitar work, very nicely done Godsmack.

Come Together was a fairly typical Beatles song, soft rock maybe?  Hard to classify Beatles songs (I guess that's why they are so loved).  Godsmack rocks this song and gives it a whole new sound.  And yet, they still somehow remain faithful to the original song, the original sound.

I'm a fan - their versions of these three songs show great respect for The Beatles, Walsh and Floyd - but still give us something fresh and...fresh and Godsmacked!",1505606400,5

115237,5052,14044,"Here is a set of inexpensive Mendelssohn  that I would highly recommend. I found it while rummaging around Amazon for some of the other cheap Mendelssohn sets. At $3.29, this IS a bit more than a buck--a price we've gotten used to from Bach Guild--but it has a selling point that distinguishes it from other good and inexpensive sets we mentioned: i.e.. all eight books of Mendelssohn's Songs Without Words and the three piano sonatas, played by the Romanian pianist (now settled in Belgium) Dana Protopopescu.

I'd never heard of her before, but I think she's really good. I have found other performances of selections of the Songs w/o Words a little gooey, but Dana P plays them with great clarity and an understated lyricism--which makes a great difference. Also, hearing the whole set, 48 pieces in all, conveys the shape and scope of Mendelssohn's achievement.

There is a multi-disc set of Mendelssohn: Piano Works, Piano Trios, which sells for about 40 bucks. About half of that collection is in the $3 set. This price differential works for me... Anyway, a review of the larger set made me decide to buy this less expensive download, and this review is so accurate that I'm going to quote most of it here. The review's focus begins with the piano sound:
""One of the best pianos that I have ever heard on a recording, and I am a piano technician. That was the main reason for purchasing it, since one hardly ever hears a softer hammer and well-voiced hammers on a piano recording anymore. It is also a pleasure to hear something other than a Steinway. It is probably a Bosendorfer. They don't credit the piano, something that should be done on all recordings. The performance of Dana Protopopescu is perfection. She gave accurate interpretations without the nonsense of exaggeration, with very clean execution, and careful use of the pedal.""

Protopopescu's piano does sound like a Bosendorfer to me, too, and the description of the recording and the playing is right on the button.

The 100 Essentials also contains Mendelssohn's 3rd Symphony with Toscanini and the NBC SO and the 5th Symphony in an excellent recording by Maazel and the Berlin PO. The violin concerto features the famous Heifetz, Munch, Boston SO recording. How these diverse recordings from various sources were brought together in a single package, I can't quite explain. But anyway, while there are other goodies, I think this is very much worth buying for the piano performances by Protopopescu alone",1505865600,5

Anyway, I ordered this to appease whatever urge is lurking in the back of my brain and now I love the music!  There is a good variety, several are familiar, ""Happy Days Are Here Again"" for one.  It is not all scratchy-sounding, like I thought it might be, and is just generally good fun to listen to, the lyrics are as great as the music!  Puts me in a good mood whenever I play it.

Lyrics
We walked the loneliest mile
We smile without any style
We kiss all together wrong
No intention
We lie about each other's drinks
We live without each other
Thinking what anyone would do
Without me and you
It's like I told you
Only the lonely can play
So hold on here we go
Hold on to nothin' we know
I feel so lonely
Way up here
You mention the time we were together
So long ago well I don't remember
All I know is it makes me feel good now
It's like I told you only the lonely can play
Only the lonely only the lonely can play
Only the lonely only the lonely can play
It's like I told you only the lonely can play
Only the lonely
Only the lonely can play",1506124800,5

115364,3739,6832,"Like all Bach Guild 'Big Box' collections, this is a terrific value - in this case, 14 hours and 6 minutes (according to my iTunes tracklist) and 184 tracks of music, 14 of Haydn's symphonies plus a good selection of his other works - string quartets, masses, divertimento. Haydn wrote so much music that it's not reasonable to expect anything close to 'completeness' in such a collection, but what is offered here is a very good sampling and a good starting point for anyone exploring Haydn for the first time.

The point of these collections, in my opinion, is not that the absolute qualify of the music is necessarily the best. Classical collectors and serious Mahler listeners will have other performances they prefer, and nobody is claiming that this set or similar sets are the top rated performances of this music.

I value these Bach Guild sets because of the value they represent, both for experienced collectors but especially for those who would like to dip their toes into classical music to see what it's all about. It is extraordinary, really, to be able to build a collection of fine music for such a reasonable price.

Then, after learning the music, becoming more familiar with it, there will be the natural desire to explore other performances. For those listeners, they can go further and obtain other downloads, or really 'splurge' and buy more 'normal' priced CD collections.

Regardless, this is a terrific value, and the performances are fully worth listening to. I've had this particular Bach Guild set since purchasing it in 2013, in fact, and it's about time I posted a review here to express my opinion on the worthiness of this set!",1506124800,5

115407,17601,2717,"Anyone with direct experience of infidelity - the numbers seem to grow annually - would probably really appreciate having an international platform on which to air their grievances. The concept definitely has its appeal: one person betrays another and the betrayer receives a presumably well-deserved dressing-down accessible to thousands or perhaps millions of people. Who wouldn't want that kind of outlet? Though the threat of such exposure likely won't eliminate or even reduce these situations from humanity's intimate relations, it may provide some consolation and opportunities for healing to the betrayed. Of course, the number of people with feasible recourse to mass accusation remains somewhat on an infinitesimal level. Most people turn to the obvious sources of family and friends when confronted with a demeaning and egregious loss of trust in a loved one. Perhaps social media now serves as an additional platform for venting loss on an even wider scale, at least for those seeking it, in our increasingly attention-hungry society. Others may choose to suffer and heal in private, camouflaged from the potential messiah complexes and morbid curiosities that inevitably lurk in any public sphere. Either way, those who both possess a large audience and also wish to share their damaged feelings, warts and all, with a wider population may indirectly assist those without such means in coping with their own deeply personal experiences of amorous disloyalty. The realization that even prominent public figures can face personal acts of shameful dishonesty within their own inner circles might help comfort those more lonely sufferers simply by the mere suggestion that others do experience such wrenching and humiliating pain. These same others also overcome their losses and regenerate their lives afterwards, often for the better. As such, celebrities who outwardly display their emotional upheavals through their work do risk charges of narcissism or puerile selfishness. ""Entertain us,"" some fans may exhort, ""don't whine at us!"" Yet these explicit and seemingly self-serving displays also potentially enrich and support those who seek more from entertainment than mere sensual pleasure.

Along those lines, some may have rolled their eyes upon hearing rumors of Bjork's so-called ""infidelity album."" ""Here we go again,"" they may have sighed, ""another celebrity had another inevitable celebrity breakup and she now wants the rest of us to wallow with her in her emotional misery."" Given some of the history of artists venting their personal frustrations and disappointments through their songwriting, this reaction seems somewhat understandable. Not only that, Bjork often comes under fire for ""pretentiousness"" because of her unabashed artistic and experimental approach to music and image. The esoteric title of the album, ""Vulnicura,"" meaning ""cure for wounds,"" probably didn't quiet the ""snooty police."" Not only that, some former fans have decried her move away from more ""accessible"" material, often citing the earlier album ""Homogenic"" as a yet unsurpassed peak. Though undoubtedly a fantastic album, Bjork made it clear that she had no intention of simply repeating her crowd-pleasing, best-selling, most talked about efforts. She moved on. Subsequent albums have met with almost equal praise and criticism as the music became even more complex, cutting edge and at times approaching the avant-garde. The rhythms became more staccato and jarring on ""Biophilia"" as the album's ambience seemed to simultaneously encompass both entire chunks of the universe and the most microscopic existential realms. ""Vulnicura"" continues the electronic exploration while incorporating compositional elements of ""Homogenic,"" ""Biophilia"" and aspects of ""Volta,"" but nonetheless it creates something distinct. Many of its pieces and themes apparently emerged via the healing process that accompanied a painful breakup allegedly originating from her partner's infidelity. The album overall avoids myopic individualism in its themes and instead treats them abstractly enough to allow anyone to identify or interpret the lyrics to their own circumstances. ""Vulnicura"" is not memoir.

Far from self-indulgent melodrama, ""Vulnicura"" contains some of Bjork's most stunningly beautiful and moving work. ""Stonemilker,"" an absolutely gorgeous opener saturated with strings, openly and nakedly begs for emotional expression and respect as the strings soar with painful longing. The title's intriguing meaning gets revealed in the line ""What is it that I have, that makes me feel your pain? Like milking a stone, to get you to say it."" Many people will probably identify with the analogy of ""milking a stone"" when confronted with the emotional betrayal of a loved one. Not only does it appear quite futile, any real effort at drawing milk from a stone would probably result in considerable pain. If only stones could lactate. Oh well. ""Lionsong"" seems to muse on the reaction of the betrayer to the situation at hand while also dismissing any real concern: ""Maybe he will come out of this, maybe he won't, somehow I'm not too bothered either way."" With equally juicy strings, a similar brooding mood to the previous song also pervades this second track. Such situations present a frustratingly complicated multidimensional matrix, which this song seems to examine. Will he come out? Maybe, maybe not, who cares? Well, I'm curious, but I really don't care. Also, the line ""it's a sign of maturity to be stuck in complexity"" seems to excoriate simple black and white emotional interpretations. These situations cause real anguish, confusion and perplexity that defy words. Music can sometimes get the feelings across, and ""Lionsong"" largely succeeds in communicating the inevitable miasma. The considerably more electronic ""History of Touches"" delves into a remembered intimate moment that in retrospect felt tinged with a lurking finality. But all such moments seem simultaneously omnipresent. A sensuous oneness floats above the staggering and indistinct background keyboards. ""Black Lake"" returns directly to ""Stonemilker's"" themes and mood. A sprawling ten-minute exploration of what went wrong, it occasionally explodes into storms of electronic percussion. It also includes some intriguing passages: ""You fear my limitless emotions, I am bored of your apocalyptic obsessions."" The accusations also come out in full force: ""I did it for love, I honored my feelings, you betrayed your own heart, corrupted that organ"" and ""family was always our sacred mutual mission, which you abandoned."" Some fairly intense interludes punctuate the verses. A bittersweet string melody closes the piece. ""Family"" uses digital thumps and scrapes and an eerie ambience as a foundation for mourning the death of a family, potentially the already mentioned abandoned family in ""Black Lake."" A sonically surprising bridge then suddenly interrupts the murky dirge with bouncy staccato strings. This song may represent the acceptance stage of grief. Basically, it's over, bring on the funky strings.

""Notget"" reaches a cathartic peak. Full of open throated lamentations such as ""love will keep us safe from death"" and ""I will not forget this notget, will you not regret having love let go."" The song succeeds phenomenally in portraying ominous emotions. It ranks as one of the album's most unforgettable moments. ""Atom Dance"" exudes the cosmic and molecular mood of ""Biophilia"" with plucking strings and lines such as ""I am fine tuning my soul to the universal wavelength, no one is a lover alone, I propose an atom dance."" Once again, the song quickly transforms with the voice of ANOHNI, who also dueted with Bjork on ""Volta."" Healing appears: ""we aim at peeling off dead layers of loveless love"" and ""when you feel the flow as primal love, enter the pain and dance with me!"" Then finally some signs of release appear: ""atoms are laughing at last."" ""Mouth Mantra"" hints at some kind of inexplicable verbal constipation. ""My throat was stuffed, my mouth sewn up, banned from making noise, I was not heard."" ""Quicksand"" departs somewhat from the album's underlying mood with percussion and digital giant wasp buzzes. The lyrics discuss ""our mother's philosophy"" which ""feels like quicksand."" Other interesting lines suggest energy sources to carry on: ""locate her black lake, the steam from this pit, will form a cloud, for her to live on."" This may provide an alternate to the less elegant line ""when life gives you poop, put it on your garden.""

""Vulnicura"" presents yet another dimension of Bjork's continuing artistry. Yes, it feels safe to apply that dangerous and now almost quaint word to her work. She sits directly in the tradition of ""music as art,"" arguably traceable to the Beatles, that tries to push boundaries, to not simply repeat past successes, to explore and unearth new ideas, sounds and emotions. This album contains no instantly radio-friendly or easily accessible pop hooks. And that's a good thing. The airwaves have far too much of that already. The curious human brain needs to stray away from safe cultural havens at least once in a while, and Bjork's ever evolving music continues to provide such an oasis. She hasn't stopped either. Apparently fully past the pain of the breakup that inspired ""Vulnicura,"" 2017 will apparently see another new Bjork album titled ""Utopia."" The first single, ""The Gate,"" certainly points to another indescribable and endlessly fascinating collection of songs, not to mention more stunning surreal imagery. Slowing down certainly doesn't seem like an option for Bjork at this point. ""Vulnicura"" will probably end up as one more step on what hopefully remains a long journey.",1506211200,5

115547,7245,2161,"If, like me, you owned the original Crimson & Clover LP you were one of the few to have the original long play version of the title track.  It plumb eluded me for decades, having the single version on various artist records and CD's and recently replacing my few vinyl albums with the ESSENTIALS collection from Rhino, very well remastered.  But I still missed the long album version and finally, easy as pie!  Download the version digitally and you have a remastered terrific sounding copy to take you back to 1968!  Now I'm considering buying the rest of the album just for nostalgia, you can burn your own CD this way (I've done it with quite a few hard to find items now and Amazon gets total kudos from me in that department).  This song and this version is a national treasure of the psychedelic 60's and if you are only familiar with the single version from radio days, try this out, it's a buck and a quarter well spent.  The relaxing almost Hawaiian guitar instrumentals that caress you up to the wah-wah'd processed vocals at the end are a beautiful side trip from the cut and edited single version.",1506470400,5

115566,7245,4996,"Not being a huge Depeche Mode fan but loving quite a few of their songs, VIOLATOR is the one album I loved and I will probably completely download the digital version of the album as well as other Depeche Mode tracks from various original vinyl albums.  I have never cared for the singles so much as the album versions of their songs, so this is the best way to do that.  Yes I had quite a few LP's from DM but for the most part I ended up recording audio cassettes of my favorite tracks in the order I liked them, save the Violator album.  Amazon makes doing this easy and the quality of these digital tracks are perfection.  Usually album-oriented, this is somewhat against my usual grain, but in the cases such as this, where a handful of songs will suffice, you can't argue with the price!",1506470400,5

The album ended sounding more like the Talking Heads than My Life in the Bush of Ghosts, but still has the virtues they created together in both working groups.  Strange Overtones is a perfect example with a cool dance floor groove and fairly representative of the lighter side of More Songs About Buildings and Food (which was my first Heads album and first exposure to production by Eno).  I tried this track out from Amazon before purchasing the album and if you want a ""taste"" before buying, this is a good way to go.  Amazon's digital music is always of stunning good quality, fast to download and faster to enjoy!",1506470400,4

115577,1108,1648,"While I haven't seen the film this song comes from, it's hard to deny that the song itself is a dang catchy tune.  And while not the most memorable song of the 80s, it has a nice instrumental accompaniment, a good singer, and a fun beat.  Great for fans of music of this decade, and it makes me curious about the film itself...",1506470400,4
115578,2916,20425,"I was already somewhat familiar with this beat. I must have heard another dance song with a similar sound, perhaps more than one. The energy level is less than that on ""Guilt"" or ""Promises"". I don't regret buying this song, but it's okay.",1506470400,3

115658,18270,4829,"Last month I found another classical music bargain at Amazon.com: Mozart: Complete String Quartets and Quintets on the VoxBox label. Featuring the Barchet Quartet, this is a very good MP3 album that contains over 10 hours of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozarts string quartets and quintets, all very artistically performed.

This MP3 VoxBox Edition contains all 23 of the string quartets in Mozarts oeuvre, plus all 6 of the string quintets he also composed. The works are placed in chronological order by their assigned K&ouml;chel (K) number, quartets first, followed by quintets. This allows listeners to hear the progression of Mozarts musical thinking and development over the years of composing in this genre.  Without question, each of these chamber works is a Mozartean masterpiece.

The Barchet Quartet was a German ensemble founded by violinist Reinhold Barchet. Other members of the ensemble were violinist Will Beh, violist Hermann Hirschfelder, and cellist Helmut Reimann. Violist Emil Kessinger joined the Barchets as a second viola for the string quintets. The musicianship of these players is generally excellent, although on occasion the violins sound a trifle over-bright, and display a bit more vibrato than my ears prefer. The audio quality is certainly crisp, clean, and precise, but the recordings thin string timbre and lack of fine detail make it obvious that these are older recordings that date from the 1950s and 1960s. However, this in no way detracts from my overall listening pleasure.

When Mozart: The Complete String Quartets and Quintets first came out at Amazon.com in 2014, it apparently sold for 99 cents  an extraordinary bargain. Now, even at nearly ten times that price ($9.49) I think it remains an excellent classical music value. With its low price, very fine performances, and good audio quality, it is certainly recommendable for any digital music library.",1506643200,4

Now that H-Town has become more acquainted with this artist you can now see that his music is being played locally and being received by a much larger audience. I give this 5 out of 5 best song by Tucka to this point IMO, not what I would say a cross over hit but a Southern Soul Hit and Future Classic.",1506816000,5

115790,7245,329,"I don't think there has been a more definitive example of ""fusion"" in music history as with Earth Wind & Fire.  Now I'm not talking Fusion like in Jazz (which by definition IS fusion, like in Fused On) no, I'm talking Jazz Funk Rhythm & Blues Afro-Latin Gumbo Rock!  Dig That Fusion Baby!  Artists like Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, The Temptations were producing progressive concept oriented albums that were catching the ears of listeners to the new progressive genres of Mahavishnu Orchestra, Santana, Traffic, Pink Floyd, Genesis, even Yes and ELP; and of course the progressive jazz of Creed Taylor's stable of jazz giants.  Earth Wind & Fire caught on quickly on campuses and their first two albums released on Warner Brothers' label (not represented here of course) got word of mouth disease, it was jazzy, funky, rock-drenched R&B and if you were an early acolyte to Chicago, this music was not a stretch at all, especially if you were also a fan of War, with or without Eric Burdon.

So this groovy 17-track single disc compendium of EARTH WIND & FIRE GREATEST HITS on the Columbia Legacy label is brilliantly engineered and sonically perfect for the fan who wants to light up their music collection with something essential.  The tracks are arranged in a rather organic order, not chronological but lending to a greater overarching feel of the evolution of their music.  Listen to Can't Hide Love and try not to think about ""smooth jazz"" a decade later, way ahead of its time, way!  This GH collection is pretty definitive and so well mastered it is the only 5 Star rated EWF album in the All Music Guide.  It contains all of The Best of Earth, Wind & Fire (1978) save the weakish Love Music, six of the 10 best from Best Of Volume 2, and has added the stupendous Kalimba Story (from Open Our Eyes, '74) and the title epic from Gratitude ('75).  Even if you have most of their studio releases, how can you live with yourself without the singles only September and Beatles cover Got To Get You Into My Life!

The CD comes with full music and track credits, a terrific bio (The Eternal Groove) by pop culture geek Mark Coleman and an intensely in-depth history (The Earth Wind & Fire Family Tree by Kevin Goins and Leo Sacks) all packaged with some beautiful artwork (always a staple of EWF albums).  Earth Wind & Fire were always a spiritually based group, full of positive vibrations and inner peace, Soul Food To Go as the Manhattan Transfer called it.  Get a heaping helping right here and you won't regret it.",1506902400,5

This song, although old, is still good and holds up without being too annoying even though it was a huge hit in the 90s. I just saw the video on MTV Classic and I just love her. She's so pretty in the video for this song. Natural beauty and talent. Like Mariah Carey (although I'm an even bigger fan of Mariah's). I wish Sheryl continued to make good music but these days I don't think that's really happening anymore although she had a new album earlier in April.

I miss her songs and wish dearly the quality of her tunes didn't peeter off. Sheryl is gold! One of my top 25 favorite artists probably. And that's saying something!

A poignant comment on disillusionment with the supposed sophistication of big city life. Not that it's never been said before, but never better than this.

A rousing start with Fox Hunt, the dead on jazzy arrangement of Chuck Mangione's The Legend of the One Eyed Sailor showed he was heading towards a a more jazz flavor sound most of the selections Alone aagain Naturally, A fast version of Up  Cherry Street and the beautiful Lani and  Herb vocals on Save the Sunlight and John Baez's  Dida are great but the slow draggy version of Burt Bacharachs I might frightenen her away from the bomb of a movie , Lost Horizon and the last  cut a A song for Herb  okay , but the previous mentioned slow and dragging, and the trumpet solos tired and weak. But this album featuring Quincy Jones arrangement Last Tango in Paris featured sensual sounding horn of Herb's that demonstrated Herb's ability to tackle this piece , very well.

116026,16366,19530,"This has become one of my favorite albums in the Prog/Rock genre! The music is intricate, beautiful, rhythmic, has great vocals (both male and female).

""

I highly recommend this album to all lovers of this genre and really hope that this supergroup stays together long enough to produce more wonderful albums!!!

116050,13446,2809,"Luther Vandross was and still is my all-time favorite singer, and this is a classic Christmas album that I have with his music. Whenever I play this Christmas album with Luther's music, it puts me in the Christmas spirit and it makes think about holiday season. I also have the real actual Christmas album by Luther  that came out back in 1995, and it's called ""This Is Christmas"". And I would sometimes play that album with Luther's music. This classic Christmas album has 14 tracks, and all the songs from the actual Christmas album by Luther is also from this classic Christmas album.

This classic Christmas album  has four other Christmas hits that I've never heard before from Luther, and those four other. Christmas hits are

""May Christmas Bring Happiness""

""At Christmas Time""

""The Christmas Song""

""Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas""
(live version)

The live version song ""Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas"" is a (duet with Chaka Chan), and it sounds pretty nice with them both singing together. And I do like the original version of that song with Luther singing by himself. Those other three Christmas hit songs from this classic Christmas album are also pretty good songs with Luther singing, and I do like them as well, especially ""The Christmas Song"". I find that one song from this album has a newer sound and it sounds alot different from the other two songs that I named with that song, and it also sounds similar to the other Christmas hit songs that I said was from the actual Christmas album ""This Is Christmas"" by Luther. Luther's Christmas music will always be heard around the holidays and with great memories, knowing that he's actually missed. And even though Luther is missed, he'll always be known and remembered as one of the greatest singers of all-time.",1507420800,4

116055,4098,20734,"Why is this CD so good? Well one of the greatest soundtrack artist, Craig Safan, composed it. Safan is especially good at adventures like John Williams. Safan made this great movie even better. I am a big fan of the 1980s movies. They were full of hope, light adventure, and a touch of comedy. I enjoy current movies too,  but I must admit they are mostly darker themes, with an apocalypse, zombies, foul language, and gore. So if you haven't seen this movie be sure to set aside some time for a rousing adventure in space. This reprint is excellent. Excellent quality CD, great price, fast delivery, well packaged, and reliable seller. I highly recommend getting this CD now. When this goes out of print it will double or triple in price. Being a fan of Remo Williams I had to pay more than double this price to get the reprint Remo Willams: The Adventure Begins CD because I waited to long.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Remo-Williams-The-Adventure-Begins/dp/B000EZ91EC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins</a>",1507420800,5

116089,12947,2221,"I think it's unfair as well as poor marketing by Amazon, that simply because it's available by purchasing the ""album only,"" that they don't even let you listen to samples. I do not believe this was the usual practice before ""Amazon Music"" came along. I'll bet good money that I can still sample the album on iTunes. You people need to pull your heads out of your collective asses as far as you are handling mp3 music. You're going to lose customers before all is said and done. There are plenty of other sites we can download our music from. Contrary to your beliefs--you have not cornered the market on downloadable digital music. Bad enough you still have a music application that hasn't worked properly since you ever updated the so-called music ap. Look at your own forums if you don't believe me.",1507507200,1

I like Simon & Garfunkel and saw the video on You Tube with over 1 million likes, so I thought I would add this song to my collection. This is another great song with lyrics that are on a different level than your average singer-songwriter.",1507507200,5

116142,7006,16890,This is a great arrangement of harmonies and chord patterns.  It starts out basically in another key and then goes into the song. The start is double track John and then Paul and John sing the verse in harmony throughout with Paul shooting up really high. They sang together in the recording session on one microphone.  This one was from Hard Day's Night. It's little known that the TV part of a Hard Day's night was shot at a real theater they rented and the music was done live in front of a live audience that was screaming and a very young Phil Collins was in the audience.,1507593600,5
116143,7006,17804,Another nice ditty this one featuring Paul on lead vocals with John and George on backgrounds. Again great chord patterns. The Beatles even back near the start were doing more than just three chord songs. Paul and George doing dual lead guitars. Again great reverb. John did a great job on the keyboard.,1507593600,5

That is because operas are set to words--and people, for all their faults and charm, like to know what is being said.

So along those lines ... 20 years later, when they release a new recording of an unknown opera and include everything but the libretto and translations, that is a big problem.",1507680000,2

I was slightly surprised while listening to some Irish music recently that a couple songs in the soundtrack sound similar to Irish songs. Listen to ""The Swallow Tail Jig"" in Digital music and ""This Kiss"" here and see if you think so too. The talent in making the music enhance the cinematography and action scenes is a unique talent that few composers achieve with such emotion and grandeur. This is one of the best music soundtracks I have ever heard in over sixty years of watching movies with some of the greatest composers of all time.",1507680000,5

Day starts to slowly dissolve into night and where one once began and the other now ends is no longer really relevant. The vision becomes strained, blurry or maybe even doubles, as you sit slumped in a semiconscious fog in front of the computer, at 4:36 a.m., randomly exploring YouTube music videos. (And, maybe the new Last Jedi trailer). And that my fine friend, is how I stumbled upon these five Finnish hillbillies, and their most excellent heartfelt & poignant bluegrass covers of classic rock tunes from days gone by.

116221,228,11618,"This is one of the better ""Late Performances""  from the brothers Van Halen.  The rising tempo and the heavy down beat are true examples of metal rock at its best. The drum work by Alex is nothing short of outstanding. It seems at time that he must have three arms to cram all of that sound into those rhythmic measures.  Of course Eddy is true to form with blazing guitar riffs that make you want to get up out of your seat and thrash something. Do not listen to this while driving on an empty road unless you don't mind speed. This is simply one of the best by some of the best.",1507766400,5

However after Holywood came out his albums became very hit or miss and dare I say boring. That changes with ""The Pale Emperor"" and he goes back to doing what he does best, making awesome music, that's extremely catchy. This album is a different beast from what has been released in the past, mainly due to the inclusion of more Blues Rock influences. It works really well and the entire album is easy to listen to from start to finish. Highlights for me include: ""Killing Strangers"", ""Deep Six"" and the great track ""Odds of Even"".",1507852800,5

Now after all these years, I finally tracked down the version I wanted-

I play this all time!  Now, it never gets old....

ZZ Ward has become one of my favorite recent artists! Looking forward to being able to purchase her newest album, as well! Not totally sure why it''s got the ""Explicit"" attached.

The whole heart of the band's sound is Gig Michaels great vocals and cover them up with the female vocals at some points and at other time exchange leads, ugh!  The new version of Fat Boy Can Jam is ruined.  If it was one duet on the album it wouldn't be bad, but there is way too much, it loses the Southern Rock feel.  Now the good news is if you are somewhat clever with a sound editor like Soundforge etc, you can pretty much edit out the bad parts and restore this album to greatness",1508025600,3

I feel this is a more sexualize album with the songs bad girl and playboy which are my favorites and most recognized songs from her. I love how this album is dance pop like a Paula Abdul, Vanessa Williams, and Janet Jackson vibe. Latoya vocals shows more sexiness like moaning, sighing, and sweet soft whisper voices. I feel bad girl and You're gonna get rocked. are her best albums. I love how she went from disco funk to dance pop, it suits her style.",1508025600,5

It used to be that people stayed together for life, but now many people go in and out of temporary lives. Karen Carpenter sang a song with this theme.  This I refer to is I Know I Need To Be In Love. Johnny Mathis recorded How Bout Us on his new album A Night To Remember and itis a good new version of the song by the group Champaign. I think these two versions of this classic song compliment each other and I encourage to you listen to both of them.

116361,18772,18802,"This clean version is pretty good background chill music. Won't cause one to pause while in a conversation, but has a decent party tempo as long as it isn't used for center stage entertainment. If one wants to wallow in anger, alienation, and self-pity then the explicit version will do you well, but all artistic value is lost in the explicit version with its overconcentration of, and obsession with, foul language.",1508112000,3

116367,16684,10776,"Now, this mp3 set of the complete harpsichord works of J.S.Bach doesn't actually have EVERYTHING, as his transcriptions of other composer's works are not included. Nor are any minor or perhaps spurious works. But pretty much everything else of consequence is included. It's a motherlode of music for the harpsichord by perhaps the greatest composer the instrument ever knew. Tons of great stuff, from the English and French Suites, to the Partitas and Toccatas, to both books of the Well-Tempered Clavier, to the Goldberg Variations and Inventions. My one quibble is that this music can get very repetitive very quickly. Of course, there is no way of playing dynamics on a harpsichord, so there is no real difference between soft and loud. Work after work can sound pretty much the same. Thank God Bach was such a stupendous genius!
  Martin Galling is a name that I'm not too familiar with, but he plays wonderfully, if a bit sewing-machine like at times. This is something the real Bach freaks will love. Moderate classical music listeners might like it too for it's immense size (over 15 hours says the label on the front). Glenn Gould fans should run away, run far away! But overall, I can't really say much more than: Recommended.---------------------------PEACE",1508198400,4

Miles Davis, Johnny Hartman, Sarah Vaughan, and Joe Williams.  His playing has always been notably strong for big horns, but sensitive enough for the subtlest singer.  In this set beautiful he's working with a quintet of sterling vocalists; Kurt Elling, Gregory Porter, Jane Monheit, Norah Jones and Alexis Cole, as well as his frequent collaborators - tenor sax player Eric Alexander, bassist John Webber, and drummer Joe Farnsworth.

I love Brandy and her vocals but other than a small handful of songs this album is kind of a joke. I don't like how Brandy made the move from Atlantic. Some of her songs suffered in turn. I'm definitely a fan of her though. I like all of her albums but this is her worst work to date (2017). There are some good songs but on a whole, this CD don't deliver. This is the only Brandy album I have that I kinda regret owning. ""Long Distance"", ""Right Here (Departed)"", ""1st & Love"" and ""True"" are the only songs I know I like on this album. That's not a lot. Too much filler I remember. Not a good look, Brandy. I wish she was still on Atlantic Records. That label helped create the amazing ""Never Say Never"", 2002's ""Full Moon"" and the underrated ""Afrodisiac"" which had tons of good Brandy tracks. When people say they like this album I can't agree with them. It's just Okay to me.

3.5 stars.

Seems that they are trying hard to be all of them.  For my tastes, I much prefer their country songs.  They do some nice light rock songs too and ""Kiss Goodbye""  flops back and forth between country and rock.  ""Shut Up Train"" is a nice country song and I wish they did more songs of this nature.  ""Why Oh Why"" is a good Southern Rock song that will get your juices flowing.",1508544000,4

I've enjoyed other albums by Teddy Thompson in the past, but this could be the best thing he's done yet. These two singers are a perfect musical fit.

But darn it, why couldn't they have given us an extra song or two? This is much too short. I still shudder at the thought of spending so much money for only 25 minutes of music. That makes this more an EP than a proper album. I shouldn't complain too loudly; the songs here are truly first-rate, but it's not exactly value for the money. Is there a reason that it's not being sold at a much cheaper price?",1508630400,4

That said, there are many other reasons I am sick of this group. What started out with kevin Moore on Images and Words was lost by the time they wrote, ""A change  of seasons"".It was a change in direction as they slowly put their religion into every album. Song after song about God, faith, salvation, repentance and yet Petrucci get's angry when people  call them a christian rock band. You are! Strange that Rush being your biggest so called influence are liberals and atheists, and you are a christian conservative that spoke on Youtube about your love for trump! That was enough for me to walk away from this band and their religious agenda. It seemed whe Portnoy left they felt embolden to push more religious songs on the people who made them rich!

116596,5777,15852,"I have been a die hard Beatles fan forever. There isn't too many things I can remember when I was 7 years old but I still remember watching The Ed Sullivan Show way back one Sunday night in February of 1964 when the Beatles appeared causing a sensation bringing Beatlemania from England across the Atlantic to the U.S. Their music was like nothing ever heard before and would influence songwriters and musicians to this day.

Their songbook seems to be endless from all the great hits they had during their time together. To try to list all their greatest songs would take too much time and space for this review. For me though even more time consuming would be trying to pick which is my favorite song by the Fab Four. Just too many outstanding tunes to choose from. Most times you could say my favorite Beatles song is whichever one of theirs I happen to be listening to at that moment. If on the other hand you were to ask me to come up with a top ten list of the Beatles best songs there is one song in particular that would in my book make it somewhere on that list, the song is ""Rain"". A really great Beatles song that is while a great one is little known and overlooked by many fans.

One reason is it never charted. It also never appeared on any of the Beatles albums. In fact it was released in 1966 as the B side to the Beatles hit single ""Paperback Writer"". This is however I feel a song that deserved to be the A side on any single. It has everything a great song needs insightful lyrics, great beat, great guitar work that combined grabs your attention.  This was recorded at the time the Beatles were transitioning their sound from the mop top ""She loves you yeah yeah yeah"" kind of music to being more experimental with their sound and creative with their words. For the true Beatles fanatic this is certainly one of their songs that has to be considered for download onto your iPod or smart phone.",1508716800,5

116609,14947,14679,"Originally released in 1982, George Winstons December has stood the test time. While there are some Christmas songs included, this isn't a holiday album, not exactly. In his prime as a pianist, Winston offers gentle and reflective takes on traditional songs like the The Holly and the Ivy and Carol of the Bells. He also presents unique and charming takes on Bach and Pachelbel. But where this album really shines is when Winston showcases his own compositions from Thanksgiving to Peace to three pieces that capture Night. Winston also offers a very memorable rendition of Alfred Burts Some Children See Him. The special edition has two extra songs including Burt's ""Sleep Baby Mine."" Its a reflective album, perfect for unwinding and relaxing in those moments when the rush of December with its shopping, noise and crowds.

She didn't have the overly sad ""I LOVE DA HELL OUTTA YOU/I MISS DA HELL OUTTA YOU"" songs that are a permanent staple in R&B today.  She sings her case and she moves on, leaving us wanting more.  Her writers KNOW what songs to present to Viv and she knows what her voice can handle.  Nothing overexaggerated or underdeveloped here.  Everything in it's musical place.  This is the PERFECT disc to pop in and get your chill factor on.

116661,7324,16369,"Fans are so fickle because they expect the super hit, but this record has good songs throughout (no bad ones).  They are returning to rock after a short jaunt into country that was not accepted.  They lost their name, and now they are trying to move into mainstream rock.  They have exceeded even some of their early albums that were hit oriented rather than quality.  Eventually this album will be recognized for the wonderful songs that never get old.  The band is recovering from the forces that would take them away from what they are good at, and I'm sure some of the band members also are questioning the direction they're going now.  Sometimes it's a step process, and this was a very good first step.  I've listened to these songs over and over, and only then do you appreciate the effort that went into making them.  Highly recommended for anyone who is coming to the 3 Doors the first time.",1508889600,5

I typically do not listen to music pre-80s unless it is a modern day cover, but with this one I started to actually like the original. Enter Leo's Cover. Something about it, I just can't stop listening to it. I just had to buy it, play it in my car, and play it at work. Whether you are a fan of the original or a fan of metal, I would recommend giving this cover a shot. I did and it won't leave my brain.",1509062400,5
116731,18800,14658,"I thought the original was weird, but Leo just takes this song in a whole new direction. I would recommend first watching the music video of the original, then listening to Leo's cover. You will then appreciate how he cracks his voice for the female lyrics. Keeping up with the speed of the original and the tone of its instruments, I would say that this is a great cover of his that although is totally different from the original, also comes as close to it as it can for the genre cover that is provided. If you haven't heard the original before or know the original artist, there is a reason this song is marked explicit.",1509062400,5

This remake (2010) with Sean Haynes and Kristin Chenoweth is fun and includes ""I Say a Little Prayer (for You),"" ""I'll Never Fall in Love Again,"" and the title song.

116910,11939,20783,"This is a very good recording of a 1978 concert in Chicago by one of the great singers and songwriters of our time backed by an electric band. A great mix of music that includes songs from Bruised Orange, John Prine (his first album), Sweet Revenge, and Storm Windows -- as well as a few surprises like the flip side of Elvis' 1957 Jailhouse Rock, and a 1964 Righteous Brothers blue-eyed soul hit.

September 78 is a high quality *authorized* recording released by John's own Oh Boy Records. It is unlike the unauthorized, only-in-it-for-the-money bootlegs released by others in the past few years that rip off John, and generally have terrible sound quality recorded from old radio broadcasts.

The sound quality of ""September 78"" is professional like 2010's ""In Person & On Stage"", 1997's ""Live on Tour"" (a personal favorite), and the historic ""The Singing Mailman Delivers"" recordings from 1970 and 1971.

Otherwise, the guys did a wonderful job of performing, not only before a live audience but it was being broadcast live in the located in Italy.

116957,7472,20784,"Cheap Xmas is a cleverly titled set that combines all of Fagan's previous solo albums and the bonus disc from the ""Nightfly Trilogy"" boxed set a from a decade ago. The mastering here is exactly the same as that previous set plus it has Fagan's fourth solo album. The main attraction is going to be disc five here with the b-sides, soundtrack songs, demos and live tracks.

Since the old of print ""Nightfly Trilogy"" is so expensive, this is the best way to get the bonus disc for a reasonable price. It would have been nice to see these remastered with high re discs but what we get here is a pretty good set. Unlike most of these reasonable boxed sets, this has the booklets for the first three albums included along with the cardboard holders for each. ""Sunken Condos"" includes the gatefold cardboard sleeve with the booklet. It's a nice boxed set (it sounds as if none of these have been re-mastered) and even the face of the CD looks the same as the garden variety individual releases.",1509494400,4

Ordered the CD to see if any of the audio was clearer.
There is a ""free"" recording of their act from Belgique which is
so much better than any CD.
I am now more impressed with the live recordings.

The CD is one of the poorer engineering jobs I have heard.
Sound is extremely ""tinny"" through my ADCOM GFA 1000 watt system
through Klipsch Towers.

The CD comes across like near Bootleg.

I will order the vinyl to see if there is a difference, any more warmth.",1509580800,3

117098,9343,3352,"British blues, which began to gather steam in the early '60s with Alexis Korner, John Mayall and others, reached a pinnacle in 1969 upon the release of LED ZEPPELIN II. The group's first album hadn't done much in the U.S., but a summer tour of the States as opening act for Chicago Transit Authority helped to greatly publicize this new offering. ""Whole Lotta Love"" was a megahit that autumn of '69, and it seems every high school and college-age kid was tuned in to Led Zeppelin from that point on.

LED ZEPPELIN II is one of those rare albums without a single weak track. Blues, heavy metal, hard rock-- there's something here for everybody. The term ""classic rock"" was invented for sets like this. Give it a listen, but be sure to say ""Thank You.""

These are played by the Hungarian pianist Jeno Jando, and I have become a fan of his because of this Beethoven set. I've read that he does the same thing that Glenn Gould did when he played: i.e. he hums. You can barely hear it on these recordings though, in case you were wondering. These were all recorded in Hungary back in the late '80's to the early '90's, when the collapse of the Iron Curtain brought freedom to Eastern Europe. The recordings are simple and not gussied up in any fancy kind of way. Because of this the lighter and shorter sonatas tend to come out better, while the bigger and heavier sonatas are still good but not great. This set will not diminish in the mind's eye the 2 greatest Beethoven pianists ever, Schnabel and Kempff, but it is still a must own for lovely-lovely-Ludwig-Van fanatics.

Rejoice these masterpieces of early soul have been wonderfully remastered and made available as limited run imports from Japan. Sylvers II happens to be my favorite ofthe trio  - those who have the ears in classic  hip hop will recognize many of the grooves. Buy it for the sheer youthful exuberance that is on display. Leon Sylvers was on full tilt creativity, his siblings in pitch perfect harmony, and with ""the legendary Ice Man Mr. Jerry Butler helming the project, the results are audio perfection. This should be required listening for any aspiring young star/ musician/producer/composer. Unfortunately this is a limited release and the prices have already begun to spike. I suggest ordering directly from the Amazon Japan site for a more affordable option. I urge you to get all three releases (Sylvers I,II,and III) and enjoy and treasure these.

117154,16001,3922,"It is astonishing to think that the Beatles recorded all the music on this 99:40 length double CD between late November 1966 and early April 1970, just a little over three years and four months.  As in the first compilation album, 1962-66, the listener can hear very clearly how their music evolves.  Short of having all the Beatles' albums from the period, 1967-70 is definitely the way to go, with music sampled from numerous singles, most of MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR and SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND, with three cuts from THE BEATLES (usually called ""the White Album""), four from ABBEY ROAD, and three from LET IT BE, all in chronological order.  Yes, there wasn't room for everything (I myself really miss ""Rocky Raccoon""), but it's a damn fine assortment nonetheless.  What's even more astonishing is that, even today, these songs don't sound a bit dated or quaint; the Beatles are just as rad as they ever were.

This is a great time to consolidate your old scratchy LP's from the Sixties, or to introduce a young friend to the glories of this group, which disbanded before any of them had turned 30.  Some trivia:  The Beatles: 1967-70 was released in the spring of 1973 and went straight to number one among albums.  The ""hairy Beatles"" photo on the cover was originally taken in 1969 and intended for a different album that didn't gel.  The ""Mop-Top Beatles"" photo on the cover of the 1962-66 compilation was taken in 1963, but not used as an album cover until that album was released ten years later.  It also appears on the inner gatefold here.

117175,7472,5370,"I'm going to miss Tom Petty. His melodic, honest, direct and intelligent brand of rock music seems to be fading away. These series of concerts recorded from the early 80's through 2008, are an excellent document of a working band. Petty and The Heartbreakers are all in top form here.

I was at one of the shows that was included here (it was Tom Petty's week long residency at the Fillmore) and the atmosphere can positively be felt as the band's music rumbles throughout the speakers. The CDs are housed in cardboard sleeves with the songs listed on the back. All of these come in a nicely designed cardboard box and includes a booklet with comments from the late Petty about the concerts.

This is a nice summary of the band's live performances similar to Springsteen's boxed set released back in 1984 but, for me, this works so much better (and it is less expensive as well continuing to show Petty's commitment to not ripping off his fans).",1510099200,5

117195,17668,11079,"I am an ardent fan of Two Steps from Hell and always figured they were the best and all others were inferior (even though I hardly gave other groups a chance). I recently decided to give Audiomachine ""Life"" a chance. I enjoyed several of the pieces. But I knew that was a lighter album and wanted to hear something that represented Audiomachine's more characteristic style and sound. I randomly chose Magnus this morning and have been listening to to most of the day. All I can say is I am amazed how good the music. I feel silly for waiting so long to try them out. Some of the pieces that really stand out to me as captivating and amazing at this point include Frozen Synapse, When it all Falls Down, Being Alive, Red October...these are the ones I appreciate so much just after one day. If you like epic music such as Two Steps from Hell, don't be a noob like me, buy this album.

Edit: after listening for about a week I can say there are no duds on this album, every piece is exceptionally good and captivating. I cannot believe I waited so long to check out Audiomachine. Buy now. Bye now!",1510185600,5

On the first studio album without Henry Paul, new lead guitarist-singer-songwriter Freddie Salem adds some hard rock riffs, which blend well with Hughie Thomasson's lightning country-blues-rock leads and Billy Jones' unique wide vibrato. The interplay among the three lead guitars and drummers Monte Yoho and David Dix is put to great use on several of the albums songs, and everything here is great- even ""Dirty City"", which shows the band moving into a funk realm, is enjoyable, though you might think it's another band entirely. Moreover, producer Mutt Lange, who later overdid things with Def Leppard, smooths out the band's sound here without smothering it. Overall, PLAYIN' TO WIN is yet another great, if different, Outlaws CD.",1510272000,5

Jeffrey Biegel, an American concert pianist, performs each of Mozarts piano sonatas with incomparable artistry. His interpretations of Mozarts music are simply exquisite in every way, and the audio quality of this MP3 album is among the best of any of the Big Box purchases I have made in the past few months.

Mozart: Big Piano Sonatas Box is a winner in every way. I think it ranks as one of the very best albums from The Bach Guild. At only 99 cents, this is an unbeatable bargain, and a must-own for anyone who enjoys the music of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Most highly recommended.",1510272000,5

117322,1402,11895,"It consisted of one verse and one chorus. The other 14 minutes were a jam featuring an organ solo by Doug Ingle, a guitar solo by Erik Brann and a drum solo by Ron Bushy. Bassist Lee Dorman got half a duet with Ingle, but Bushy proved with his drum solo that you can get away with repeating ""Shave and a Haircut, Six Bits"" for a long time. As long as you dress it up with enough effects pedals. He got half a duet with Ingle too--a fantasia built on (would you believe) ""God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen"". So when Atco edited out everything but the vocal section, you got three reps each of the verse and refrain. So it didn't make much of a single. Be warned--you're better off with the album.",1510444800,2

117368,18270,16904,"Big Chamber Music Box, Volume 1 is the first of three chamber music Big Box MP3 albums from The Bach Guild. It contains chamber music works from various composers of the romantic period of classical music, including: Antonin Dvorak, Anton Bruckner, Franz Schubert, Alexander Borodin, and Johannes Brahms.

Although I am somewhat less familiar with these composers chamber works than I am with those of J.S. Bach, Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven, I am very impressed with the selections that appear on this album. I think my favorite is Cypresses, a twelve-movement chamber work by Dvorak thats performed to perfection by The Cleveland Quartet. I also find the Violin Sonata in A Major and Piano Quintet in A Major by Schubert to be especially enjoyable.

As is the case with every Big Box MP3 album I have purchased thus far, the audio quality of Big Chamber Music Box, Volume 1 is excellent. This album is a winner in every way, and at only 99 cents, its an unbeatable bargain that belongs in the digital music library of anyone who appreciates classical chamber music Highly recommended.",1510531200,5

This song was played a lot on the TV series Saturday Night Love years ago when Will Ferrell and Chris Kattan played on that show for years, and this was a long time ago starting in 1998. Those two comics played as brothers who would go to a nightclub and try to pick up girls and they wanted to dance with them. Of course they didn't know how to dance and it was really funny. But I loved this song the first time I heard it. A movie was made also ""A Night At The Roxbury"" was the nightclub place that played this song; and Will Ferrell and Kris Kattan starred in the movie playing as brothers and they would go to the nightclub every weekend.

117447,4046,16514,"Review no. 135. Show recorded live on May 12, 2016 at the Royal Albert Hall. Didn't recognize a few of the Iggy Pop tunes that show up on this live 2-CD / DVD title. Turns out that the tracks played at this gig are from the Igster's 'Lust For Life' ('77), 'The Idiot' ('77) and obviously his most recent work 'Post Pop Depression' ('16). Tunes I got the most out of were the previously mentioned ass-kicking ""Lust For Life"", ""Sister Midnight"", ""Funtime"", the awesome ""Nightclubbing"", the very recognizable ""The Passenger"" and ""China Girl"". Not to mention some material off the newest CD - like ""Gardeia"", ""Chocolate Drops"" and ""Paraguay"". Only downside here - maybe for some - is that I didn't see any Stooges classics covered. That's okay - it's all good just the same. The DVD has the very same track listing as the two audio CD's. Highly recommended.",1510704000,5

117538,18270,17170,"Big Chamber Music Box, Volume 2"" is the second of three chamber music Big Box MP3 albums from The Bach Guild. It contains chamber music works from various composers of the romantic period of classical music, including (among others): Ernst von Dohn&aacute;nyi, Claude Debussy, Darius Milhaud, Alban Berg, Maurice Ravel, and Charles Gounod.

Although I am somewhat less familiar with these composers chamber works than I am with those of J.S. Bach, Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven, I am very impressed with the selections that appear on this album. I think my favorites are Milhauds Petite Symphony No. 3 as performed by the Sinfonia Orchestra with Barry Faldner, and Dohn&aacute;nyis Piano Quintet No. 1 in C minor by The Cleveland Quartet with Barry Snyder. I also find the Debussys Sonata for Flute, Viola, and Harp to be especially enjoyable.

As is the case with every Big Box MP3 album I have purchased thus far, the audio quality of Big Chamber Music Box, Volume 2 is excellent. This album is a clear winner, and at only 99 cents, its an unbeatable bargain. Highly recommended.",1510876800,5

117553,16684,8112,"Many people thought that Bob Dylan's album Christmas in the Heart must have been some kind of sick holiday joke back in 2009, but I think it has held up well in the years since. This is one of the more offbeat, but finest holiday albums released in the past 20 to 25 years. And as the years (and Christmases) go by, it seems more and more that this is the Christmas seed from which all of Dylan's recent ""great American songbook"" albums have sprung from. This album was meant to echo the classic, old-time Xmas songs of way back when. Like Sinatra, Doris Day, Bing Crosby, Burl Ives and company. The arrangements and production values reflect that. Yes, Bob's voice is ragged, creakly, sandpapery and rough, but you get a feeling that he puts new life into these songs which can seem tired at best in the hands of another singer. And you feel that he truly believes the sentiments expressed in these songs, something very rare in today's Xmas albums. Another trick of the trade that Bob (and perhaps everybody) knows: just like the late great Leonard Cohen, Bob uses sweet female voices to be the sugar on his sometimes hard to get vocals. The backup singers here remind me of the Andrews Sisters. The point is that this album works.
  Highlights include Here Comes Santa Claus, I'll Be Home for Christmas, Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas, The Christmas Song and more. I'd never heard the song Christmas Island before, but now I have to rank it among my favorite Xmas songs. It's cute and kitschy. This album is recommended for Dylan fans, Xmas album nuts, and those who grow a bit tired of the holiday fare on Lite FM. It's also a wonderful primer for those who wish to get into (or try to appreciate) Dylan's more recent standards albums, Shadows in the Night, Fallen Angels and Triplicate. All in all a nice recommendation. Happy (very early) Holidays!------------------------------PEACE
BTW-The one bad song was Must Be Santa. Dylan doing a polka??!!",1510876800,4

117563,56,244,"It is always sad whenever someone young and talented dies at a early age. For this, it was a deviating shocker. Hearing about the tragic death of Malcolm Young, one of the musical virtuosos of AC/DC, was just a devastating shock. Hard to believe he passed away after leaving the group 3 years ago, and privately battling with dementia that crippled him. Now with his death, he joins his musical brother Bon Scott, who died over 35 years ago, after he had long-fronted the group. But with Brian Johnson taking the helm, AC/DC hit their commercial peak with Back In Black. Through that album, AC/DC had a lot of great songs through that album. But nevertheless, the group had a lot of wonderful anthems, and You Shook Me All Night Long remains one of AC/DC's finest. The song is a real feel-good boogie rhythm that still ignites today from the heart and soul of the music. Whenever I hear this year, I think of all the joy AC/Dc brought to a mass appeal that no rock group had ever been able to do before. Now, with Malcolm Young passing on, his legacy is enshrined with some of guitar's greatest heroes like Jimi Hendrix and Chicago's Terry Kath and B.B. King. May Malcolm Young be forever remembered, shaking us all night long.

I was not prepared for how good this is.  The best representation of Check Leavell-era Allman Brothers that I have heard yet.
Yes, you still get Gregg growling through songs like Trouble No More, Stormy Monday, and One Way Out. You get the Dickey Betts classics Blue Sky, Elizabeth Reed, and Jessica. You also get an all-instrumental Whipping Post, featuring Jerry Garcia, as well as a version of the classic Hideaway, which I don't think I've ever heard from the Brothers before. Plus, lots of blues jamming, particularly on the 3rd and 4th disks. Did I mention that Boz Scaggs drops in to sing a couple of tunes ?
In addition, the sound is fine for a radio broadcast.

117610,18270,17519,"Big Chamber Music Box, Volume 3 is the third of three chamber music Big Box MP3 albums from The Bach Guild. It contains chamber music works from various composers of the classical and early romantic periods of classical music, including (among others): Joseph Haydn, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven, Franz Schubert, Giacchino Rossini, and Luigi Boccherini.

I am much more familiar with most of these composers chamber works than I am with those featured on Big Chamber Music Box Volumes 1 and 2  (both of which I have reviewed here at Amazon.com).  My expectations for the music on this third volume were therefore very high, and I am pleased to report that the music in no way disappointed. Indeed, I am very favorably impressed with both the selections that appear on this album, and the quality of the performances. My favorites include Haydns Quartet for Guitar and Strings in D major; Beethovens Duo for Clarinet and Bassoon in C major; and, of course, Mozarts incomparable Serenade for Winds in B flat major Gran Partita.  I also find Boccherinis Quintet for Guitar and Strings in E major to be especially enjoyable.

As is the case with every Big Box MP3 album I have purchased thus far, the audio quality of Big Chamber Music Box, Volume 3 is excellent. This is a clear winner that I think is hands-down the best of the three Big Chamber Music Box volumes from The Bach Guild. At only 99 cents, its also an unbeatable bargain that deserves a place in every classical music collectors digital library. Most highly recommended.",1511049600,5

117674,56,7191,"Utmost, it is honestly very sad whenever someone who has a gift, throws it away and passes on. That is sadly the case with David Cassidy. After all of the stardom and success in The Partridge Family, he passed away from a broken heart, after his years of battling drug and alcohol addiction, bankruptcy and numerous failed marriages with failing as a father to his children. It is no surprise to me, just like other child stars whom had died early with their deep wounds like Dana Plato & Gary Coleman from Different Strokes that also died from the same, damaged heart. One song that I will always remember of David's from The Partridge Family is really his signature track from the show, I Think I Love You. The song really is a trip back in time to when music and harmony was innocent in the 70's, with so much strife in the world and the beginning off the peace movements of the generation. David really was a blessing at the end, but could have been more if he was on the right path, and not with one that had so much wounds at the end. He will be missed at the innocence that David was.

117685,11,60,"No REALLY, I'm serious. My wife doesn't get it. My friends don't get it. My family doesn't get it. But I think some other people who listened to and love this CD get it. This is not just another album. Taylor Swift, somewhere along the line, went from just another Country Music Generic Girl to a song-writing GENIUS. Maybe she grew up. Maybe she got her 10 years/10,000 hours ala Mozart. I don't know. But all I know is something CHANGED in that woman. Her music was good before. Not mostly my cup of tea (except a few songs from Fearless), but good. Then I heard snippets from some of the songs in Red in various commercials for Cola and Stores. I got curious. I decided to check out at the album at my local library...

OMG

Yeah, yeah. Young kids love Taylor Swift. My hipster friends like to make fun of her. I'm a 36-year-old male. Not my demographic. Blah, blah, blah. I mostly listen to video game music, film scores, and orchestral recording. When I DO listen to music with lyrics I like to listen to every kind of music under the sun (country, pop, easy-listening, classic rock, 80's, 90's, metal, joke albums, folk music, etc). So when I say that music is genius, I'm saying this after a lifetime of love of every kind of music from classical to broadway to radio. And this album is undoubtedly genius.

Every song...EVERY SONG

Let's be honest. Most albums released have one or two great songs that deserve to be hits, and the rest are kinda forgettable. Rare is the album that you want to put in your cd player or record player and listen to beginning to end (which is why retro records are such a huge deal these days IMO; people like the old albums that told a great story over the course of an album). But boy is this ever an album to listen to all-the-way through. The beat, rhythm, pacing, lyrics, vocals, instrumentation, is just...perfect is not the word. These songs are written, performed, and perfected by a GENIUS. Yeah, yeah. Auto-tune is a thing. Voices can be adjusted in the studio to improve them. So....what? The end product is what matters on an album, and the end product here is extraordinary.

You see all the influences here. Some of the songs are reminiscent of U2, Mandy Moore, Michelle Branch, Cher, and all your favorite Pop music. But there's a quickness, a flexibility, and vivacious enthusiasm and genuine emotion that is Taylor Swift, and it is straining to escape in every track, like she's got something she desperately needs to tell you and can barely hold it in. Perhaps that's why I love this album so much. I have Aspergers. I can't feel empathy from people around me in the real world. So I love ""anvil-dropping"" emotion. I love to know clearly and obviously how someone feels (in a video game, a TV show, a movie, a book, and especially in music). And in this album Taylor wears her emotions on her sleeve and the melodrama is glorious. And the lyrics are brilliant.

I don't know about you, but I'm feeling 22

I cannot for the life of me understand why my wife and her friends do not love the song ""22"" to death, except perhaps as Taylor is very much aware, it's ""cool"" to hate her, and hipster music ""is so much cooler than me"". To that, all I can say is...it's not easy to be number 1. It's not easy to be at the top of the world (only place to do is down). As Dale Carnegie pointed out in his books, all the other kids want to ""kick the king"" (true story). And in my mind's eye I can imagine Taylor Swift walking off stage at a massive concert full of screaming fans and having a sobbing breakdown like the gold medalist from the film ""Chariots of Fire"" when another competitor says ""what's wrong with him?"" and a man replies ""It's a terrible thing to win. Hope you never have to experience it.""

Yes, Taylor is well-aware that she's loved and hated. And uses it to add fuel to her creative fire. And with ""22"" she used it to create the anthem of a generation. That's not the only case of brilliant lyrics, but it is perhaps the most obvious. Her lyrics are like poems. And they are GOOD.

Is this Taylor Swift's Greatest Album? I don't know. Maybe. It fuses country/pop/and R&B rhythms better than any of her other albums, which went more in the pop/rap/ballad direction. But it is definitely worth owning, on a number of levels. It's a milestone in terms of country/pop fusion. It's one of Taylor Swift's best albums, and it marks in my mind the turning point where her music went from good to BRILLIANT. Buy it. Ya know, unless Taylor Swift's annoying voice and ""uncoolness"" is too much for you. Whatever.",1511481600,5

117733,1672,2958,"I pulled this CD out of my shelf the other day and the songs were just as good as I remembered from when I purchased this back in 2010. Songs such as ""Do you Love Me"", better than the Contours version and the best version I've heard, ""Glad All Over"", ""Bits and Pieces"", ""Can't you See That She's Mine"", both songs titled ""Everybody Knows"", ""Catch Us If you Can"", ""I Like It Like That"", ""Because"" and the previously unreleased ""Universal Love"", which has the same corde progression as Marmalade's ""Reflections Of My Life"". Also loved the lowd haunting ""Ninteen Days"", a nice blues rock song about being lonely. ""Everybody Knows (We're Through"" was covered by Engelbert Humperdinck and both versions are great. Sadly I got rid of the imbossed outer box to this package. I happily have the 28 page booklet included, but I am not fond of the liner notes here because it makes Dave Clark sound very selfish. It only mentions stuff about him and no other band members. I was expecting that to happen as he is a really greedy selfish man who always resists the chance to keep his albums available on CD. When he passes away, there is a better chance of more CD reissues as the masters will be lisenced to his family and maybe we'll see them on CD in the future. I don't really want to say this, but hurry up, Dave and die! so your fantastic music becomes available forever on CD.",1511654400,5

117990,4844,8884,"Five MARVELOUS Stars. From the album The Best of Spanky & Our Gang, 20th Century Masters, The Millennium Collection, this is the short-lived, so-called sunshine pop vocal and instrumental group, Spanky & Our Gang performing their lovely, swinging performance of their classic hit song, Like To Get To Know You that continues to get lots of airplay by the oldies but goodies radio stations. The group was led by Elaine Spanky McFarlane whose sultry, attractive, distinctive voice gave the group its unique vocal sound. The Our Gang septet members were: Malcolm Hale, Nigel Pickering, Paul Oz Bach, John Seiter, Kenny Hodges, and Lefty Baker, all on vocals, plus Max Bennett on bass, Larry Knechtel on piano, Mike Deasy on guitar, and Hal Blaine on drums, and an 11 piece string section. Unfortunately, arranger/guitarist Malcolm Hale died in an accident and the group chose to not go on without him in 1969. But their marvelous music, which transcends musical genres, has been re-packaged several time in re-issues and is thankfully available in the digital MP3 era. This one song alone shows they were already talented artists who could mix genres in creating highly-attractive vocal and instrumentally rhythmic music

The song Like To Get To Know You was written by producer Stuart Scharf and is about the search for love. Arranger Hale creates a marvelous shifting musical setting combining rock, latin, jazz, and classical musical devices. It is actually built on a subtle latin beat and uses an advanced musical pedal point that can be repeated endlessly if desired: a form that jazz men Ahmad Jamal, Miles Davis, and John Coltrane used to great advantage as modal music. Legendary drummer Blaine, the most recorded drummer in recording history, whips up a subtle storm behind the group throughout the performance.

The song Like To Get To Know You is a favorite that is begins with an attractive buoyant drum beat, violins, and a comping piano over drum rimshots. The song is build on the infectious repetition of call-response lyrics like Id like to get to know you', (""yes I would""): ""Id like to get to know you"", (""if I could) and so on. The male members and Spanky trade lyrics until Spanky enters alone on the bridge with a sassy delivery which continues on with the main lyric and the refrain. Then suddenly comes a lovely, idyllic interlude with ethereal echoes, strings, and guitars which sets the stage for a pretty vocal coda that includes the male voices and Spankys voice in another call-response phase that vamps to the fadeout. Produced by Stuart Scharf. What a marvelous performance and a feat of studio engineering! My Highest Recommendation. Five APPEALING Stars. (Island Mercury records. 1-MP3 track. Time-3:18.)",1512259200,5

Sky Saxon and his band were the essence of rock and roll: the minimal writing skills, the minimal musical skills, the maximum soul. Just goes to show everyone who ever wanted to plug in a guitar that what it takes to make great rock and roll is the belief that your three chords are the best to offer the world. ""Pushing Too Hard"" is timeless, but so are all the other songs (many of which sound a lot like ""Pushing Too Hard."") There's a real sense of what sound filled basements and garages in the wake of Beatlemania, but in stead of Paul cooing ""PS I Love You,"" The Seeds were embracing the death of the American Dream and the birth of rock and roll.

It is breathtaking.  I wish I could have gone to your concert.  Every time I put this record on a big smile appears across my face.  When are you going to make another worship moment like this?  Do you read these comments?  I am such a fan of these sounds, and also I am loyal to God. You have helped me so much.  This album is my biggest help through the Glories of God.  All I can say is I wish this music lasted for 3 more hours.",1512432000,5

118085,6684,10918,"Another superb album by Arcade Fire. ""The Suburbs"" won best album of the year at the Grammy's a few years ago and I 100% agree. I enjoy every song, even ""Rococo"" (strange lyrics but awesome music). Win Butler has a great voice, it's full of emotion and melody. How can you not feel something on tracks like: ""Modern Man"", ""We Used to Wait, ""Deep Blue,"", ""Ready to Start"", and the title track? The answer is, you can't. He has this special, rare quality to his music that you can't fake or manufacture. Beautiful album by a beautiful band. ""The Suburbs"" is a meaningful and unforgettable album. I listen to it all the time. And I don't care what people say, I also like their latest album, ""Everything Now"". I appreciate that the band are not afraid to change up their sound with each studio album. So with that being said, I recommend ALL 5 of their studio albums, but start with ""The Suburbs"" - it's their most groundbreaking. Enjoy!",1512432000,5

This is such a beautiful album, Im totally in love with all 12 songs on this album. The lyrics and most definitely Chester Benningtons angelic voice full of every human emotion you could imagine all wrapped into one sound.... R.I.P Chester - Truly, a blessing to this world. I certainly know the last almost 18 years of falling in love with Linkin Park and the many avenues Chester went into; Its been a huge chunk of my life that Chester's screaming and beautiful voice healed me in my sincerely most darkest days.. and still going..  If you are a sincere fan of LP - and Chester Benningtons blessed voice - YOU MUST HAVE THIS AND LISTEN ALL RIGHT AWAY!!!!

Boy this Amazon company can be a real crapshoot when trying to get your hands on twice baked potato accessories and surgical hose. Ghostlights is the best album Tobias Sammet has released in the span between Edguy's Space Police and Edguy's Monuments. The songs all have music and words or at least one or the other.

118326,18850,20848,"As much as I love George Harrison, this is one of his worst albums.  He had damaged his vocals while touring and was being criticized for adding Krishna lyrics to his Beatles classics. His creative funk had also crept into the recording studio when making this album. ""Ding Dong,"" ""Simply Shady,"" and ""Dark Horse"" are his strongest tracks. Others may like ""Far East Man,"" which he co-wrote with Ron Wood. But Harrison's odd cover of the Everly Brothers ""Bye Bye Love"" is difficult to like. In fact, it sounds like a warped vinyl record playing on a cheap turntable. Overall, the album sounds like Harrison was trying to distance himself from his Beatles legacy but didn't quite know which direction to take it. Dark Horse isn't a terrible album. Harrison fans like myself own it...but would a Harrison fan recommend it to another person less familiar with his work? Probably not without a disclaimer.",1513296000,3

And in addition to that without a doubt, Billy Squier's "" Christmas is The Time to Say 'I Love You',"" is a blast from the 1980s MTV past.  While listening to an unforgettable song, especially, if one remembers the music video that accompanied it -- captures the sights and sounds of the era that is now one of a kind.

118365,17184,2880,"This is more of a 4.25 star album (yes, I'm getting nit-picky here).  I love Two Steps from Hell, and Thomas Bergersen's previous album ""Illusions"" was magnificent (10 stars for that one).  This one sounded better in the 30-sec previews; I found it has a very tribal quality (due to the vocals) upon listening to the tracks all the way through.  It's in my writing playlist rotation, as I don't think it's a bad album...it's just not quite what I was expecting.  Still, it's grown on me the more I've listened to it - one of those cases of familiarity breeding enjoyment.  I don't regret my purchase; this is one I might have delayed, however, if I'd had the forethought to listen to it on YouTube.  While ""Illusions"" remains a masterful work with infinite replay value, ""Sun"" is more a mood thing and one I don't find myself reaching to play as often.",1513382400,4

118395,4899,2807,"The basic dynamic cycle of let me go crazy on you fits the social hysteria of escape from shambolic psychopathology into an individual clinging sensation that might account for the phases of political questions in the breakdown of economic systems, mega-death wars, cult magic, and institutional thinking based on polygamy in monoculture power structures with moral police cash confiscation.

A long, storied career and one of the most recognizable voices of all time. You know what you are getting from a James Taylor album. Nice, smooth, relaxing music.

118702,7955,18466,"Oh. Silly me. I thought I was getting MUSIC. Not SOUND EFFECTS. And certainly not the SAME sound effect, sustained so as to turn it into an hour-long recording. Aren't there any controls on Max Corbacho's synthesizer, or is it a cheap one that only comes with one pre-determined setting?

Sound effects are interesting for a few seconds--longer if you're heavily stoned I suppose. But this is the most profoundly dull, boring, mind-numbing ""music"" I've ever heard. If you're not already brain-damaged from whatever drugs induced you to buy this dog of a CD, you will be after listening. Mozart it ain't. Mozart, as is known, can help develop the brains of infants, and even adults. This CD works in reverse, turning your brain to a mass of useless putty within minutes. I'm surprised I still know how to type on a keyboard.

Max, learn what a key signature is. Learn how to produce more than one note. Then you may find you've discovered something called ""music."" Anyway, don't do this again (oops.......too late).

118757,56,15326,"Hard to believe that today marks the 2nd anniversary since the tragic death of Natalie Cole. Musically, she was one of the most soulful R&B songstresses in the world. Yet, in the way Natalie was remembered at the end, was actually by so many people remembering Natalie from the problems she had endeavored back in the 70's and early 80's, from bankruptcy and addiction. Sadly, that is disgusting to her legacy, and the everlasting memory of her beloved father, Nat King Cole. There are so many songs she had soulfully graced our hearts with for 40 years of pop music. Natalie Cole will always be remembered so many great songs, but her debut hit, Everlasting Love, will always be the one people will go to for the first glimpse. The song is just a joyous and soulful rhythm that still shows beauty and soul from the heart. today, the song has been the signature opus, for eHarmony. It is one my favorite songs that Natalie Cole will forever be remembered for, and a real treat for anyone who has never even heard a glimpse of her unforgettable voice.

This ""departure"" CODA struck all the right chords with me concerning the passing of a stellar mostly lately under-rated artist. More young people and typical modern"" country"" and/or ""rock and rollers"" need to check out Glen's history and learn from a master. The man was an innovator and a foundation stone of American popular music. I remember watching the Glenn Campbell hour back in the 60s-70s and he always had the coolest acts, so it brought our family together in front of the TV on those nights.  9 times out of 10 my mostly traditional country music DAD would give a nod of approval to what we were listening to, simply because Glen had them on his show, that was a HUGE stamp of approval. Let me just ask you, what music program of the modern era (right now) brings families together like this? This was way before MTV so we didn't suffer from lack of video of our favorite up and coming artists in those days, thanks to Glen's vision. NO he is not a relation to me (that I am aware of) but every CAMPBELL in this family is proud and always loved Glen and not just for his name.

118819,10941,17870,"THE SHELTERS self-titled debut rocks!!!  Anybody remember what that means?!!  It's straight-up American rock.  No shouting of lyrics, a la Dave Grohl, Foo Fighters.  These songs are actual melodies with harmony, sung by a terrific band, who play, rather than ""wear"" guitars, drums, write their own music & sound both experienced yet entirely fresh & new....what a concept for music & music lovers to love!  And, you will LOVE everything about THE SHELTERS!!!  I, myself, discovered them on ""Last Call With Carson Daly"" - thank you, Carson, for still providing us with impressive new musical artists!!

I understand Tom Petty (R.I.P.) discovered these guys in L.A. & what better Stamp of Approval could anyone in music desire?!!  He lent them the use of his studio & left them to it to create & THE SHELTERS do not disappoint!!!  Certainly, there are influences heard & that's a good thing.  The beginning chords of 1st track & single ""REBEL HEART"" recall very early Beatles and the song also brings to (my) mind The Rembrandts Theme Song To (T.V. show) Friends, ""I'll Be There For You"", but more rock, less pop!  - Make no mistake, this is genuinely authentic ROCK!! The guitars on ""Never Look Behind Ya"" recall a more recent band, The Black Keys.  The opening chords on ""Liar"" are reminiscent of Cream's ""Sunshine Of Your Love"", but then takes off in its' own really rockin' direction!!  Biggest rocker on CD & my #1 favorite!!  Some songs, though relatively few, considering...have a faint whisper of Tom Petty (particularly Track #2 ""Birdwatching"" & Track #9, ""Gold""), but no influences heard here will hit you over the head; it's much more subtle - more like a light flavoring, rather than a dollop of gravy!!

All tracks Winners, no Fillers!  Additional noteworthy favorites including ""Birdwatching"" & ""Liar"" are all 4 opening tracks wherein Track #1 is the phenomenal ""Rebel Heart"" & Track #9 ""Fortune Teller!!  Anyone who's been lamenting the death of rock 'n roll should immediately buy this, support this band & ROCK!!",1514851200,5

Upbeat without being overly saccharine, it has a nice blend of piano accompaniment and wistful but still upbeat lyrics.

118873,10135,20550,"After picking up BMTHs 2004-2013 compilation album (admittedly by accident, mistaking this band for another long-named band) I decided to gamble on downloading Thats The Spirit after being pleasantly surprised with the change in direction in BMTHs sound - especially with the Sempiternal album. The tracks from Sempiternal on the compilation made me an instant fanboy for the moment, as I found the elements of their sound with atmospheric, layered keyboards/programming meshed with clean vocals all very fascinating.  So I gambled on purchasing Thats The Spirit but so far Ive found it to be underwhelming compared to what Ive previously heard from BMTH.  At times the material on TTS gets too soft and poppy for my liking. The stronger tracks for me are: Doomed, Happy Song, and Throne. Beyond those I feel like Im listening to songs comparable in sound to Ed Sheeran or Justin Bieber. But then again maybe a veteran metal head like myself isn't supposed to be within their niche market. Its okay if Im not. For me the thrill was fun for while it lasted.",1514937600,3

I played it to death. Thanks Dad. RIP. Bought this album on a whim. Walk Away Rene also a classic. Havent heard these 2 songs in years. Great era musically to grow up in. So creative less commercial. Love the 2 songs as much as ever. Worth the price of the album alone. My issue is that it should be remastered.,1515024000,5

119028,2613,8116,"I love this song! It came out a couple of months before I finally had enough money from my first job after college to buy a 35mm SLR Minolta camera in 1973.  I only wished later that I had waited one more month so I could have gotten the next model up with the hot shoe for the flash (say wha? What's a hot shoe, man?).  What a beat this song has! What a hook this song has! Mama did not take Paul's Kodachrome away (the absolute best and truest color rendering slide film there ever was even though it was the most expensive and slowest ASA speed).  Kodak itself took it away after the digital camera appeared on the scene. Sigh. I upgraded the Minolta camera to another film camera in the mid 80s. I still do not like digital cameras. Have you ever used one between 9 am and 4 pm in the desert on a day with NO clouds? Or outside anywhere during a bright day when there are NO clouds? The LCD viewing screen cannot handle that sun! The LCD screen one the camera I have now is difficult to see in sunlight. The screen on my cellphone is difficult to see in sunlight. Give me back my viewer if you can't give me back my Kodachrome!",1515283200,5

You may have heard this track on a Samsung vs. iPhone commercial. The track playing on the Samsung commercial and this track (on Amazon) are remastered versions however, they still sound great. If anyone has ever suffered through a hardship with a partner who just can't-get-right, or had a friendship turn sour -this is the perfect song.

119053,17011,8174,"Along with the Mass in b and the Passions, the Christmas Oratorio deserves to be one of Bach's best works. It demonstrates to me how intelligent he was musically in putting a piece (any piece of any genre) together, using particular instruments to add sensitivity and color. And so, 150 minutes go by with not one of boredom. Moreover, hardly any baroque composer can make you weep as Bach does.
I am writing this because, after reading other reviews (some of which, sorry, are so absurd as to deem them inappropriate -- check the one star with the comment!) I have to strongly disagree with the appreciation of the solo singing. For that, I suppose you have to hear other versions; even the old ones fare better there. Specifically, I could barely stand the 'alto' of Michael Chance. He was not in good voice here. The high notes are dry and the lows cannot be controlled very well (I was screaming for a Janet Baker to appear). And: I DO NOT dislike countertenors, mind you. Pity. Maybe we have been spoiled in the last thirty years with outstanding countertenors?
I did not find much outstanding in the other singers, Kooy (the bass) and Crook (the tenor) are solid and Schlick left me cold (this time). Given the year (1989) they were possibly starting their long Bach career and did better afterwards (as my vast Bach cantata collection shows).
The above notwithstanding, the rest is quite wonderful. Conductor, pacing, baroque orchestra, choir. Plus truly outstanding, state-of-the-art sound. For all that, there goes my 4-star count.",1515369600,4

I know it sounds kinda lame now but you took what you could get in those days and was glad for it. Which brings me back to Miracles Out of Nowhere. A more appropriate title you couldn't dream up. The fact that Kansas is even in the news is a miracle. The story of Kansas is right out of a Hollywood script , solid gold , cue the Solid Gold Dancers, crank it up and enjoy some of the best music from the Seventies. Bonus cd to listen to in your car or wherever. Although the interviews between songs is purely bush league.

119270,56,11891,"It is honestly very sad whenever someone young and talented dies early. That has been the case already with the passing of their voice, Lemmy Kilmester, whom died back in late 2015 after having a sever battle with cancer. But that isn't alone just in regards to the passing of Lemmy. Sadly, the last surviving member of the original lineup of Motorhead has passed away. With the death of ""Fast"" Eddie Clark, it is a sad and heartbreaking reminder of what really great hard core rock music really was. Motorhead has had so many albums that drove in regards to Rock Music, but out of all of the songs and albums they have made in the world, Motorhead has had only one opus that really has withstood the test of time, with the release of Ace Of Spades. The song is just a fast and fierce anthem that really could rival with other 80's rock anthems like Pour Some Sugar On Me from Def Leppard & AC/DC's opus Back In Black. In any regards, if you have loved this song because of the legacy Motorhead had with Lemmy, you'll honor it for ""Fast"" Eddie Clark As Well.

119408,9114,15963,"In the first few minutes of this guided hypnosis program you are told:
Rumination is related to chronic anxiety and depression.
If you are already dealing with rumination your natural tendency is to escalate things. Hearing that over-thinking may be part of two worse issues; namely anxiety and depression, doesnt seem particularly helpful or mollifying, to me.
I also found his talking speed abnormally slow. As someone who has been trained in clinical hypnosis as part of my post graduate studies, I found it too slow. I started feeling tense waiting for his next words.
Still, some of the messages are very helpful, which is why I gave it three stars.
Also, some people might find the slightly droning background music calming...to each his own.
These guided meditation/hypnosis programs really come down to individual preference. You have to try them before you can know if they're helpful to you, or not.
I highly recommend the free mediations on the app called INSIGHT TIMER. Its truly incredible, and I have no vested interest...just a happy user of the service.
If you a dealing with Anxiety you can check out Glenn Harolds guided meditation on there. A super calming hypnosis style guided meditation.",1515888000,3

119450,56,7715,"It is honestly a heartbreaking moment, whenever somebody talented & gifted dies with a broken heart. When I had heard about the devastating death of Dolores O' Riordan, whom had fronted the cranberries throughout the 90's, I was shocked. It is so sad that she would die in the same way that we had lost George Michael a little over a year ago. She had a unique gift, but sadly, she let it go to waste, just as much with the same demons that plagued other divas whom had died young like Amy Winehouse and Whitney Houston. When I do think of their music, I think of it as a ladies' alternative to the success that U2 had garnered throughout the decades in hard rock. There have been some of The Cranberries songs that still do stand out today, but Linger was the first hit that still remains as stark and haunting, as the day it had came out. It truly is a song worth noticing from the soul, especially if you have never heard a Cranberries song before. This is the song that I sincerely recommend that you do go to first, as a everlasting memory to Dolores.

The rest of the band is amazing and plays great.  David spends a lot of time doing his shtick and yucking it up for the crowd,  he also seems to not even sing on some of the songs and sounds more like he is just speaking the words and he tends to do this Ethel Merman type high notes on some of the songs (I don't know how else to describe it.....).  It is much more noticeable on the first CD.  I find that the 2nd CD seems to be better and he actually sings on some of the songs.  It is tough to be so critical of it because the rest of the band plays so well.  I still like it even with all of the above.  It would have been so much better if he just sang the songs, did less shtick for the crowd and would stop with the goofy high notes.",1515974400,4

It has some very political undertones that could annoy some people and give the impression of being very bitter and angry.  Some of the songs need more melody to make them more listenable.  There are only a few instances where it has a very Floyd like sound to it.  It is definitely an album where you need to be in the mood for listening to it.",1515974400,3

119488,18749,6646,"The swing revival, also called retro swing and neo-swing, was a renewed interest in swing music, beginning in the 1990s. The music was rooted in the big bands of the swing era of the 1930 and '40s, but it was also influenced by rockabilly, boogie-woogie piano, the jump blues of Louis Prima, and the theatrics of Cab Calloway.  Wikipedia
------------
Personally, its always amazing experience to listen to a contemporary musician breathe new life into an oldfashioned musical genre. Artists like jazz trumpeter Brian Newman and the big band Squirrel Nut Zippers (Delta blues, gypsy jazz, 30s swing) to American songsters Dom Flemons (Piedmont blues, ragtime, string/jug band) and Pokey LaFarge (early jazz, ragtime blues, Appalachian folk).

Though I enjoyed this big band back when they arrived on the scene in the mid1990s _ and when they played the Super Bowl 33 (99) halftime show jammin with Stevie Wonder on Sir Duke _ it took me awhile to finally fully appreciate what they have to offer. Better late than never, I guess. Its been said that math is the language of the universe, and maybe so, but to me, music is the language of the human soul. I really enjoyed reconnecting with this swing band over this past holiday season!",1516147200,4

He's leaving no clues, left behind him
And they have no way of knowing
Of the suspect or what to expect
Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
Sounding heartbeats, intimidations

[Break]
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
Annie, are you okay? Are you okay?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?

[Bridge]
You've been hit by
You've been hit by
A Smooth Criminal

[Chorus]
Annie, are you okay?
Will you tell us that you're okay?
There's a sound at the window
Then he struck you  a crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom, Annie

[Post Chorus]
Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?

[Bridge]
You've been hit by
You've been struck by
A Smooth Criminal

[Outro]
Annie are you okay? (I don't know)
Will you tell us that you're okay? (I don't know)
There's a sound at the window (I don't know)
Then he struck you, a crescendo Annie? (I don't know)
He came into your apartment (I don't know)
Left bloodstains on the carpet (I don't know why baby)
And then you ran into the bedroom (Help me)
You were struck down
It was your doom Annie, (Daggonit)
Annie are you okay? (Daggonit baby)
Will you tell us that you're okay? (Daggonit baby)
There's a sound at the window (Daggonit baby)
Then he struck you, a crescendo Annie
He came into your apartment, (Daggonit)
Left bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down (Daggonit)
It was your doom Annie",1516147200,5

119675,17011,20913,"It seems several customers who leave those horrible and unhelpful one-liners were expecting more pop than jazz and were left mystified, if not unhappy.
As a Jazz project, this is a slick and lush release with outstanding vocals, effects and instrumental support. Some people might consider the extra voicings overproduced, but that becomes a matter of taste.
There is only one track that disappointed me to utter sadness: ""Spain"". You have to understand that for a Chick Corea fan since the 1970s, when memorable pieces were released with Return to Forever, there are two pieces that will never wear: 'Spain' and 'La Fiesta'. It's almost fifty years and the originals simply do not wear. It is very simple, when you compare the original 'Spain' (Polydor, 1972) you realize what is wrong with MT's version.
'Spain' has  two parts: an Intro (here called Prelude) where Rodrigo's 'Concierto de Aranjuez' is quoted. leading into the rhythmical frenzy of Spain proper (here subtitled 'I Can Recall'). For any Spanish speaker who grew up in Latin America, the Spanish pronunciation is horrible, fully stereotypical and uncomfortable to hear. But then, is then a lead into hot ""frenzy""? O no. They take it leisurely and square, almost in cavalier fashion. What a let down. I mean, if they could deliver ""Birdland"" and even here ""Armando's Rumba"" so well, there was no reason to arrange ""Spain"" like this. For me, it is a missed opportunity and the sole reason this CD is not tops.",1516579200,4
119676,1395,7560,"Everybody my age remembers it from way back when except me. That's okay,it's new to me,so I've got more to laugh about.",1516579200,4

And this song--it was both our favorite Cranberries song.  The song haunted my dreams the night she passed.  My daughter and I both love the way Dolores sang.  She was obviously proud of her heritage and never tried to hide her accent in her songs, and her voice played a big part in giving the band their signature sound.  If you've never heard a Cranberries record--this is probably the one to introduce yourself to their sound.",1516579200,5

The saxophone starts up in ""Get Ready"" and that alone makes the entire ride a pleasure. This is just one rockin' record and if you want to celebrate in style you need not look any longer. This is a tight band and the gruff vocals from the drummer sound perfect on top of this relentless music. I always thought Rare Earth gave Chicago a run for the money but today you don't hear them mentioned enough.

One of the greatest live records you have never heard.

119699,19057,18850,"Simply put, this is a fantastic album.  Maggie Herron is a superb musician in every way -- as a pianist, as a singer, and as a composer.  Add to that the fact that her low, smokey voice is one of the most compelling and unique in all jazz and popular music.  She is one of those singers whose voice is instantly identifiable, like Nate King Cole or Bob Dylan or PJ Harvey or Amy Winehouse.  It grabs and intoxicates you as she sings about all the great themes of life.  Equally important is that Maggie knows how to have fun with her music and how to truly entertain the listener in the best possible sense of that word.  On this CD her song ""Wolf"" is the prime example.  I truly enjoy chuckling as I dig this marvelous tune.  This is an album to be enjoyed time and time again.",1516665600,5

119701,198,12324,"There is nothing I do not like about this rendition of the old Simon and Garfunkel tune.  What I love about it is the absolute control and power that the lead singer has in his voice.  His ability to sing in the low registers  without any raspy, broken up tones is miraculous considering how loud this man has been pushing out songs for so long.  I couldn't believe it was DISTURBED when I looked it up and bought it.  The song ends with the vocals so clean, powerful and in tune that I'd say there are not many vocalists that match this type of excellent singing.

They do total justice to the song.  Considering that the same singer that wailed out the classic ""The Sickness"" is singing like this says a lot about how much work this man does to perfect his voice.  I haven't heard the album.  Just the one song.",1516665600,5

Producers made Nancy sing very softly on this so she didn't screw this one up.  Nancy does a very weird low harmony part that has been drastically improved upon by Nicole Kidman on the remake.",1516752000,4
119728,18979,10424,"Nancy rips off Cher but this recording has gotten her a lot of attention.  As you all know, no one knows more about the career of Nancy Sinatra than yours truly.  Almost 40 years after this forgotten recording was made, Tarantino saved it from obscurity for Kill Bill!  He could not afford Cher's version so he got Nancy's for practically nothing.  Then a few years later some Brits named the Audio Bully's also got to use the song for free and remixed it.  Unbelievable, it was a huge hit in the UK!  Once again, it takes others to help Nancy catch a break.  Like Lee Hazlewood in the 60s, these guys are her modern day Svengali.",1516752000,3

119778,4844,12721,"Five GROOVY Stars. From her album ""In The Flow"", this is the marvelous jazz flutist, Althea Rene, on what is probably her 5th album by this rising star who is well on her way to greater stardom. Over a groovy beat from drum rim shots, electric bass, keyboards, and guitar, the joyful ""Sunday Cruise"" theme is stated with Rene's beautiful tone and execution. Then she does some gorgeous, inventive vamping as she soars over a background woodwinds, guitars, keyboards, and horns in this winsome 'smooth jazz' recording. Featuring, on different tracks, the combination of Cindy Bradley on trumpet; Randy Scott on saxophone; multi-instrumentalist Dan Cipriano on saxophone, trombone, or trumpet; electric guitarist Freddie Fox; acoustic guitarist Thano Sahnas; Michael Broening on keyboards; Mel Brown on electric bass; John Herrera or Michael White on drums. Somewhat reminiscent of the days of flutist Bobbi Humphrey, Rene is setting her own course to the future while setting herself apart with her sweet-sounding, swinging axe. Highly Recommended. Five FESTIVE Stars.

 I was 16-17 when it was released. Stars was originally sung by Janis Ian. But Cher classified it as a true heartbreaker. This and Two the hard way with Greg Allman are my favorites. Just this one time .. is amazing rock n roll.. Cher's voice carries a gentle breath of heartbreak (as does Elton John).. and I'm glad to see.. she's a bigger draw today than the remaining big guns of the last few decades. Cher is Living Proof..(ok..pun).. age is just a number. You'll get there soon enough.. be kind. Cause karma will kick your ass if you're not. Love Cher.",1517011200,5

I can't help but wonder, this late in the game, why he doesn't stick closer to his winning formula.

119984,1895,20923,"After encountering their splendid second opus, Moving Day, I obtain the debut album, Event Horizon. Classically trained bassist and composer Mark Wade formed this trio with Tim Harrison at the piano and Scott Neumann on drums, and while in comparison the album does not have the same unity in performance and album concept nor structural inventiveness, the music is still captivating. Opening with Jump for Joy and an extensive bass solo and continuum, Harrison proves no second fiddle with his keyboard development. Shifting the mood with The Prisoner, Wade again leads the trio into dark tones; after a crescendo, including drums, the piece exhales and ends abruptly. Apogee has a lyrical piano against the grumbling bass and drum ground. Singsong, which meanders, has discrete triplet phrases as punctuation; the drums have opportunity to solo in commentary. Tossed implies upheaval and mixture; musically, the bass introduces a rhythmic motif that the trio expands into a bouncy groove. In contrast, Valley and Stream suggest a smooth flow, and here indeed the piano plays a slow ballad picked up by the bass first by plucking then by bowing. For the middle section the tempo picks up with emphatic beats. Another title metaphor is Twist in the Wind, which is demonstrated by fast and strong chordal textures and snare beats and cymbal work. Next is a quieting and relaxation as Cold Spring provides space among the piano keys while Wade's bass explores the fingerboard. The only tune not belonging to Wade's pen is If I Only Had a Brain [Oz's scarecrow's wish]; taken with a light touch on all instruments, the album ends in good spirits. Wade's bass tends to dominate this first album, but the musicianship and composition skills are already evident.",1517529600,4
119985,18003,2958,"As with most DC5 hits collections this one is also compiled more based on UK popularity verses US. The sound quality is excellent. The final song, ""Universal Love"" is the only previously unreleased track. Its pretty good. Nice to hear that great Mike Smith vocal on a new song. Overall, its pretty similar to the ""Glad All Over Again"" CD. The only difference is the new unreleased song and one other extra song not included on ""Glad All Over Again"". I'd probably opt for whichever one I could find cheapest.

Better yet, from an American perspective, I still prefer the 2-CD collection ""History Of The Dave Clark Five"" if you can find it. There you get 50 songs with a nice selecton of album tracks. But, even that release still falls short in my eyes as it doesn't include many of their latter day U.S. single releases that either didn't chart or charted very briefly. Worse yet, like all other DC5 hits collections, it actually doesn't include two songs that charted fairly high in 1967, ""A Little Bit Now"" and ""You Must Have Been A Beautiful Baby"". For the life of me I can't understand why these two songs always get excluded. I'd love to hear those very hard to find songs. We can only hope for a nice rarities release someday but based on Dave Clark's track record, I wouldn't hold my breath.",1517529600,4

119991,470,2792,"Released in 2007, IMMORTALIS is Overkills fourteenth of (currently) eighteen albums. While it lacks essential Overkill tracks like Bold Face Pagan Stomp and Wheelz it makes up for it with its heaviness and consistency from beginning to end without being one-note conventional thrash, like IRONBOUND (2010) and THE ELECTRIC AGE (2012). (Dont get me wrong, those albums are seriously kinetic and I like em).

As far as consistency goes, I listened to IMMORTALIS the other day while working out and it dawned on me that I liked the album from open to close. Several of my favorites include:

Whatever it Takes, which is heavy as a freight train and just primal.

""Skull and Bones, which includes additional vocals by the singer of Lamb of God.

""Hellish Pride, which cops a nice groove, has an interesting mellow bridge and a catchy chorus.

""Head On, which features a great acoustic opening (kinda reminiscent of the eerie mid-section of ""Rime of the Ancient Mariner"") and Bobby Blitz getting really creative with the vocals.

""Overkill V: The Brand"", which is easily the most inventive song here. It starts as an eerie mood piece put picks up by the minute mark, gets more eerie, and then goes into overkill, pun intended. It ends the same way it starts.

While IMMORTALIS may not rank up there with THE KILLING KIND (1996), FROM THE UNDERGROUND AND BELOW (1997) and KILLBOX 13 (2003), its a solid Overkill release. Its about on par with RELIXIV (2005) and maybe slightly superior.

120002,3161,20925,"Jazz guitar legend Pat Martino, who still fortunately is still active and just released a fine album, ""Formidable"", last fall, was one player who was not afraid to go exploring musically.  While deeply influenced by and having played with the greatest guitarists of the 1960's, including Grant Green and being one of Wes Montgomery's most loyal disciples, with the emergence in the late 1960's of funk music and rock in general, he would release albums that were unquestionably jazz but filled with elements of rock and funk thrown in to give the music a more contemporary feel for fans who may have not been at the time too interested in more traditional bebop or hard bop.
  His debut, ""El Hombre"", for example, could have been considered a jazz rock album easily, and ""Joyous Lake"", released in 1976, was a fusion album that easily rivaled other similar albums of the day.  From the first cut, ""Line Games"", with a twisting and pounding riff that sends out the warning that you will not be listening to lullabies on this record, to the end and title track ""Joyous Lake"", Martino delivers a set alongside synthesizers and a very funky rhythm section that burns.  His playing regardless of the setting has always been in the best taste, and he keeps up a very groove oriented storm throughout.
  I detect similarities between ""Joyous Lake"" and Jeff Beck's first two jazz fusion albums, ""Blow By Blow"" and ""Wired"".  While the two are not similar in style particularly, they both are very successful in the fusion era of their careers.  Beck of course would be a bit more rock, while Martino laid down a bit more mellow path but no less impressive.
  That this is the same fellow who did the Montgomery influenced or just plain homage album ""Footprints"" shows how easily Pat Martino adapted his playing to whatever style fluctuation was demanded.  After his terrible brush with death and a brain aneurysm that robbed him of the ability to play at all, Martino's playing took a slightly more traditional and pensive direction but his playing remained stellar after he doggedly taught himself to play again.  ""Joyous Lake"" is one of his most energetic albums and while my copy was a Japanese import, complete with Japanese language and liner notes, it doesn't matter because the music should transcend normal boundaries and reach everybody on a much deeper level.  A great album all the way around.",1517702400,5

120015,1108,2183,"For a long time the only song I regularly listened to by Toto was ""Rosanna.""  What can I say -- you tend to stick to the music you grew up with.  But after hearing from multiple sources that ""Africa"" was one of their best, I decided to give it a listen.  Turns out I'd heard it before, I just hadn't known the title or connected it to Toto at all.  And while I still prefer ""Rosanna"" over ""Africa,"" ""Africa"" is still a very enjoyable song, and makes me want to check out more by the band.

""Africa"" is a nice upbeat song, a well-done mix of pop and rock with a tune that's pleasant to listen to and good vocal harmonies.  The lyrics are somewhat generic -- despite the occasional Africa references (such as Kilimanjaro), it seems more like a generic love song than anything else.  Still, as another well-known band likes to say, ""some people wanna fill the world with silly love songs, and what's wrong with that?""

A pleasant song, and a good listen for anyone who enjoys Toto or '80s music in general.  Pairs nicely with ""Rosanna"" or anything by Starship or Journey.",1517788800,4

Jumpin' Jehoshaphat!!! I took one look at the prices being asked for the Lettuce cd's and had to reconsider. Is there a free
concert ticket included for my local area with every purchase or what??? Nope, at least it doesn't say so, therefore l suspect
( probably accurately ) that this is just a blatant and greedy attempt at price gouging by an opportunist bunch of mediocre musicians. What kind of fame or reputation are they seeking by asking such exorbitant prices for a tiny plastic disc anyway ? This band has to be near and dear to Trump's corporate heart !!!
  Cut to the chase now, and what is it you'll be getting for almost $ 50.00 per cd ( and in some cases more even ) as a consumer- a Gold Disc???? Not even, People.... you'll be getting what everybody else is getting for $7.95 - a cd. Maybe with some liner notes hyping the band included- And the music ??? A slightly updated version of other people's music
( are there no more copyright laws?)

You Will Be Personally Contributing to paying higher prices for everybody else's cd's from now on. Boycott these guys and their greed ! I Will.  P. S.

now that i have the full album, which i love, i find that rae's music has always come in to my life and helped me heal a little after some shock. maybe because she selects great songwriters to cover and they go so well with her own songs. or maybe it's because she and producers create music that satisfies my cravings for an urban, sophisticated sound that suits a variety of moods. or maybe it's because her initially twee voice has so much complexity in it.

I have loved every single thing that she's put and out will continue to buy everything she does (her latest soundtrack work is out of this world. This record, unfortunately, isn't. It should have been an EP. It's simply too long. It's a concept that is surprisingly limited--a woman widowed at the altar.  I think that the version she did as a live concert was much better, and more solid. She just stretched the concept too thin, and it shows. Also, lyrically, it is lacking. Natasha Khan is a lyrical genius; The Haunted Man was a masterpiece. Somehow The Bride doesn't even manage to show off her voice. After Sunday Love, both the narrative and the quality sort of taper off. That being said, ""I Do,""  ""Joe's Dream,"" and ""In God's House"" are some of the finest things she's ever written.",1518480000,3

120263,1751,20938,"I immediately sought out this 2015 album after hearing the band's 2017 follow-up, ""Pillar of Fire.""  They are both superb -- hard rock with crust punk and metal influences and militant anarchist politics.  Rob ""The Baron"" Miller is the singer, songwriter, and bass player, formerly of the influential British crust punk band Amebix.  The drummer is Michael ""Away"" Langevin, formerly of Voivod, the Quebec progressive metal band.

Miller's raspy bellow sounds quite a bit like Lemmy of Motorhead, another bass player.  He is apparently influenced by 16th century British mysticism, among other things, and the apocalyptic mood of the hard-charging music summons a feeling of early modern times.  The raven seems to be a favorite symbol, as it appears in the artwork on both albums.

The 12-page booklet in the Relapse disc is nicely done, with all the lyrics and impressive art.",1518566400,5

In Berkeley, he opened for Jesse Colin Young, whom most of the audience came to see and most of whom were unfamiliar with Waits' music and surprised by his style (to say the least). In any case, I love just about everything Tom Waits has recorded, but this period of his music has a special place for me.

Her music is a lovely blend of old-fashioned music styles (such as folk and Celtic), and her voice is both haunting and ethereal, lending an otherworldly beauty to her songs.  ""The Highway Man"" was a fantastic choice to render into song form, telling a powerful and emotional story about two lovers and the forces that ultimately tear them apart.

I hope to give the rest of the ""Book of Secrets"" album a listen soon... but in the meantime, ""The Mummer's Dance"" and ""The Highway Man"" are beautiful numbers and deserve more recognition.",1518825600,5

120393,7472,20386,"While ""Twilight Zone"" broke the barrier on TV for serous, thought provoking science fiction and fantasy, ""The Outer Limits"" took that creative approach one step further. As great as Rod Serling's stories were (and Serling was the primary author of ""The Twilight Zone"" as he wrote the majority of the scripts with breath taking speed and an amazing level of prolific output not seen since), they would occasionally depend all too often on an O. Henry styled twist. ""The Outer Limits"" rarely did this shooting for more straight forward dramatic material with an element of what would be later termed gothic science fiction with its moody cinematography and horror tropes woven into the fabric of science fiction.

Just as ""The Outer Limits"" wasn't a knock off of ""The Twilight Zone"" as a drama. the same was true of the music provided by the talented Dominic Frontiere. Frontiere's evocative melodies, use of dissonance was not unlike what Jerry Goldsmith and Bernard Herrman would do as well. Frontiere could compose music as moving as the themes for the episode ""The Man Who Was Never Born"" as he could the fear invoking score for ""Nightmare"". There was indeed both awe and mystery in his music reflecting the writing of primary script author/producer Joseph Stefano (""Psycho"") or the ideas of creator/writer/executive producer Leslie Stevens.

This three CD set uses the original score master tapes for the series expanding on the previous single release from GNP over a decade ago. It's pity that the multi-tracks are unavailable as it would be nice to have these remixed to stereo for this set but, given that they aren't these mono transfers are robust (for mono) and dynmaic. Keep in mind however that these suffer from the limitations of the time.

This release from LA LA Land was limited to only 3000 copies (hence the high price here--they sold out and those who purchased them probably decided to charger a premium for them). The set is handsomely packaged with a nice, thick booklet with comments from the late Frontiere himself, photos of Stevens, Frontiere and Stefano behind-the-scenes during shooting and recording sessions. The notes also point out those instances where Frontiere would recycle elements of these scores for ""The Invaders"" (after Five Star Productions was dismissed at the conclusion of the first season, the episodes eliminated that gohtic horror element and noir lighting save for a handful of episodes such as ""Demon With A Glass Hand"" and ""Soldier"" both written by Harlan Ellison) and the music also changed altering the mood the series as well with composer Harry Lubin (""One Step Beyond"") providing an interesting and servicable series of scores that, largely, were much less imaginative than Frontiere's.

The series of episode scores are presented as ""suites"" (and not all of them are available--like a lot of series at the time certain episodes benefited from original scores while others used pre-existing cues that Frontiere had written for other episodes and could be applied more universally) as some of the original score tapes are missing as well. Luckily, we get the best of Frontiere's work here (along with one of his mentors who Frontiere hired to compose elements of a couple of episodes to help take the burden off of him).

Recorded with a larger than usual orchestra, the scores, although in mono (with the exception of one track about which we don't get any history as to how or why it is in stereo) sound terrific for that very reason. Whether or not Frontiere used a vaccum cleaner to create unusual sounds (he did so on more than one occasion as well as, like Jerry Goldsmith, resorted to unusual instruments in some instances to give his music a unique flavor), his scores were always well written, imagintive and often times deeply moving.

Yes, this set is fairly expensive from collector's but part of that is the limited nature of these sets and the fact that they sold out more quickly. The single disc from GNP is more widely widely available and less expensive using three scores that are here as well. That might be another option for those of you who can't or won't pay the heavier price associated with a rarity like this.

I would love to see the second season scores by Lubin available as well. Even if he wasn't quite as an accomplished composer as Frontiere, he, at this best, did some remarkable work that is well wroth having including the unique score for ""Demon With A Glass Hand"". Unfortunately, because Lubin isn't quite as well regarded, I doubt that we will see another set.",1518912000,5

120401,1726,8095,"For most devotees of classical music there is a special fondness for the slow gentle movements in symphonies (the pinnacle may be the Adagietto from Mahlers Symphony No. 5 which happens to be the initial track on this recording!). This collection is a generous sampling of the great Adagio movements in the literature and though the performing groups and orchestras and conductors vary the overall result is a very satisfying entry into another uncluttered world.

One excellent example is a work by Italian Baroque composer Tomaso Giovanni Albinoni (8 June 1671  17 January 1751) whose Adagio in G is present in varying forms  the original for strings is performed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra & David Parry as is an adaptation Adagio in G Minor for Strings and Organ. This particular work is often used by film composers to special effects  as in the current The Assassination of Gianni Versace, Gallipoli, L'anne dernire  Marienbad, Rollerball, Manchester by the Sea, Flashdance, etc.

The selections are excellent and well placed in the sequence for listening. Relax, allow the present to go away for a bit of time and feel the restorative powers of Adagios. Grady Harp, February 18",1518912000,5

120416,261,20949,"This was a fun retro moment. As a youngster, I used to buy ""grab bags"" of 45s. There would be10 inside a clear shrink wrap. You could see the two oldie records on the ends, but the other 8 were hidden. This was in the days before old records where a valuable selling genre. I really started my record collection with these ""bags"" Some real finds were inside.

When I came upon this product by accident, I compulsively had to buy a pack. Of course, none of the 50 were revealed. Still when the pack arrived I was quickly looking to discover my ""finds"". All but one played very well. Unfortunately, it was Billy Myles ""The Joker"" on the Ember log burning label. It plays but the noise factor, though not high, is disturbing.
But for the rest it was a fun time. There certainly was some junk but most were by artists who had charted. Some of the better finds were Jimmy Clanton's ""Just a Dream""; John Lennon's ""Stand By Me""; Joe Bennett & the Sparkletones ""Black Slacks""; Buffalo Springfield's ""Nowadays Clancy Can't Even Sing""; Cheap Trick's ""Everything Works If You Let It""; The Gentry's ""Cinnamon Girl""; The Turtles ""Sound Asleep"" and AC/DC's ""Let's Get It up"".
Most fell between 1958 and the mid-70s.
I'll most likely do this again since it's like a vinyl junkie's Christmas.",1518998400,5
120417,9069,12108,"Over four albums, Grace Potter & the Nocturnals have passed from their folk-rock beginnings to Potter wielding her open-E-tuned Gibson Flying V through stadium-stompers rockers like Paris (Ooh La La) and The Lion the Beast the Beat.  Midnight continues this trend with Hot to the Touch, Alive Tonight, and the rebel-yell Instigators.  However, rumors are that Potter fired The Nocturnals halfway through the album, relying much more heavily on collaborative writing with producer Eric Valentine  who also played nearly all the instruments on Midnight.  This insular approach resulted in quite a number of tracks that don't sound as fully developed as they might have been with input from a fully experienced band.  The drum-machined Delirious sounds like a Gloria Estefan knockoff.  The melody of The Miner bears more than a passing resemblance to Paul McCartneys My Love.  And Your Girl is Prince without the prance.  Lyrically, nothing on Midnight carries the soulful fire of Potters biggest ballad Stars, from her previous album The Lion the Beast the Beat.  If Nobodys Born with a Broken Heart is supposed to be poetically profound, Potters romance with Valentine has clearly weakened her critical judgment as a writer.  And while Potter remains in fine voice, the diminished influence of The Nocturnals leaves Midnight a mixed bag of tricks.",1518998400,3

This album is somewhat darker than other material I've purchased from her stand-up albums, in that she deals with the sexual abuse she experienced on a city bus as a child.  She also covers her sexual experimentation during college and her husband's job as a video game programmer, both of which she talked about in previous albums.  Having said that, there is a lot of new material which is laugh out loud hilarious.  I love this woman's comedy and I recommend this album if you do, too.

The only thing telling you this is remastered is a little snippet in the booklet, which is basically just the cover, back, and a page with lyrics. It's all fairly pedestrian. I literally sent the first disc back because I thought it was the 80s disc. I cannot believe they went so cheap on these. It is literally almost impossible to tell this is a remastered disc.

The three disc Master of Puppets release is by far the best one for the affordable versions. The remaster here has some slight tweaking, but otherwise sounds nearly the same as the old disc. Dynamic range is still very good for metal. If you want to revisit these classics, these cheap editions are the way to do it. I just wish they had given the buyer any clue how to differentiate these besides the small snippet in the cheap booklet. Bare minimum quality digipack, but it is low cost I guess.

120545,8703,17374,"About six years ago I saw Michael Shrive's Spellbinder play at a small local festival and was blown away by his world class musicianship. This CD recorded a few years later sounds a lot like I remember, although I'm not sure how much is the same line-up (different guitarist for sure), it's also world class.

Shrieve is a GREAT drummer, while fretless bassist Farko Dosumov makes for a great partner in rhythm. Keyboardist Joe Doria, trumpeter John Fricke and guitarist Danny Godinez (electric and acoustic) all add an amazing range of tasteful highlights and musical insights. But Spellbinder really is more than the sum of it's parts, with the classic fusion sound they create veering back and forth between the jazz and prog rock sides, with a fair bit of funk and latin mixed in. The beauty is that while some of these tunes seem almost familiar (hinting at times of Santana, Return to Forever, Pat Metheny or King Crimson) they never sound derivative nor stuck in the past. My only complaint would be that the liner notes are minimal (track titles and composer credits only), with no mention of who plays what, or when and where it was recorded etc., but then again these Seattle boys do a good job of just letting the music speak for itself...",1519171200,5

120599,396,20960,"This set has been available for a while now in this edition and has already been reviewed, but I find this music to be so great that I thought I'd (hopefully) bring some more attention to this live set for fans of Hall and/or jazz guitar.  The set is from artistShare (sic)  which is fan-funded.

The original edition from a few years ago (of 250 copies I believe) had the three CDs of music and an extra High Resolution disc included.  The packaging was a 150 page hardcover book-style package which is no longer available, and the cost was (to me) high--$75.  But it sold out quickly leaving many fans in the cold.

The set now available for around $40 (still a bit expensive)  is just the three CDs of music in a nice three panel foldout cardboard package.  The discs each have a pocket--which have been intelligently cut to facilitate getting each disc out of it's pocket--a list of tracks for each disc, a list of personnel, a b&w photo of Hall and bassist Thompson (no Clarke sadly) at Bourbon Street, and recording information.  That's it.  While the music is the most important thing here, I do wish a booklet could've been included--maybe not 150 pages like the original--but at least a few pages about the gig and the music for Hall's many fans--and especially for fans of this gig.

I still own the original LP I purchased way back in the '70s on A&M, and it's still one of my favorite jazz guitar albums.  If you're reading this you're probably aware of that original album, and this set of volumes 2-4 is equally good.  If for some reason you're unfamiliar with this music--and like jazz guitar--do yourself a big favor and listen to the original album (Vol. 1) under the title ""Live!"" which is available for little money.  It's full of standards (as are volumes 2-4) but Hall and the band imbue them with a sparkling life that captures your attention from the outset.  Then if you can swing it, purchasing volumes 2-4 will be a no-brainer.  Jazz guitar doesn't get any better than hearing Hall, Clarke, and Thompson on this live date back in '75.",1519257600,5

120653,1805,558,"I am going to admit that the only reason I picked this up is because I came across I Surrender on YouTube and was moved to worship and tears.  I wanted that song in my collection and hoped that I would find more of the same.  Well, I both did and didnt.  I did because there is a bounty of worship none of which I was familiar with but I didn't because I didn't find any other song that generated the same type of emotional or worshipful connection that I Surrender did.  Im not terribly into worship music and don't like a lot of it so when I find something that I resonate so strongly with I end up having high hopes.  I wasn't disappointed but sometimes I found myself having to work at being engaged.  I do think that the albums last two tracks, Greater Than All with its crescendoing force and a studio version of Hope of the World with an upfront piano line and steady rhythm, are very good worship songs.  Vocalists vary and include both men and women leads.  There are some other tracks on here that are moving or that I just enjoy (the production is such that the live experience is muted and it really sounds more like a studio album with background shouts and choral voices and echoes tracked down) and I was surprised at how long Hillsong has been doing this and it being commercially available.  Personally I don't know that I will go out and purchase another Hillsong Live disc but at least they're on my radar.",1519430400,4

Anyways, like I always say, music is personal, you'll either love this or hate it. But give it a shot, plenty of sources on the internet that you
can listen to it.
But if you want to carry it around with you, go ahead & buy it. Support the artist, support the delivery method. It's well worth it.

120742,3161,2958,"Some of the greatest rock and roll of all time came from the 1960's, and what makes the decade so extraordinary is how the bands sounded coming in at the first and leaving by 1970.  The Dave Clark Five started as the Dave Clark Quintet, the history going back to 1957, which is important as far as Beatles comparisons.  While historians rightfully put The Beatles at the top of the heap from this amazing decade, we would be remiss (and wrong) to assume there weren't other outfits who were no clones at all, and doing equally fabulous work of their own.  The U.S. had The Beach Boys and The Four Seasons - Britain of course gave us the fabled British Invasion, with tons of clones of the Beatles, but a few that were genuinely the real deal.  Most folks will probably agree that The Yardbirds and The Dave Clark Five were the top of the line competitors to the Fab Four, although The Yardbirds, who boasted Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page as lead guitarists, were setting the stage for heavy music, especially after Jeff Beck split to form the Jeff Beck Group, and Page formed Led Zeppelin.
  The DC5 were more pure rock and rollers, and they knew their stuff!  This album was available just in the last few weeks for about $25, so I'm surprised the price has jumped up again.  Dave Clark committed one of the biggest blunders in rock history when, after the band broke up in 1970, he saw fit not to release any material at all until after 2000, by which time LP's had worn out, there were probably very few cassettes, and they don't last either, and radio stations dropped them after their copies were too beat up to play.  This meant a generation would come and go before the public got to hear them again, and by that time only those who were teens in the '60's even knew who the DC5 even were.
  A splendid PBS documentary did raise awareness, including mine, and although I had heard them before, I had not paid much attention.  I'm glad I did now, because they were great.  Tons of hits here include ""Glad All Over"", ""Any Way You Want It"", ""Sha Na Na Hey Kiss Him Goodbye"", which is much tougher than the more watered down version usually played on the radio, and other great songs that bristled with energy and great playing throughout.  It is interesting to speculate what may have happened had this amazing band continued and started forging new sounds.  They were already tough as nails, so they could have been big time hard rockers with more guitars.  Unfortunately we will never know.
  But for those who love real genuine rock and roll at its best, and want to hear what other outfits from the Beatlemania years sounded like, you really owe it to yourself to check out the Dave Clark 5.",1519603200,5
120743,1577,15280,"Even though I heard this song in the 90's I forgot who the artist was. I was overjoyed when I heard it on The show The Assassination of Gianni Verace. It is a great dance mix version, that is fast, mixing drums & techno. I love the vocals, if U can dance to this song, check your pulse. If U think U know it, listen to the MP3. You will be hook, line, and sinker. I know U will love it.",1519603200,5

120746,2674,8210,"I'm a longtime Poco fan, having enjoyed their mid to late 1970s albums as much as the earlier so-called ""classic"" stuff. To my ears, it's all strong. I wasn't even aware of this ""comeback"" album until I found it in a used CD shop recently. To my pleasant surprise this proved to be a very strong album. People can quibble about this being called a Poco album, as opposed to a Rusty Young solo album, but it actually is a real band effort.

Joining Rusty, and handling some songwriting and singing duties, is a guy named Jack Sundrud. Never heard of him before, but I think he sounds a lot like Don Henley when he sings. In fact, I could have sworn that was Henley singing on a few tracks, but the liner notes revealed no such surprises.

Pick your favorites, but there are several excellent songs on here, including the closing instrumental, ""Pucky Huddle Stomp."" Very gratifying to hear Rusty and his ""new"" band still making vibrant music. That magical country-rock vibe continues!",1519603200,5

However.

The lyrics just feel hollow, as for the meaning of the song, when the corporations and governments of this world are more toxic than ever. The Beatles nailed it over half a century ago... ""You say you want a revolution..."" But no one's got the stones to make it happen ever again.

Instead, we'll bury our heads in the sand and let the right and left and the megacorporations and religions a, b, and c, control our world while we slave away to prop them up further above us every day. Good luck out there.",1520121600,5

Released back in 1969 as a single this is long before FM would be known for their mega-hit songs and album's. Rather this is old school FM when they were known as a blues band. The line up of the group includes Peter Green, Jeremy Spencer and Danny Kirwan on guitars with John McVie on bass and Mick Fleetwood on drums. The song itself is an instrumental with a slow bluesy feel and mood to it. It is to me one of the loveliest songs ever produced by this band from their entire songbook.

121014,4167,20537,"This set follows Haebler's 1963-71 Philips set. It is quite similar but
not identical.  Similarities include great precision, warmth and an impeccable
technique devoted to clarifying content. The newer set contains a bit more
power and emotional/spiritual depth served by a slightly superior Denon acoustic.
However the Philips set includes more short works such as some Variations,
Fantasies and Mozart's greatest short  work, the B minor Adagio k540.
My favorites sound better than ever in the Denon set: the sonatas k284 (especially
its first movement variations-the last of which sounds ten years later // the
ninth piano concerto k271),  310, 332 and 475/457.  A treasurable set",1520208000,5

Glass Houses was one of those albums that I never really liked. However, ""You may be right"" is one of the best Billy Joel tracks. It's upbeat, humorous, and lyrically clever. The music carries the mood and the song tells a story that will surely resonate with a lot of people. Great song, shame about the album",1520380800,4

Tom Petty and the Hearbreakers are on top of there game throughout these shows, recorded at various venues over many years. Whether it's original material or a tasty cover tune, Petty shows why fans loved him so much, performing every song with unbridled energy, passion, and emotional depth. Whether it's a rocker or a mid-tempo song Petty and the band know the way to your heart.

Another one of the (many) joys in listening to this set are the spontaneous audience participation bits. Mutual love. Mutual respect. Petty was simply one of the VERY best in the business. His studio albums were almost all great ones, but I think he especially thrived in a live setting. Listen to this and savor every song. And yeah, go ahead and sing along too!",1520812800,5

121403,19218,19057,"Herb's 14th
1. Hurt So Bad : 10/10 Great opening song. Catchy driving beat. Hits the perfect vibe right off the bat. I love the  interplay between trombone and trumpet. And that slow, sad section in the middle...ahh yeah. Hurts so good.
2. Jerusalem : 10/10 Poignant and melodic.
3. Martha My Dear : 5/10 Standard Beatles cover. Not unpleasant, but not very inspired.
4. If You  Could Read My Mind : 7/10 Nice version of the Gordy classic.
5. Darlin' : 7/10 Interesting take on the Beach Boys. Happy-go-lucky mood gets suddenly interrupted by some serious shoe-gazing.
6. Summertime : 7/10 This is a tough one. On the one hand, I can't really warm up to the vocal arrangement. On the other hand, the wandering jazzy trumpet sounds really cool.
7. The Nicest Things Happen : 10/10 My favorite Wechter tune. Hopeful, optimistic. That shimmering acoustic guitar and the gentle trumpet musings...Sounds like a road trip movie soundtrack from the early seventies, but yet, it is timeless, and beautiful in every way.
8. Montezuma's Revenge : 9/10 I'm sad. No more Sol Lake tunes in Herb's portfolio. Laid back vibe with a breezy outro.
9. Catch a Falling Star : 4/10 All that glockenspiel or whatever that is, ain't my fave. I do like the vocal though.
10. Strike up the Band : 1/10 This one's DOA.
70/100 (3.5/5)

One of the other reviews state that these songs are odds and ends from previous recording sessions. That makes sense, because it does sound like a mixed bag. Here you have some of Herb's best. Hurt so Bad can stand up to any TJB classic. And you have The Nicest Things Happen, a really unexpected tune in a very different, appealing style. And one last tune from the great Sol Lake. But then you got the filler. Another uninspired Beatles take. Strike up the Band falls flat as a pancake. Catch a Falling Star is kind of boring. You get the point. Some good. Some bad. If you're looking for a place to start with the TJB, maybe this album can wait.

It is interesting to compare Herb's trumpet style on these later recordings with the earlier ones. Starting with SRO, he began moving in more of a jazzy, breathy direction--and away from his previous more open, straight-forward approach. I like both styles, but I really think his later TJB trumpet sound is seriously great. He has a light, fluttery,feathery, sinewy touch--a sort of jazz impressionism. While his rhythm section churns, Herb's trumpet burns. He conjures clusters of notes out of thin air, like spices magically falling from heaven, into your bowl of chili. Of course, its not just the trumpet that appeals to TJB fans. Its the whole studio production--the inventive arrangements, the guitars, the trombone, the marimbas, the mandolin, etc. With Herb and the Brass, you get it all.",1520899200,4

A few months after he was gone, I ran across a tribute to The Beatles and the song While My Guitar Gently Weeps where Prince, with Tom Petty, Jeff Lynne, and others was playing this live - I was a little taken aback when Prince stepped up and played the main guitar solo and holy crap, it was amazing to say the least - The Guy Shredded it and did so with such raw and pure emotion that it literally brought tears to my eyes - Needless to say after that I started doing searches for Prince doing other amzing guitar works and, I mean I am really ashamed to some extent that I never gave this guy a listen too many years ago - I mean here's Jimi Hendrix's passion, Michael Jackson's musical craetivity, Jimmy Page's Studio Prowess all tied into one - I respect this man, I adore this man, and I am deeply regretful I never saw him Live.

121623,1108,13975,"In the vein of ""You Might Be A [fill-in-the-blank] If..."" lists everywhere, there's this one -- ""You might be a '90s kid if you associate 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' with this song instead of the Truman Capote novel or the Audrey Hepburn film based off of it.""  Not that that's a bad thing.  If anything, ""Breakfast At Tiffany's"" (the song) was a mainstay of my childhood, a nostalgic hit that reminds me of a less complicated time of my life and brings back fond memories.  And while the song is ostensibly about a couple on the verge of breaking up and struggling to find something in common (with both of them liking the titular film being the only common ground they seem to have), the song itself is surprisingly upbeat and warm.

I may not know anything else Deep Blue Something has released, and I still need to watch ""Breakfast At Tiffany's"" (the movie) at some point in my life.  But in the meantime, this song still evokes strong memories of my childhood and early teens, and for that I love it.",1521417600,5

And refreshingly, quite a few non-redundant, played to death orchestral works common to all these'Various Artists' compilations.  Unfortunately, the producers of these .99's can't afford to waste time or concern for the PURCHASER, writing down the actual track info for us curiosos.  Fortunately, in most of these compilations 'Comments', some generous soul, pitying those less knowledgeable(me), actually lists composer by track(s).  Thank you to those selfless souls.",1521504000,5

121866,525,21000,"I cant believe Im so addicted to this album. I didn't think I would like it this much. It takes the chiptune idea to new heights. I believe he takes a game boy sound chip and hacks it to make music but adds many other layers on top of that to make something truly exceptional and unique. This makes for a very nostalgic sounding album in a strange way, but also feels very majestic, soothing, and introspective at certain times.

I cant choose my favorite song because each song I listen to feels like my favorite song until the next one starts. And then, when I listen to this it ends up staying in my head all day and I need to come home and listen again. I cant wait to see what else Kubbi has to offer!",1521849600,5

121869,10735,11985,"I have aversion to ""New Age"" music, tends to remind me a little too much of elevator music, although recently I heard a Led Zeppelin song played with strings in an elevator so so much for that.  I first found Brian Crain on his piano & cello CD.  I love the cello and love that album.  This one with a violin instead isn't quite as near to my heart but it's still good.  My one big peeve is, why are there no liner notes???  I want to know who wrote what, who is that playing the violin?  All that kind of stuff.  I don't need a bio or some mystic hocus-pocus.  Just some information please.  I woudl recommend this to anyone who likes this ""relaxing"" music, get a nice glass of favorite wine, take off your shoes and put your feet up, close your eyes and let the music ease all those knots in your neck and back.",1521849600,4

After their lead singer passed away recently, I looked her up because she had a lot of fans who were crushed by her death; I thought she had to have *something"" to make her passing so dispiriting.  Delores O'Riorden had a voice you'd never forget, and this song was haunting in its melody but she put it over the top and made it unforgettable.  The only singer I can think of who came close to Ms. O'Riorden was Sinead O'Connor. The Cranberries songs are more pop whereas, Sinead's songs are less so.",1522022400,5

I have become a fan of ""screen"" and ""trees"". They have such deep content in their music that just speaks me on so many levels. I am not sure how other people interpret their music but I'm a christian going through some things right now with God (I'm not leaving, I'm just going through some things that's all) hints the song ""kitchen sink"" I hate what I believe and I love it at the same time. so I interpret a lot of their songs on a deep spiritual level. a lot of music that on the radio now is all about sex, drugs, alcohol, clubbing, and just empty to me, so its refreshing to me to come across music that's so raw with feeling and it just speaks to me. just buy it, you won't regret it.",1522108800,5

122017,19218,19056,"Herb's 15th

1. Fox Hunt : 10/10 Vibrant and feel-good opener with a great, driving melody with nice syncopation and, as usual, really satisfying trumpet/trombone interplay. The accordion gives it a wistful whisper. Meanwhile, the steel drums give it a sunny island touch.
2. Legend of the One Eyed Sailor : 7/10  A mixed bag. The first section (my favorite part) is pensive and full of slow burning soul. The second vamps for awhile, almost conjuring up the bullfighting ring, and the third one jumps into a middle east style groove.
3. I Can't Go On Living, Baby, Without You : 8/10 From the jaunty feel of it, he's not having any trouble living at all. Steel drums and some more margaritas. Thank you very much.
4. I Might Frighten Her Away : 10/10  Plaintive and beautifully melodic. Julius Wechter's vibes sound just right, and John Pisano's guitar provides perfect accompaniment.
5. You Smile, the Song Begins : 10/10 Trumpet heard through a misty glaze. Supple, expressive bass. Wechter providing light seasoning on vibes. Ah, the gently weeping guitar. That little turnaround section meanders a bit--but the rest of the song is so magical, that it has to be a 10.
6. Up Cherry Street : 6/10 Eh. Didn't care for this  much on the earlier album. Feel about the same now, but I think this new one is slightly better. They add some jaunty piano and a little bit of phasing, and the brass gets a bit more free-wheeling.
7. Promises, promises : 9/10 Bacharach trademarked syncopated rhythm. Quick moving, but still absorbable melody. Some nice vocal / trumpet doubling from Herb.
8. Save the Sunlight : 9/10 Laid back 70's soft groove. Herb and Lani sound good together. I like how it slides into the instrumental section. Trumpet sounds slippery good, and the accordion makes a blissful reappearance.
9. Di Da : 9/10 Steel drums and rhythm churnin'. Pool and beach-ball party for the elegant 70's jet-set.
10. Alone Again Naturally : 10/10 Great melody on the A section. The bridge part is a bit under-developed, but its weakness is overshadowed by the main melody.
11. Last Tango in Paris : 10/10 Ohh yeahhh. This tune is killer cool. Nick Ceroli's drums establish just the right groove. Congas give it some comfy cushion. Jazzy guitar struts seamlessly. Strings add subtle pinch of salt. Herb's trumpet smolders like a hot iron in embers.
12. Song for Herb : 10/10 Nostalgic, beautiful melody. Accordion perfection.

108/120 (4.5/5)
This is a solid album, his first for a quite a while. Herb sound refreshed. He and Quincy Jones fashioned together a winner. It didn't sell all that hot, but looking back, who cares how much something sells when it first came out? The point is, future generations can listen to it and appreciate its value, beyond the issue of mere money. The steel drums give it a nice tang and the accordion is a touch of genius. Sadly, John Pisano and Nick Ceroli depart the TJB after this album. .",1522195200,5

122034,898,14535,"As with millions of other people, I actually first heard a variation of this song God Gave Rock N Roll To You II by Kiss around the time I was between 12 to 15 years old via one of the Bill and Ted films (I think it was the Bill and Ted Bogus Journey film). However, I also confess that I have to credit finding out the name of the band who performed this song via a metropolitan Washington D.C. area classic rock station as that song was being played and the DJ gave informative details about this song. I enjoy this song as it seems to have an encouraging message of seeing the glass half full in life and because of the creative metaphor of describing rock n roll being given to everyone metaphorically speaking. For whatever reason the metaphor reminds me of something connected of just having fun in life and seeing the humor in life when feasible.",1522195200,5

122066,11612,612,"This song hits you square in the belly. There is something so poignant here, it makes you start missing something you never had.

Even if you usually like living in a 4 season climate, there will be gray, depressing winter days. This song makes you feel that loss somehow, even if you've never been to California and don't even want to go.

My recommendations : Play this on a gray, nasty drive to work, at a job you don't really like. Next on the playlist should be ""Monday, Monday"".

122075,19290,5779,"Within seconds of Hymn to the Pillory, the lead track from the debut album from a band that call themselves Nothing (who based on the strength of this record are anything but), the term ""shoegaze is unavoidable. For such an ephemeral micro-scene, its a powerful testimonial that in the year 2014 (two years later Cherry Red records release Still in a Dream: Story of Shoegaze 1988-1995 a five-disc genre compendium) there are groups whose trajectory is influenced by the gravitational pull of My Bloody Valentine, Slowdive, Chapterhouse and the like. There are plenty of other things the band do well however which caught the ear of someone at Relapse records, primarily purveyors of metal and noise-those being the other touchstones that comprise the bulk of Guilty of Everything. Distorted guitars provide a noisy whitewash that hangs heavy like a Bay Area fog; the hushed vocals just able to crawl under that shroud. Songs ebb and flow, creating a powerful sense of tension and release, the weight of the drums intent on some bloody-knuckled pummeling. Theres darkness everywhere you look on this record, from the cover art to Domenic Palermo whispering Im a bent nail/youve got no use for me, and your eyes are knots in the noose, but theres a pervading sense of sweetness that exists at the song's center as well; its either the poppiest record of nihilism or the most nihilistic pop record everor its both.

122083,19290,18778,"Its inconceivable that its taken this long for the pioneering work of Egyptian Lover, ne Greg Brouussard, to be anthologized; that offense has finally been rectified as the Stones Throw label, under the direction of Peanut Butter Wolf, lovingly curate this collection of genre-defining work. Clearly influenced by a disparate range of influences (strong currents of Afrika Bamabaata, Kraftwerk, and Prince runs through the 22 tracks spread across the two-discs), Broussards mix of turntable scratches, Roland 808 beats (one of the earliest programmable drum machines that became ubiquitous amongst hip-hop and electronic musicians in the 80s), and MC braggadocio (a few charmingly tame boasts of his skills as a lover are expected) that mostly inform us of his scratching skills. These tracks laid the ground work for generations of hip-hop, R n B, pop and electronic musicians for decades to come and Broussard's importance simply cannot be overstated. Egyptian Lover was renowned for working the dance floors of L.A. into a frenzy back when Miami Vice, Max Headroom, and Ronald Reagan were the stuff of water cooler banter; this collection justly brings him to a wider audience and demonstrates his undeniable influence.",1522368000,5

And after many years of searching, I uncovered the Urban Flora EP. Sure, I've had a song or two here and there that can do that, but never an entire album. My only disappointment is there isn't ""more where that came from"" I would love more and more of this. Alina Baraz has a voice that makes you pay attention and absorb every word, every note until it becomes part of you. Complemented perfectly by the talent of Galimatias that makes the beauty of her voice a hauntingly addictive sound that will have you returning over and over for a taste.

This is by far my favorite album. I hope these two team up to make more magic, I would gladly pay top dollar for that. There is nothing else like it out there (to me at least).",1522454400,5

A great beginning with the introduction of a synthesizer, with the combination of drums and that guitar sound. It is a fast song that will grab you from the start and takes you for a great 4 plus minute ride. An excellent song to rock out to. I highly recommend this very cool song.",1522454400,5

122192,56,15699,"It is so sad that Elton Joh  is set to retire from making new music, after 50 years as a mainstay, and one of the most universal and influential artists to have ever graced the stage. He has had so many highs  and achievements that no singer will ever replicate & lows that could've derailed his life & career. But through it all, his legacy will always be beyond the yellow brick road. He has had so many bountiful generations come to him, and why he is still standing strong, where others like Michael Jackson & Prince died so young. You can listen to any of Elton's songs, and they still sound better than what is on radio right now. But nevertheless, the one album many people will always go to is his 1973 double-album Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, which bridged so many divides in the music industry. The title track, Goodbye Yellow Brick Road is just very timeless to listen to, produced by the dear Gus Dudgeon, as a timeless portrait of what a musician's soul is like when he finally meets his future and runs with it for a new light at the end of the tunnel. If you are new to Elton John's music, after all these generations or a very dear hard core fan, you'll absolutely want to go to this track as one of the first to listen to.

122254,5067,12683,"School busrides home were my exposure to this song, as our bus driver tuned in old KGON up in Portland when I was a middle-schooler for this song's debut. My friend used to botch the lyrics, to sing it to me, like Plant was being gay or something... funny, I really think Mark was the one transferring some gay-ness there. Whatever... LOL... My mind wanders thinking this far back. Just heard it on a friend's playlist, and was transported right back to that schoolbus and this song on it, without Mark's commentary. LOL

Does it stand any test of time? No, not really. It really really screams 1979... I still wonder who Luke's dad is, listening to this thing (Star Wars reference, sorry).

But it still rocks. You can sing along with it in the shower and not care. Trust me, I do. ;)",1522627200,5

122286,15285,3130,"Future world music hasn't let me down quite yet, except for the 2 songs in this album I'm not a fan of, which I just hit the next button and all is well.  The 2 songs here are ""Stages of Life"" and ""Follow You or Follow Me"".  For some odd reason I can't listen to ""Stages of Life"", simply can't get through it.  Also, the song ""Follow You or Follow Me"", is the only song I've ever heard from FWM that has actual lyrics, not sure if the artist was experimenting with lyrics, but I never really cared for lyrics, which is why i got in to trailer music.  This album is still absolutely worth the purchase for 1 song alone [and the rest of the other songs], the song ""Crossroads"", a song that was WAY to short.  The first part is the usual and amazing FWM sound, and the second part is an absolutely amazing piano solo up there with the best piano I've heard that if the rest of the music didn't take you mind on a musical adventure, it's that song that will.  I pull the 750Hz, the 1.5KHz, and the 2.2KHz bands up on my equalizer and tweeters make that piano just glow with superb depth.",1522627200,5

Even when I'm not driving, this music takes my mind on an adventure, I feel as though I'm in an alternate reality where life seems worth living.

122453,19218,6226,"Herb's 16th
1. Coney Island : 9/10 Upbeat, sparkly and fun. Extra point for the trombone toots.
2. I Have Dreamed : 7/10 Nice main melody but a little too razzle-dazzle on the chorus.
3. Senor Mouse : 6/10 Fun tune, but a bit too busy for my taste.
4. Mickey : 9/10 I like Herb's pensive mood. Interesting string section on this one. Almost sounds synth, but maybe its filtered through a processer. Bob Edmondson gets a nice mopey trombone solo. Plus one for the accordion.
5. Sweet Georgia Brown : 4/10 Nothing too great about this one. And those drums are way too cymbal heavy.
6. Ratatouille : 10/10 Ah yes. Nothing like those French melodies. Melancholy verse with a misty, wistful chorus. My favorite tune on the album. Herb's trumpet sounds great with some nice interplay with the trombone.
7. Catfish : 4/10 Its got some groove to it, but the totality of it sounds uninspired. More of those cymbal-happy drums.
8. This Masquerade 9/10: Strong minor-key melody with a down and dirty groove and cool slippery trumpet read. Kind of reminiscent of his circa SRO style.
9. Carmine : 9/10 The mellow, minimal structure provides a good framework for some serious trumpet acrobatics. And that high F? Holy banana! I didn't know that was possible.
10. The Crave : 5/10 Underdeveloped, briefly rescued by that salsa rhythm.
11. Vento Bravo : 10/10 Peppery melody with cool percussion, enhanced by a very effective piano part.
12. I Belong : 7/10 Lyrics are a bit sappy, but who am I to quibble with the great Hal David? a nice instrumental portion and vocal refrain. I think I hear Lani Hall in the mix.
89/120 (3.71/5)

A little bit of a let down after the heights achieved by his previous album the year before. Nevertheless, it has a couple of really good tracks, and is a must-own for any Herb completist. After Coney Island, Herb would retire the Tijuana Brass-TJB moniker, briefly resurrecting it for one album in 1984.",1522800000,4

122580,19319,21029,"In 2005, Opera News, the prestigious monthly publication of the Metropolitan Opera Guild, began its annual naming of 'Awards' for distinguished achievement to five selected personages in the operatic community. For 2018 Vittorio Grigolo is one of these five. ""Grigolo's passion for singing developed early. At age nine he earned a spot in the Sistine Chapel Choir in Rome, the city of his upbringing. He made his La Scala debut at age twenty-three...But it was his des Grieux in Covent Garden's 2010 'Manon,' with Anna Netrebko, that launched Grigolo into super-stardom...(As) a last minute replacement...the stakes were high. The response was rapturous. It was ""the most sensational debut to be heard at Covent Garden for some time,"" reported 'The Guardian'...He has a platinum selling debut album and a Grammy nomination...At forty-one, Grigolo is in his prime...We need only sit back and watch."" (Eloise Giergerich Opera News April 2018) This album showcases ""the full range of his voice's expressive power in a collection of arias...by three giants of Italian opera: Puccini, Verdi and Donnizetti.""

122600,898,5049,I would have to say that around the time I was 18 years old and via local radio was how I first find out about this euphoric love R&B song that is Angel of Mine by Monica. I also heard this song on a various artist collection some time later by around the 1999/2000 timeframe that is the cd Totally Hits. Basically Angel of Mine by Monica is a hopeful and optimistic type of love song that appears to be about romantically being with a person who is heaven sent in life. Fortunately for me this song ended up unexpectedly becoming my actual reality by the time I was around 21 years old when I unexpectedly met my now husband.,1523145600,5

As a writer, this song catches my interest as it delves into a life situation that is far from perfect yet juicy for fictional storytelling. Basically the song appears to be about some romantic Casanova who admits to being romantically interested in more than one person.",1523145600,5

122618,898,12122,I admit finding out about this multi-faceted song that is Wild Night by John Mellencamp feat. Meshell Ndegeocello by the time I was around 14/15 years old via both the VH1 tv channel and local radio. The vocals are well timed and harmonious between both the singers (John Mellencamp and Meshell Ndegeocello) in this track. The rock song has a high spirited vibe to it and I am definitely curious to check out other versions of this song after hearing this dynamic version of Wild Night.,1523145600,5
122619,7782,9957,"This amazing song is Jewel's first and written when she was 16. It's kind of a wake-up-call about celebrity worship.  Regardless of deeper meanings this song just resonates with me.  The bouncy feel and beat just never get old and Jewel's voice is extraordinary. It's hard to believe it's over 20 years old. It still seems fresh and relevant.

Jewel nails it with her first song. No just that it stands the test of time very well. I like it a lot and i* think it deserves 5 stars.",1523145600,5

122685,16684,21036,"This was supposedly Columbia's ""revenge"" record after Dylan skipped town for the fairer climes of David Geffen's Asylum label. All of the songs are outtakes and leftovers from Dylan's two albums of 1970: the badly received Self-Portrait and the better received New Morning. Now, to tell the truth, none of these songs are great performances, and you would be a fool to say that this were even one of Bob's forgotten gems. But I'm the kind of person who has always had a soft spot for Self-Portrait, which is a tad better then music history makes it out to be. And I also like New Morning to a degree. The songs here are not that bad. I was surprised that I found Mr. Bojangles to be the best thing here. It seems no matter how much you judge and peg him to be what you think he will be at any given time, he still keeps you off guard, Protean, as they say.
  In short, this is not Dylan's worst album ever, as some have said. Down in the Groove takes that unenviable cake. But this is clearly not for newbies. God forbid someone listens to this as their intro to Bob Dylan! They'd think he had no talent whatsoever! But he does, as we all know. So the die-hard Zimmy freaks, of the Steve Jobs or Jann Wenner kind, can have this to warm their hearts. For the more rational Dylan fans, this is still worth hearing, just not over and over. You still can't get this on disc, so the download might as well suffice.-----------PEACE",1523318400,3

Dark End of the Street was recently used in the Starz series Counterpart. It fit nicely in the movie setting as a man sat on a bench on a dark street when the song started playing I felt this series had class whoever remembered that song.

122825,3739,20241,"My first experience with the performances of Sndor Vgh was over 30 years ago, when my Gramophone ""Good CD Guide"", 1992 edition, recommended the Vgh recording of Mozarts Cassations&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cassations-KV63-99/dp/B000001WLD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">(Cassations, KV63 & 99)</a>, describing them as ""Works of great charm and vitality"". Since that time, that particular recording has become one of my favorite Mozart CD's as I've built my collection with a great variety of performances of Mozart's works, and many others.

In the booklet that accompanies this box set, it's mentioned that 'of the 626 numbers in the Kchel catalogue, the directory of the works of Mozart, nearly one third are to be considered works of entertainment music, including those cultivated forms of evening entertainment whose musical expression is to be found in the terms serenade, divertimento, cassation and notturno. Mozart wrote thirty works in this instrumental genre alone, but he would have perhaps been hard pressed to provide a precise musical definition for these concepts . . .'

This collection includes many but not all of the aforementioned thirty works, along with a few selected marches, minuets, and dances. Altogether I consider this to be some of Mozart's most delightful music, lighter in style and feel than many of his more famous works, all scored for string ensemble with wind instruments appearing in perhaps a third or more of the selections here.

This collection brings together recordings made during the period 1986-1990, all recorded at various venues in Austria. The music is graceful and elegant and the performaces by Camerata Academica des Mozarteums Salzburg, led by Sndor Vgh, one of the most highly regarded chamber musicians of our age, are excellent. This box set includes an informative booklet with details of the venues and dates of each recording, and short essays on all of the works performed, written in German by Dr. Gerhard Walterskirchen and translated into English.

If you are looking for other CD's that contain this music, I can also recommend the following (I also have the second set below as part of my own collection):

  -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Serenades-for-Orchestra/dp/B00000410K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Serenades for Orchestra</a>&nbsp;is a box set of 7 CD's that was issued originally in 1990 as one of the 45 volumes in the Philips ""Complete Mozart Edition"". Performances are by  Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields Orchestra, conducted by Sir Neville Marriner.

This set includes the 7 CD's from the Serenades box above, plus&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dances-Marches/dp/B00000410N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dances & Marches</a>.

122892,19343,6200,"Normally not a fan of vocal jazz or vocal in any music in general but WOW Al hit this one album out of the ballpark in 1976.
Honestly Aqua de Beber a Brazilian classic is given the ol' Al treatment and taken to the next level with the rhythmic scatting.
Al's back up band surprise, surprise consists of 1/2 of the Crusaders including Larry Carlton! No question with such talent in the studio what you get is a treat for the ears. The vibe here and thru-out the recording is down-tempo(you get lots of electric piano and warm Fender jazz bass a favorite with this listener!) and at least to this listener is on a parallel level with what Michael Franks was doing at the time. The recording is what suffers tho. Its a little dull on the high end frequencies and quiet flat I guess that's what to be expected consider major labels where just cranking the cds out in the 80s and 90s without any thoughts about decent remastering.
If you enjoy the popier side of jazz with nice hooks and a mellow airy Sunday morning vibe this is a gem of a disc to add to your collection. Al was an impression musician and chose to work with the best as only the best would suffice.",1523664000,4

122953,6611,13559,"ULTIMATE 5TH DIMENSION: Call them the black MAMAS & THE PAPAS if you want...unbelievably, THE 5TH DIMENSION sounded even more vanilla than that undisputed pinnacle of MOTOWN crossover acts, DIANA ROSS & THS SUPREMES. Front woman MARILYN MCCOO's beauty contest looks and cool vocal flair, coupled with the group's knack for covering some of the best song craftsmen of their era (LAURA NYRO, JIMMY WEBB, etc.) resulted in an unbroken string of Top 40 gems from the late sixties through the early seventies. MCCOO's husband BILLY DAVIS JR. succeeded in piercing the gang's RNB bubblegum with a delicious blast of unhinged gospel grit on the second half of HAIR medley AQUARIUS/LET THE SUN SHINE IN...but for the most part, the 5D were as safe and reliable as THREE DOG NIGHT or THE GRASS ROOTS. The euphoric highlights rounded up on VERY BEST (UP, UP & AWAY, ONE LESS BELL TO ANSWER, STONED SOUL PICNIC) are plentiful here, from five talented performers more than capable of taking pristine pop vocal harmony to another dimension.

123028,1577,9004,"This is a cool song from Debbie Deb, I first heard this song I was at the skating rink. It has banging beat and a great song to listen and dance too. What I like most about the song is the background beat, it is totally 80's.",1524009600,5

123039,5777,3165,"One of the great iconic folk/rock songs of '60s. One of the best songs ever written by Paul Simon. Considering the list of great songs he has written over the decades that certainly says a lot. With his partner Art Garfunkel they created a mood and tone to the song that was a commentary about society in the mid-1960s as America was in the middle of a political and cultural turmoil. Their harmonization, which was always something they were well known for, is exceptional in this recording. If you are looking to download classic music from the '60s ""Sound Of Silence"" needs to be one to add to the play list.",1524009600,5
123040,1577,16343,"I first heard this song on a T.V. commercial, I loved the lyrics and the background music  I had to have it. I believe this s the first song I heard of hers and I wasn't disappointed. It has great synthesizer sound, that says Moonzz. I believe some of you have heard this song, but if you haven't the MP3 sample will be music to your ears.",1524009600,5
123041,408,8779,Fun song,1524009600,5
123042,1577,18314,"A great song from a band from the late 90's. This was probably one of their best hits, it's a great hit I think everyone can relate too. Listen to the MP3 you will like this song, I would recommend this hit to everyone, especially hairband lovers",1524009600,5
123043,10138,21054,"This is an album of science fiction comedy songs by Sheldon Allman.  Despite the title of the album, these aren't all ""folk songs"".  There are a few folk songs, but there is also rock and roll, jazz and even opera.  The best known song nowadays is ""Crawl Out Through The Fallout"", due to its inclusion in the video game Fallout 4.  That's a great song, but the other songs are funny, too.  They are about what people in 1960 imagined the future would be like.  Of course, all those predictions about life in the 21st Century ended up being wrong, but these novelty songs are still amusing.",1524009600,4

123049,19172,13850,"Great great album from Scott Henderson and crew. Henderson is one of the absolute best guitarists out there, and this recording gives ample proof of this fact. Got something for everyone here. Travis Carlton (bass) and Alan Hertz (drums) provide excellent backup to Scott's clear and precise playing. I thought I detected a hint of boogie on the first track ""Church Of Xotic Dance"". Most of this album is straight forward and dynamic with a couple of slower more mellow jazz tunes. Overall an A+++ grade .",1524096000,5
123050,2535,11122,"It's quite easy to approach His throne with a list of requests, complaints and likewise thanks and praises. But we really should listen first; speak second. Hard to do so this song is a much appreciated reminder from a great talent.",1524096000,5

With the exception of cuts 7-8, two takes of the Oscar Peterson Trio captured live playing On Green Dolphin Street, these are cuts from two of my favorite vinyl recordings of the late fifties (cut 9) and very early sixties (cuts 1-6).

On the Very Tall cuts, Peterson and Jackson play together with the rock firm rhythm section of bassist Brown and drummer Thigpen, and they all play in the same direction. That wasn't a certainty with the Peterson of that day, who (in my opinion) tended to over-embellish when he played, using too many notes and churning up aa funky, bluesy feeling that felt ersatz, not real at times. Here probably because he was playing with the real thing in Jacksonhe swings more directly. His solos are clean, not cluttered. Jackson is as always sheer pleasure: the guy did ballads as well as he did bop lines and blues, an all-purpose musical master. These four guys sound like they were having fun. Of the six songs from the original album, two are blues or bluesy (the second is John Browns Body, a funky remake of The Battle Hymn of the Republic), a third is an up-tempo rendition of Dolphin, the fourth a ballad Heartstrings, fifth Nat Adderleys funkmeister Work Song, and last and least successful, a -time rendition of A Wonderful Guy. Then come the true trio cuts of Dolphin. And then a mid-sized band version of Heartstrings again, from Jacksons most successful album of the 50s, Plenty, Plenty Soul. It features an absolutely stunning presentation of the theme by Jackson, followed by a lovely solo ditto, and then another gem of a solo by Cannonball Adderley on alto.

It might have been nice to have more variety in songs played three versions of Dolphin, two of Heartstringsbut when the music being played is of this high a quality, who cares? This isn't an essential album but its a very good one, which shows what old pros can do when they convene just to groove together.",1524355200,4

123208,7871,8706,"Count me among the many who were sufficiently dismayed at My Morning Jackets strangely simultaneous evolution from dreamweavers to self-imitators around the exact time Evil Urges arrived on the grating screech of overreach. I kind of had a falling out with the band then, made a little bit of an effort to get into Circuital, but I had resigned myself to never hearing much of the soaring, celestial mystery you hear in classics past. Its cool for a band to evolve, sometimes you just evolve in a different direction than they do. No biggie.

The Waterfall is more of a continuation of my glancing interest in what they're up to, combined with a fatalistic pessimism that weve seen the very best they can do so far.  There are some tracks here, however, that are not only among their very best, but take the bus in a strange new direction that was unforeseen, intriguing, and rather dark in a good way. The first order of business is to get past the first two tracks, which are embarrassingly bad and borderline rival even the most cheeseball moments of Evil Urges.  Believe has absolutely nothing to say and nowhere to go, and Compound Fracture wallows in genericness, a real stinker.  But from there on out, prepare to get your wig blown back by a band on a mission, with the next two tracks being back to back classics, incorporating a wide-eyed, almost childlike wonderment, flirting with the listener, an exhausting journey that reaffirms they are capable of still producing some astounding music. Putting the hypnotic qualities of repetition to use on Like the Rivers middle section and The Waterfalls insistent vocal hook, you honestly don't want those two songs to end. Spring finally does something mysterious and uncharacteristic with Jim James obsession with dance rock, and Thin Line and Tropics throttle way up on a soulful groove that feels startling, uncomfortable, real.

My high expectations for a real fine closer were dashed, and the album lands where it started at jammy mediocrity. I suppose the one thing we can always expect from My Morning Jacket from now on is inconsistency... Ill take it.",1524441600,3

I have every studio Tristan and I go back to Solti and Von Karajan for different reasons.

123337,18491,21065,"Vinyl Edition:  I love the vinyl mastering here, it sounds SO good.  Very powerful over tower speakers.  If you are a fan of Scott Traviss double-bass-drum attack you are in luck, vinyl is the way to enjoy this album.

Angel of Retribution is a very strong album; melodic, hard, and varying in tone and mood.  I like Rob Zs production, he worked on a few Halford solo albums that I really enjoy.  The albums first disc contains the more harder, powerful songs, the second disc is more introspective and also were many fans feel Priest have laid an egg; Lochness.  I think Lochness sounds way better on vinyl than on CD but still not crazy about the chorus.

Included is an MP3 download, which is good since Amazon does not offer Auto-Rip for Angel of Retribution vinyl.  My only complaint would be that there is not lamination or a glossy surface on the album jacket which may help to protect the artworks longevity like CBS records of the past.  I would advise putting the album in a plastic sleeve.

Very happy to finally be able to buy this album on vinyl for under $50 !",1524700800,5

123346,898,1542,I admit to only first hearing this dazzling and empowering song that is I Wont Back Down by Tom Petty by the time I was around 26/27 years old via local radio(around 2006/2007). I feel uplifted each time I hear this gleaming classic rock song because from my perspective as a writer I Wont Back Down appears to be a unique music message about having courage through both challenging and positive/good times for the rest of ones life and beyond.,1524700800,5

The vocals are classic, too, with that distinctive little twist on ""by now"" that she shows on many songs. Love the tonal color of her voice and the hint of an accent. C'mon, Lily.

123474,1190,20065,"Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers were already seasoned veterans by the time the show at My Father's Place in Roslyn, NY was recorded for radio broadcast in November 1977. The first album by the band had been in shops since 1976 and the band was about to start recording it's second album. For most of 1976 and 1977 Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers were on the road and right in the middle of the Punk craze from England, Tom Petty and his band played a combination of 1960's rock music and 1970's punk and found that audiences from the get-go could not get enough of it.

This show from Long Island in the club finds our heroes right in their element in front a small but happy crowd of foks. There are already hits and fan-favorites featured in the set. ""American Girl"" ""I Need To Know"" ""Listen To Her Heart"" & ""Breakdown."" and those songs are paired up here the cover songs ""Shout"" ""Route 66"" and ""Jaguar & Thunderbird."" The band is already a powerhouse with Ron Blair's bass guitar right up in the mix.
Benmont Tench, tickles his ivory keys and aids much weight to this band. Stan pounds those drums with fury and Mike Campbell is a beast from opening chords right through till the end of the show. Tom, is the leader of this party and he gives the people what they want.

If you have wondered what Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers sounded like in the early days this collection of great live music gives you the goods.
The road would get larger as Tom Petty would play a few more big gigs after this night in Long Island in 1977.

123609,13446,226,"This is an album with Keith Sweat's greatest hits that I bought as a Valentine's day gift for myself, and I'm still enjoying it. I find Keith Sweat is a great singer and very talented, and this album with his greatest hits shows that. I also have an album called LSG, a group album with Keith singing with Johnny Gill and the late Gerald Levert who passed away in 2006, and that's also my favorite album with Keith Sweat singing. From that album LSG, there's a favorite song that I like with Keith singing the background vocals, and it's called ""Love Hurts"". A couple of times when I first heard that song with Keith singing with LSG, I happened to hear what an amazing voice Keith had and how great he sounded. So something right there told me that I should buy this album with Keith Sweat's greatest hits, so that I can really know his music, instead of just listening to him sing with LSG. And there's another one song from that album that appears to be on this album with Keith's greatest hits, and it's called ""My Body"". Even at the time when I first started listening to LSG with Keith Sweat, I didn't have any original music or albums with him singing by himself, so I also thought that buying this album with his greatest hits would be great. I already do have one original album by Johnny Gill and with his music, and I already do have seven original albums by the late Gerald Levert, including the album LSG. I actually even have a copy of that album LSG burned on a CD from the original, and I would play the burned copy whenever I listen to this album with Keith's music. I also find that Johnny Gill and the late Gerald Levert are also great singers. That album LSG even brings back memories of Gerald Levert from when he was alive singing with Keith Sweat and Johnny Gill, and LSG stands for Levert-Sweat-Gill, the last names of each artist, including Keith Sweat.

Other than that, this album is still a a great collection with Keith Sweat's music.",1525132800,4

123648,4398,13539,"I'm an old school metal fan that's new to Stryper.  I got pulled in after listening to their newest album, God Damn Evil, and all I can say about Fallen is...WOW!!!  What a great album!  Talk about addictive!  I can listen to this album over and over from start to finish.  Like I said, I'm new to Stryper, so older fans of the band might not see it the same way, but Yahweh is one of the most original sounding, amazing songs that I've ever heard.  The church-like ""Yahweh"" at the beginning followed by an incredible riff and then it just gets better from there.  I can't get that song out of my head.  My kids are getting tired of me singing it around the house (probably due to my ""singing"" more than anything).  But after that song, there are so many other great songs on here, such as Sorry, Lost, Big Screen Lies, King of Kings...you name it, they're all good.  Stryper isn't as heavy as many of the groups I listen to (Megadeth, Slayer, Kreator, C.O.C...to name but a few), but they more than make up for it in song craft and melody, not to mention an uplifting message (and some nice riffs to boot).  I really like this album and I'm finding myself really liking Stryper as well.  If you haven't listened to this yet...what are you waiting for?  Check it out!",1525219200,5

123699,898,6312,"I reluctantly confess that I actually became interested in the Devil Inside song by Inxs around the time I was 8 years old via either television andor radio and less than a year after getting into other types of romantic 80s songs ( Heaven on Earth by Belinda Carlisle, Come Go With Me by Expose etc.)  The title of this controversial push the envelope song pretty much symbolizes potential duality of human nature. Despite the title, this song does not seem to endorse evil rather I take the devil inside as more a music message of encouraging a person to make friends with their shadowy side andor transform the shadowy side towards a beneficial way to enjoy life more rather than simply trying to completely ignore ones spiritual shadowy side.

123704,898,1767,"Multiple people in my life who have known me for a while know that I am a fan of multiple songs by Madonna and Angel by Madonna happens to be one of the one of a kind songs by her that I enjoy. Angel seems to be a spiritually healing music tune about meeting someone who has a blissful/joyful influence on ones life. The lyrics of you came when I wished for you within the song indicates meeting someone in your life who seems to be almost sent from heaven in ones life. The lyrics just now I realize within part of the song seems to me to be a positive dedication mini story about noticing after getting to know the person how they are an angel. Fortunately for me, I consider my husband of 14 years an angel in my life and I am frequently reminded from his positive example on  how to have both a forgiving heart and a modest spirit. He is very modest on multiple things that I feel he deserves to give himself more value on yet that is something obviously for another post.",1525305600,5

123740,11298,2755,"Coming into fame as a comedic actor, Jamie Foxx has expanded his horizons to take on a variety of dramatic roles. As a singer who's taken the opportunity to perform in works such as the musical film 'Dreamgirls', his interests include neo-soul styles as well as club-focused hip-hop and even a bit of new jack swing. This album doesn't just bring him together with collaborators such as Kanye West and T.I., though, but frequently buries his talented voice with a lot of slick production.

Foxx's scattershot approach could've made for a well-rounded album, but it feels more like a mixed bag than anything. Some tracks have a particular appeal to them while others seem more average than anything. ""Blame It"" became a major radio hit at the time of release, although as a pop rap single it's nothing special. Foxx's vocal abilities shine far better in songs such as the Boyz II Men style emotional ballads ""Rainman"" and ""Why"", the two of which alone make the album worth picking up.",1525392000,4

123802,3308,20537,"I've accumulated quite a few complete sets of the Mozart piano sonatas over the years, including those from Arrau, Eschenbach, Kraus, de Larrocha, Perlemuter, and Wurtz, and I'm happy to say that Ingrid Haebler's is among the best of the bunch. Her approach often leans towards understatement, but I was prepared for this having listened for decades to her memorable recordings of a batch of Mozart violin sonatas with Henryk Szeryng; but she breaks out in some of the bigger sonatas (e.g. K. 284), even though she doesn't paint the huge canvases Arrau and Richter put up in their live traversals (see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Claudio-Arrau-Live-at-Tanglewood/dp/B00CHFOCEG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Claudio Arrau Live at Tanglewood</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Richter-Complete-Decca-Philips-DG-Recordings/dp/B00N9MWVVW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Richter: Complete Decca, Philips & DG Recordings</a>). Her K 311, to name one example, may sound decidedly undernourished beside theirs, but then she's delivering poetry from a recording studio not drama from a recital platform. The best way to describe her playing is that it's idiomatic, consistent and intimate, and never lapses into the routine politeness that Alicia de Larrocha is susceptible to, nor the relentless forward momentum of Lili Kraus. The recorded sound is also exceptional.",1525478400,5

123812,898,7402,This push the envelope rock song Synchronicity II by the Police is a one of a kind classic rock song that penetrated through the core of my soul when I first heard it on local radio for reasons I wish I could fully explain. I admit that I still have yet to make out the full meaning of Synchronicity II. The best I can guess out of this keep me guessing type of classic rock is that Synchronicity by the Police seems to be a musical story type of tune about different life experiences being more than just mere coincidences and possibly marked by serendipity.,1525478400,5

123820,898,6711,I admit that even though I first heard this classic rock song Blaze of Glory by Jon Bon Jovi as a teenager that I ended up remembering this quintessential rock song after recently hearing it on local radio. I understand that the meaning of this song is definitely going to vary by whoever hears it yet I take Blaze of Glory to be a powerful tune of someone admitting that they would like to end their life on a high note if possible (the part of the song where the lyrics are written to address God may obviously suggest an understanding andor awareness that when andor how a person dies is obviously not always under their control).,1525478400,5

123983,1108,20463,"""A Goofy Movie"" is a criminally underloved Disney film -- while not one of their masterpieces, it's still highly enjoyable and a beloved piece of '90s nostalgia.  And it had a surprisingly catchy soundtrack that, while again not one of Disney's most iconic, is still a lot of fun and has some quite memorable pieces.

By far the two most memorable songs on this soundtrack are ""Stand Out"" and ""I2I,"" pop numbers with a very Michael-Jackson-esque flavor to them and that tie in to key themes of the movie -- being yourself and learning how to get along with those closest to you.  ""After Today"" is a fun crowd-song number that probably exemplifies most kids' reactions to the onset of summer vacation, and ""On the Open Road"" is a, well, goofy and fun number sung by Goofy and his son Max as they set off on a roadtrip together.  ""Nobody Else But You,"" another duet by Goofy and Max, is a more mellow song but thoughtfully ties up the themes of the movie.  ""Lester's Possom Park"" is probably a ""throwaway"" track, but still a rare but welcome bit of self-depreciation as Disney makes fun of its own goofy theme park numbers.

The orchestral tracks, in my opinion, aren't quite as memorable as the vocal songs, but those who enjoy soundtrack scores will probably appreciate them.  For the songs alone, though, I'd say this album is worth your time, especially if you grew up with this film.",1525910400,4

124005,11298,13126,"Somehow managing to be challenging, dramatic, funny, interesting, patriotic, reflective, touching, and more all at once, the musical sensation seems to have drowned in hype but just about every word is earned. This look at the life and times of Alexander Hamilton doesn't merely make for a great story. It's legitimately informative, and the ability to see the different sides of individuals often subject to simple portrayals is quite nice.

Aaron Burr in particular was an ambitious opportunist with fluctuating loyalties, to the point that he eventually explored taking up arms against the country that he'd previously defended. The musical doesn't let him fall into the role of a cackling, mustache-twirling villain. Instead, it takes a broader look at the man. Another selling point is the incorporation of soul music traditions, hip-hop stylings, modern pop vibes, and the like into standard show tunes. All that helps make the musical into something worth listening to over and over again. The album itself is truly a delight to have.",1525996800,5

Sound recording's not the best, but that's the point. These young fellows had a gizmo that allowed them to multitrack, just like the Beatles! Most musicians are, to some degree, gadget nerds. I have to wonder where they got the money. R Fripp has reported that they lived ""in the most abject conditions"". Extensive liner notes, which weren't really interesting enough for me to read carefully. I think this stuff must have been in the hands of Peter Giles who, like Elmer Snowden, is one of the great losers (not a value judgment) in recent music history.",1525996800,4

This has been an awesome addition to my library and for those few of us who love this music were are fortunate to be able to buy 111 pieces of the world's finest music for 99 cents.

124318,7472,21096,"Featuring the classic original score for the film The Day The Earth Stood Still is limited to 3000 copies. While this is a nice release and th booklet is terrific, there are some flaws.

First up the good stuff are that these are the original session tapes recorded in mono for the film as well as rehearsals (where Bernard Herrmann remarks about a so-so performance this isn't linoleum as he has Alfred Newman (who was conducting along with his brother so Herrmann could check the recording levels in the booth) conduct the orchestrate. We also hear outtakes of more extreme versions of the themin performances.

Unfortunately, due to the age of the tapes, there is noticeable distortion on all the tracks that could not be eliminated from the meticulously restored tapes.

If you can get past the distortion (which usually happens during crescendos or during particularly loud passages), this is a fine restoration of the original tapes (perhaps the distortion was caused by tape bleed through). If you want this in stereo and without the distortion, Id recommend Joel McNeelys re-recording done at Abbey Road.",1526688000,2

The vocalist Cynda Williams nails it and makes it her own.  It adds a dose of hip-hop which was a force that could not be ignored in the era...Gang Starr does a great job.,1526860800,5

124395,18270,336,"In my continuing quest to find large, outstanding compilations of classical music at bargain prices, I have been very successful, unearthing several Big Box MP3 albums from The Bach Guild for 99 cents. They include Big Beethoven Box, Big Handel Oratorio Box, and others. So far, I have found each of them a delightful listening experience.

I recently added Little Big Box: Bach Orchestral Music to my digital library. This album is very good. It features over four hours of Johann Sebastian Bachs orchestral music, including all of his Brandenburg Concertos and Orchestral Suites, as well as several concertos. All are performed with a high degree of artistry by a variety of world-class, but lesser known musicians.

Although I think Little Big Box: Bach Orchestral Music certainly upholds the high standards of the other Big Box sets I own, I don't think it quite rises to the level of the finest albums of Bachs orchestral music, many of which I also own. (Those include: Brandenburg Concertos and Orchestral Suites by Trevor Pinnock and the English Concert; Keyboard Concertos by Murray Perahia and the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields; and Oboe Concertos by Christian Hommel and the Cologne Chamber Orchestra.)

The performances found on Little Big Box: Bach Orchestral Music appear to date from the mid-20th century. They feature various world-class orchestras, conductors, chamber ensembles, and solo instrumentalists, all of whom demonstrate a very high degree of artistry and musicianship. However, these performances seem (to my ears, anyway) to lack some of the driving tempos and pungency found in later historically informed performances of Bachs music that I prefer. Although these are mostly older stereophonic recordings, the audio quality of the entire album is clean, crisp, and well balanced.

Despite my minor concerns about Little Big Box: Bach Orchestral Music I still think it is a good sampler of Johann Sebastian Bachs orchestral music. With its excellent performances, well-rounded musical selections, and good audio quality, and with its low price of 99 cents, I can easily recommend this album.",1526860800,4

124526,1805,21102,"As an album Young Man Follow flags in energy and it hurts the release.  FOF isn't a band that is going to rock your ears off; never has been.  But FOF has put out some good and inventive and thoughtful pop-rock (Ive especially liked their approach to the percussive elements in their songs) that can break into meditation and then open up into exultation.  The title track, which happens to be the lead track, does this nicely within its own framework and the song is a good one.  Its exciting, has a spirit of adventure and of approach, and interludes of reflection.  But if you're like me you will listen to the rest of the release and realize that they put their best up front and didn't leave enough for the back end.  The second track is an example of how this can happen as it starts off on a slow tempo and, unfortunately, uninteresting draw and takes too long to get to an exuberant chorus that then overstays its welcome.  I don't dislike the song but I find that I cant embrace it.  Oh.  There are also bells on this album.  Far fewer than I think but they are distracting when they come up and I feel there are too many bells.

I read that Eric Owyoung, FOFs main man, created this project with care about what the listener would take away from it.  He wants us to feel comforted by it, warmed even if only by knowing that there are others out there that care or that have gone through hard times too.  The atmosphere of the album is more on the ethereal side as if most of it wants to cradle you, which is cool.  But it would have also been cool to conjure different pressures and atmospheres and allow the lyrical contents and emotional tones to connect more to and with us than just one primary mood.  Please don't get me wrong; most of the songs are fine standing on their own and are perhaps best described as pleasant.  We all need that from time to time.  And perhaps this album is better when you take one song at a time rather than listening to the entire run straight through?  I don't know.  Im just used to more creativity coming out of this outfit, and a bit more verve.",1527292800,3

It's an album of songs Paul personally likes arranged in an order he found pleasing. As a glimpse into Paul's own personal assessment of his music it succeeds admirably. Of course this isn't going to be an album for everybody. Somebody is going to get their nose bent out of shape because their personal favorites aren't included and yes, a couple of these songs are not so good but that's to be expected from somebody with just the sheer bulk of songs Paul has recorded. For me if I'm giving Paul a serious listen I would never go to any collection but rather to the original albums themselves but as Paul said in describing this himself is it's a great overview for a long car ride.",1527292800,4

124538,1805,18674,"Shinedowns vocalist Brent Smith and guitarist Zach Myers strip down and unplug to cover several classics and their choices are surprising and broad ranging from seminal punk (The Clashs London Calling), blues (Kenny Wayne Shepherds Blue On Black), old Rhythm and Blues (Otis Reddings Sitting On the Dock of the Bay), heavy metal (Metallicas Nothing Else Matters), and alternative (Soul Asylums Runaway Train).  The categories are even more varied if you count the second release which includes contemporary pop (Adeles Someone Like You) and some old school 80s rock (Phil Collins In the Air Tonight).  There are ten songs over two releases and this first release accounts for six of the tracks.  All are live recordings but the production and levels are so good, so crisp, with audience volume and fuzz kept to a bare minimum that it might as well be a studio recording.  I like that, and another thing too, with Smith introducing each songs name and artist before they put the song out in a solid and clear presentation.  Smiths vocals are powerful but he doesnt try to overreach, or to make the song his own, or add too much to it.  The translations are pretty simple and straightforward.

For some reason they decided to split up their Acoustic Sessions into two parts and the first entry  is even more diversified but if I had to pick a favorite between the two I would go with this second, shorter session due to the strength of the Adele coververy moving and strong and I don't even listen to Adele; does anyone else want to see these two maybe perform a duet?and PJs impassioned tune.  I was surprised that my least favorite track was the one I anticipated being my favorite as I have always really enjoyed the slow-burn power of In the Air Tonight but with the percussion and in spite of their best efforts to provide that rising punch its just not there.

I was blown away by the shear intensity of this album and the fact that they modernized the sound of a lot of bands from the late 90s and early 00s. This is definitely an alternative metal album, but it is really heavy at times. Its also has some very good lyrics and even some spoken poetry to really add to the diversity.

124630,7245,1041,"In 1979, a double LP, simply crimson with gold leaf lettering SinatraJobim Sessions found its way into more than a few rock and jazz boomer collections.  Antonio Carlos Jobim had gone from Brazilian Bossa Nova legend to a big name regular in the Creed Taylor CTI Jazz stable.  I was one of those who picked it up even though Frank Sinatra was my Fathers music, he was still cool and probably more so in the 70s because he went from covering My Music (Heres to you Mrs. Robinson, ooby dooby doo) to doing some stand up appreciable real jazz and resembling the towering mighty man who fronted Harry James and Tony Dorseys orchestras and rose to superstardom in the 50s and made cool-jazz music with His Highness Basie.  The only way to lay your hands on this prize was as an import in places like Tower Records or if you knew of its existence you could have your mom and pop record store order it for you at a price.  Only Jobim fans and extremely serious Sinatra fans knew about it from articles.  The other way to get this material was to back order the old Francis Albert Sinatra & Antonio Carlos Jobim (1967) and Sinatra & Company (1971) but you were still left without three of the tracks they did together: ""Bonita"", ""Sabi"", and ""Off Key (Desafinado)"".  The 10 track Francis Albert Sinatra & Antnio Carlos Jobim, arranged and conducted by Claus Ogerman, accompanied by a studio orchestra, is very nice but the real prize was the eagerly sought other half of the Sessions arranged by Deodato (stable-mate of Jobim in CTI, and 2nd greatest Brazilian jazz man after Jobim alongside the Joo Gilberto family) and conducted by Morris Stoloff.  Of particular note: Francis Albert Sinatra & Antnio Carlos Jobim was nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, but lost to the Beatles Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.  Darn those Beatles!  Sinatra and Jobim worked together for a final time in 1994 on Duets II, recording a cover of ""Fly Me to the Moon"" if you want to be complete you will have to get that one too!

The original collection of Sinatra & Jobim tracks on their collaborations included two recordings which do not actually feature Jobim, ""Drinking Again"" and ""Manh De Carnaval.  SINATRA/JOBIM: THE COMPLETE REPRISE RECORDINGS does not include them, instead you get all 20 original recordings featuring both artists in their work of genius together.  As Amazon does not see fit to give you the track listings on the CD, here is the full lineup with credits:

1. The Girl from Ipanema (Antnio Carlos Jobim, Norman Gimbel, Vincius de Moraes)  3:20
2.  Dindi (Ray Gilbert, Jobim, Aloysio de Oliveria)  3:31
3.  Change Partners (Irving Berlin)  2:43

6.  If You Never Come to Me (Jobim, Gilbert, de Oliveira)  2:11
7.  How Insensitive (Jobim, Gimbel, de Moraes)  3:18
8.  I Concentrate on You (Cole Porter)  2:39
9.  Baubles, Bangles and Beads (Robert Wright, George Forrest, Alexander Borodin)  2:36
10.  Once I Loved (O Amor em Paz) (Jobim, Gilbert, de Moraes)  2:38
11.  The Song of the Sabia (Sabi) (Jobim, Chico Buarque, Gimbel)  3:40
12.  Drinking Water (Agua de Beber) (de Moraes, Jobim, Gimbel)  2:37
13.  Someone to Light Up My Life (de Moraes, Jobim, Lees)  2:40
14.  Triste (Jobim)  2:42
15.  This Happy Madness (Estrada Branca) (de Moraes, Jobim, Lees)  2:57
16.  One Note Samba (Samba de Uma Nota So) (Jobim, Mendona)  2:22
17.  Don't Ever Go Away (Por Causa de Voc) (Gilbert, Dolores Duran, Jobim)  2:30
18.  Wave (Jobim)  3:21
19.  Off Key"" (Desafinado) (Lees, Jobim, Mendona)  3:09

124640,10941,12208,"I happened upon The Fratellis late to the game!  But, ""better late than never!""  They're very talented & innovative, changing-it-up song by song (not only from one release to another) keeping your interest piqued!  I did go in reverse, getting ""In Your Own Sweet Time"" first (reviewed separately) & do like that one better, but I do like EYES WIDE, TONGUE TIED!

Track #1 ""Me and the Devil"" and Track #3 ""Baby Don't You Lie to Me!"" have a similar sound & they're both highlights.  Track #6 ""Dogtown"" is a little weird.  It begins sounding a bit like a faster Beatles' ""Come Together"", but then goes into what reminds me of 'circus music' & both repeat through song.  That 'circus' music I find more than a little odd & for me the song would have been one of my favorites on EYES WIDE, TONGUE TIED without it - But, again, name of the game for The Fratellis seems to be experimentation & with that, some will work exremely well & some not at all.  And, they have many more in the ""works extremely well"" category!!  Track #2 ""Imposters"" (Little by Little) doesn't work for me, although it does showcase their variety, once more.  Guitar's much too ""twangy"" a.k.a. country-western for me.  Track #8 is a really pleasant, beautiful ballad & jumped into a favorite immediately, which is a complete surprise for me, since I don't usually care much for ballads & by 2018, that's a particularly nice revelation! On Track #9 ""Getting Surreal"" The Fratelli's pump it up a notch!

I didn't go with the deluxe version, because even on my most favorite recordings, I don't appreciate acoustic so much.  I imagine EYES WIDE, TONGUE TIED is a must-have for Fratellis fans & I think it's an excellent jumping-in point for newcomers, as there's something enjoyable for everyone.  I would liken The Fratellis, especially on EYES WIDE, TONGUE TIED to a 21st Century Dire Straits, as they were uber-successful completely disregarding (1980's) trends & doing their own exceptionally talented thing.  The Fratellis don't sound like Dire Straits...the similarity lies in bucking trendy music, having a vast, devoted following & being hugely popular & successful!",1527811200,3

124696,16684,10442,"This is a mammoth set of the complete organ works of Johann Sebastian Bach, (or at least all that was known to have been written by Bach at the time) played by the late Walter Kraft, who tragically died in a hotel fire back in 1977. This set is really good technically, but decent in sound quality, having been recorded back in the 50's and 60's. E. Power Biggs, Friederich Walcha, Simon Preston and others have made better Bach organ music recordings, which are all out there of course. Often those are quite expensive. However, you get the whole motherlode here for only about ten dollars! So, price wise, you can't go wrong if you are a Bachaphile. Let's just say I give it 3 stars for recording quality and performance quality, and 5 stars for all of that great music at an inexpensive price. So that rounds out to 4 stars. Just like the Vox Box set of the complete keyboard works, played by Martin Galling on harpsichord, Vox tends to get all of this stuff out at a pretty good price. And they have done it here too-----------PEACE
BTW-Be careful. This set contains over 15 hours of music, so it might overload your cloud.",1528070400,4

Bombastically beautiful, this joyful recording is the love child between classic power metal and Disney's The Gummi Bears theme. An exhilarating, sparkling dragon ride that lifts your soul to breathless heights. Catchy ear-worm melodies that make your heart sing long after you turn off the music. Best of all is Twilight Force's uninhibited, unapologetic nerdiness (they seriously role-play elves, sorcerers and knights at all times!), the end-all metal band for any passionate lover of fantasy a la World of Warcrarft. Sure there's cheese galore, but as one person commented, these guys don't take themselves seriously, but they take their music VERY seriously - it is seriously top-notch, with jaw-dropping power metal vocals and riffs. I have barely listened to this a week and it already in my top 10 favorite albums of all time. Jump on a dragon, draw your sword, blast this music, and let your soul soar!",1528243200,5

124807,898,1696,"I confess that I was actually stationed in North Island California when I first heard this emotionally soothing song that is Somewhere I Belong by Linkin Park by the 2004 timeframe. A coworker kindly made a copy of the Linkin Park cd Meteora music collection from a computer and Somewhere I Belong happens to be one of my favorite songs from the Meteora collection even to this day. I rationally and intuitively understand that Somewhere I Belong is one of those songs that has a different meaning depending on who hears it andor who created it. However, I take Somewhere I Belong to be a constructive tune about simply wanting to feel andor be where spiritually, personally, andor psychologically belonging can happily occur (simply guessing from the lyrics I want to heal could imply various levels of healing-emotionally psychological spiritual etc.).",1528502400,5

124815,7472,15034,"""The Epic Archive"" releases were originally digital downloads only from Sony so it's good to see Real Gone putting out the physical copy of this album on CD. My only problem with the entire series is that, for example, Volume 1 consisted of songs that appeared on the expanded editions of the early albums. The purpose of these releases were to- originally at least- compliment the ""Sex"" boxed set but, since then, that set has largely been supplement by the reissues of the proper albums with bonus tracks and the complete albums boxed set.

As we move along in the series from two to three, there are going to be more songs that didn't make either set because Sony stopped the remasters with bonus tracks (although the remasters did get released in the boxed set and as digital downloads as well). This set sounds fine--Vic Anesini does his usual magic with the tracks making them sound great with nice dynamics but also staying true to what the intended sound was for these when released (not necessarilyl the same as how the mastertapes themselves sound as, sometimes things go awry when an album is prepared for mastering).

The set has a terrific booklet with comments fromvarious combinations of Rick, Bun and Tom on each respective track. While the first set of this series was nice, there's nothing really on there that wasn't available digtially elsehwere. Here, on the other hand, we get rarities, b-sides and soundtrack recordings that don't appear elsewhere. There are some exceptions of course as, for example, the tracks from the ""Found All The Parts"" EP have been available as bonus tracks on the expanded ""All Shook Up"" (produced by George Martin) and as a separate EP in the boxed set. If we had eliminated tracks that appeared elsewhere, this set could have been pared down to a single double CD set rather than three individual releases.

This will be essential for most Cheap Trick fans but keep in mind you are getting duplication here of tracks on other releases you may own.",1528588800,5

124847,10506,17222,"The fact that Cyndi Lauper can make Country Music palatable to someone like me who doesnt normally listen to it is a testament to her likeability as a vocalist. There are some great tunes here and this collection plays better than the snooze fest that was found on the AT LAST CD.

FUNNEL OF LOVE has Cyndis trademark vocal tics and hiccups and they work wonderfully in this context.

DETOUR sounds like it was recorded in the 1950s by Kitty Wells.

MISTY BLUE is a dynamic vocal performance, period. This and HARD CANDY CHRISTMAS are probably the best ones on the CD.

WALKNG AFTER MIDNIGHT is one of the weak links only because no one can sing this like Patsy Cline and the arrangement isn't as atmospheric as the original; the lack of male backup is detrimental. I FALL TO PIECES works much better even though its a carbon-copy version of Patsys.

HEARTACHES BY THE NUMBER has a vocal that is typical Cyndi and an average arrangement.

END OF THE WORLD is less cringe-worthy than the syrupy Skeeter Davis version.

YOURE THE REASON OUR KIDS ARE UGLY with Vince Gill is a cute duet with lots of funny banter and it works better than the drowsy Willie Nelson duet on the country-blues number NIGHT LIFE.

I WANNA BE A COWBOYS SWEETHEART is noteworthy for the yodeling if nothing else.",1528761600,4

124853,1096,17241,Radiohead fills an interesting niche for me:  I needed relatively soft 'out there progressive' rock music that doesn't distract me from work but is stimulating enough to yoga/walk with.  I blindly bought 10 of their albums but really got into them for enjoyment after sampling this one.  I'm a dedicated Pink Floyd fan but I must admit I sometimes prefer this hypnotically spiritual spacey sound.  This album is pure mastery.,1528761600,5

Anyway I clicked on your ""music"" option. I've never had an MP3 player before. But , when I found this great album in MP3 form for $8.99 ! I thought, what have I been thinking ? So , I bought it & a whole bunch of other music here, and my new MP3 player too. I did fail to notice that like phones today require sim (?) cards in order to work, so do MP3 players require some kind of ""card"". Live & learn. I am very impressed with Amazon for even carrying ""Messianic Music"" , it's not widely listened to, and so it's not found just ""every and/or any where"". Thanks Amazon for thinking of us.

124878,10937,15014,"Im, always in search of metal with clean vocals. When I heard of Tyr, through the BNR Metal Pages, I had to check them out. For the most part, the Viking metal Ive been exposed to was a mix of clean and harsh vocals.

Right from the start, The Lay Of Thrym sounded great. The clean vocals and soaring harmonies made this mix of Viking and power metal work just right. Im pretty sure this stuff would be way too soft to ever get played on Liquid Metal but oh well, they deserve their due.

My favorites are Shadow Of The Swastika, Take Your Tyrant, Evening Star, Ellindur Bondi A Jadri, and The Lay Of Thrym. Of course, I like all the tracks, but those in particular stand out. I don't have a clue what they're singing about because I don't pay attention to the words, so the songs they sing in Farose versus English don't bother me at all.

This is good, rockin stuff and I highly recommend it.",1528848000,5

124914,18163,15724,"More than two-thirds of the reviews are not for the Intrada expanded album so you can discount those altogether.  What we have here is a remastering of the original stereo LP along with the full score (only six or seven minutes longer) in mono.  And you know what - except for obsessive, crazy must have every note of everything FANatics, the original album is perfect.  The six or seven additional minutes are not that different from the included cues, being variations on them.  And I'm sorry, I don't need to hear this in mono, ever.  As to the remastering of the LP presentation: The Varese album was HORRIBLE, so yes, this is better, but not that much better and it really should be that much better.  I shan't go into the reasons for it not being better.  Of course the score is wonderful, but the original LP presentation was perfect.",1529020800,4
124915,18417,21120,"Today it is new to many people. However, for me it is a slice of time from my history. As with all great art after one does the best that can be done with the standards, the next step is to go out to left field that threatens to lose followers and may or may not work. Just when you thought The Beatles time had come to take that step, they came out with ""The White Album"" and proved that no one knows where the classics end and experimental must begin.
I was fortunate enough to obtain one of the scarce copies in 1969. And it seemed funny to be playing ""Back In The U.S.S.R."" at West Point New York. As for the rest of the album many reviews look on this as an eclectic collection. On the surface it maybe. Then you can hear and feel the underlying pattern of the Beatles. They are just extending their range and keeping that which makes them unique.
I believe this album is addictive.
Most people look favorable on this album others look at it as a transitional time for the Beatles. Either way they realize the Beatles as any artist have down the universal fundamentals that make good music and have adapted it to a unique style.
The few detractors are usually people that do not understand what goes into music and would benefit from an appreciation class.
True some tracks probably would not be purchased as a single. It is the peril of many albums that they must carry some of the weaker contributions.
Bottom line is that this item is worth the investment.",1529020800,5

124960,18,19532,"Big Thief is a Brooklyn-based indie rock band fronted by singer/songwriter Adrienne Lenker. The band created some internet-buzz with a couple of early tracks, and that resulted in being signed to the Saddle Creek label, and the eventual release of this, their 2016 debut album.

""Masterpiece"" (12 track; 38 min.) opens with the dreamy ""Little Arrow"", a quick (2 min.) introduction to the warm vocals of Lenker. The title track (and radio single) follows, with Lenker crooning ""You saw the masterpiece, she looks a  lot like you/Wrapping her left arm around your right/Ready to walk you through the night"", just beautiful. Later on we get ""Real Love"" (radio single), where Lenker reminds us that ""Real love makes your lungs black/Real love is a heart attack"", wow. But wait, there's more! Another highlight is ""Paul"" (radio single), where Lenker brings another heartbreak story: ""Paul, I know you said you'd take me anyway I came or went/But I'll push you from my brain/See, you're a gently baby/I couldn't stay, I'd only bring you pain."" Most songs clock in around 3 min., and at 37 min., this album flies by in not time, and you will find yourself hitting the ""play"" buttom again and again. Just barely a year later after this album, Big Thief already released their second album, the equally excellent ""Capacity"", but in my book ""Masterpiece"" is the better album.

Big Thief has at time been touring as the opener for Conor Oberst, to whose Saddle Creek label the band is signed. Imagine my good fortune catching both of them last year at the beautiful Nelsonville Music Festival here in Ohio. Big Thief played an early evening set on the main stage before an appreciative crowd. If you have a chance to see Adrienne Lenker & Co. live, do not miss them! I received the ""Masterpiece"" CD as a Father's Day present from my 28 yr. old daughter who knows my musical taste quite well. Thanks Veronique! ""Masterpiece"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1529366400,4

This is the album where she really starts to experiment with the metal side of music. Don't get me wrong there is a lot of melody to the music and her voice is amazing, but this actually pretty heavy at times.

125062,16684,3394,"I did not react too good to Bob Dylan as Sinatra-like crooner, although I gave it a shot as I like to think of myself as musically open minded. I've kind of worked backwards with his most recent trilogy, starting with Triplicate, and then moving on to Fallen Angels. Finally, I recently made it to the first album in the trilogy, Shadows in the Night. What at first seemed odd, out of place and wrong, now seems so perfectly right. I just didn't like Dylan in this guise because his voice it seems was always suited to raspy, bluesy, earthy rock numbers. His unique voice is perfect for that. But not for the Great American Songbook material he's been doing recently. I thought (perhaps mistakenly) that you needed a pure, beautiful, golden, old fashioned crooner voice to do this stuff justice. You know, Sinatra, Dino, Ella, Bing, Judy, and the Divine Sarah. Dylan's voice would seem out of place here, and he does sort of miss the notes in a way that sounds like someone who can barely sing. But I kind of knew that if I gave these recordings more time and listening space, I might be able to get them. And I was right, big time.
  Dylan uses his ragged and torn voice to not just caress these tunes, but inhabit them. Get into their very fiber and core. Find out what makes them tick, and then recreate them all over. And you can have the most ripped up voice in the world and still make these songs magnificent. It takes two things: genius and care. Bob certainly has the genius, and after good, hard listening you see he really cares about this music deeply. It's not a sort of ""Oh this worked great for Rod Stewart so I'll try it too"" thing. Rod has the fantastic voice but just doesn't seem to care much in the music. Dylan knocks it out of the park. I am constantly amazed when an album by Bob that I didn't seem to get and thought was subpar or terrible, turns out to be, after time and care, really good if not really great. Chalk Shadows in the Night up on that very long list.
  You don't see musicians like this come along every day, and Dylan's like won't be seen again for maybe a hundred years or more. If ever. So this is precious stuff. Pick it up and swim in it's melancholy. It's worth it.----------PEACE",1529884800,4

When I tried to buy the soundtrack I was astonished none was available, so I settled for the suite version referenced elsewhere.  When, years later, I learned a soundtrack had been issued I was further shocked by a sales price approaching $100, well beyond my budget.  The price has been reduced to a more manageable amount, but I remain hesitant.  Why?  According to the listing the record only has about 35 minutes & omits a considerable amount of the score & there is a question as to whether its available on cd.  Thats not a whole lot longer than the suite I own.  So for now the purchase decision remains undecided.

The music is fantastic, of course and the sound is certainly decent - it could just be better with an expert restoration person at the helm.  To the person who said Bernstein was ""robbed"" of his Oscar by Tiomkin's The High and the Mighty - no, no one was robbed because The High and the Mighty is a great score, too, one of Tiomkin's best.

To the person who says it's great to have the complete soundtrack AND a Bernstein conducted suite from the film - don't know what you're smoking, pal, but there's no suite on this album.

This was a Grammy Award-winning album (it won over The Beatles, for heaven's sake), so I wish Sony/BMG treated it with a bit more respect.  Since Marty Paich did other RCA albums for Kerr, perhaps he did the charts - that info is nowhere online.

I'm 67 now and I love it. Music like this is timeless for those that love music.

In fact, amazingly not even the slightest tick, pop, or crackle. Absolutely dead quiet on the lead ins and just a super high quality pressing. The book with the song by song descriptions by Tom Petty himself is just icing on the cake. Stellar release! One note, there apparently was an error using the original hype stickers listing 180g vinyl. These in fact weigh in (by other reports I've read) in the 150-160g range and are not 180g vinyl.

125211,15913,19206,"I first heard this album on the Amazon Prime streaming service, but wanted to buy a copy for when I'm out away from the network. Anyone who likes to sit somewhere away from the world with their digital device would benefit from doing the same. Also this format lends itself much better than streaming to the endless playbacks and slowdowns which come with self learning a song.

This compilation includes ragtimes, jigs, ballads, quicksteps, schottisches (which, b.t.w. originated in Bohemia rather than Scotland), minstrel songs, Tin Pan Alley favorites,  polkas, hymns, reels, hornpipes, waltzes, blues, more and more and more! There are a couple of odd style numbers (such as Wild River Rag by The Wild Mountain Fiddlers) I'd defy anyone to say that they can't learn a lick or two from almost every track.

I'll agree with Beelzebubba about this being a library of fiddle tunes however they are not only for beginners. (And I choke on my iced tea every time I read the word ""bluegrass"" applied to anything except for original Monroe music done in original style.) Classic American fiddle tunes are played here with the right rhythms and embellishments for their various styles and American fiddling is very broad in stylistic variation. Said ""right"" playing (not too fast, not too slow, not to simple, not too many flutters and wows) is something which comes with years of practice; the beginner will gain from listening but so will the thirty year veteran.

Many of the songs are old barn dance and fiddler's contest favorites. I'd say at least half would be acceptable at any old time fiddler's contest. The other half generally stand on their own merit and would be great for other venues.

These sound mostly like modern studio recordings, clear and well recorded. While some of the songs date from before the cylinder phonograph era they lack the idiosyncratic sounds of the old equipment. It does sound that this crop of post WWii musicians is a good as the ones of the past. Some of the fiddlers sound like they are classically trained but are deliberately holding down the classic excesses. It sounds like their instruments are for the most part very good; there are a couple of tracks where I think the fiddler is playing with a mute to get that thinner old radio sound without the static.

Some of the songs feature mandolin, guitar, banjo, hammered dulcimer, piano, organ. This doesn't make them any less impressive than played on a fiddle or less playable on one.",1531872000,5

125215,1805,14026,"Im going to start off by saying that I was underwhelmed by Part I.  It lacked a visceral quality; it was very symphonic but it lacked punch and exciting flourish.  Part II is more of the same, but it is better (I think).  While still very symphonic it also puts more emphasis into its punch, its bite.  The guitar work is more present (or at least more obvious to my ears) and a lot more driving than in Part I.  But I discovered a curious thing while listening through the album several times.  When I listened to the album as a whole I thought it was okay to good but still not really great.  Maybe there still wasn't enough distinctiveness between the songs for me to hang my standout moments or tracks on, or maybe the songs blurred together too much.  Whatever it was I still came away from the experiences not feeling fulfilled or whatever I was looking to feel by this release.  But when I listened to the release song by song, focusing on each song individually instead of part of the whole, I was surprised to find that I enjoyed this album a whole lot more.  Godmakers Temptation is a classic VP sound, an engaging track, and part of the first half of this release.  The following song Stone Roses Edge breaks into a gallop early on with some delicious guitars and nice keys surrounding them and filling them out, a heavy beat upping the intensity.  The first half of this release is pretty solid in fact.  Where I found myself losing interest or felt that the songs lost either energy or had an unfortunate blending was toward the end of the release.  And I think thats why this was so hard for me to really get into, because the first track (vision eleven as part of the Chronicles story) didn't immediately grab but the following three or four tacks did and then there were about three where the car slowed down before ending pretty well.  Symphonic metal fans, metal fans who like large religiously-tinged fantasy stories, and I suppose VD fans all will be satiated by Netherworld Part II.  For me, I will hope that they strip their sound down at points, and separate their flourishes on their next outing.  3.75 stars.",1531958400,4

That being said, after first listen I was disheartened.  However, after repeated listens, it's quickly grown on me!.

There are many great songs on 48:13: Eez-Eh, Stevie, Bumblebee, Treat, Bow.  I do feel these would have been great-ER had Serge, the creative mastermind behind Kasabian, who also took on the role of Producer for 48:13, done less production work with dubbing, overdubbing & electronics. Both Tom's (lead singer) & Serge's (backing & some lead) vocals are in fine form.  The lyrics are a bit repetitive.  Serge is definitely flexing his creative ""muscles"" on 48:13 & I have to believe that's a good thing which will continue to carry Kasabian forward rather than repeating themselves.  It is definitely more electronic than earlier releases, but it does work after all!  Just don't be anticipating another West Ryder Pauper Lunatic Asylum or Velociraptor and if you don't discount it after the first full listen, you'll probably grow to appreciate it very quickly.  Kasabian don't usually release the same sounds twice; 48:13 just goes a little further ""left of the dial""!!  I'd strongly recommend going for the 48:13 Deluxe version which comes with a bonus live DVD because Kasabian live are always a ""Treat""!!!

Now I have a rather large collection of soundtrack & movie score albums. Personally I think this is a great album, but that might be the nostalgia talking. As a teenager who loved reading science fiction I thought this movie was great and had to buy the soundtrack. The weird electronic music was like nothing I had heard before. Even today I still get that same feeling listening to the album after all those years. I'm very happy with my purchase.",1532563200,5

It seems just like yesterday that Radiohead released its latest (9th overall) album, but in fact it's been already over two years ago since the band unleashed ""A Moon Shaped Pool""onto the world. I have to admit, at first I wasn't really ""getting it"", but over time, this album has in turn released its inner beauty and I have been playing this album a LOT in the last couple of months, ahead of the band's return to Cincinnati (more on that later).

""A Moon Shaped Pool"" (11 tracks; 53 min.) opens with the urgent ""Burn The Witch"", which reminds me of the ""Hail to the Thief"" songs. It is followed by ""Daydreaming"", an introspective tune (and traditional concert opener on the current tour). We then get to ""Decks Dark"", which is my favorite track: I love the gradual build-up, and then the extra kick in the last 90 sec., just perfect, The album is now revved up and in full gear. Not that it means the songs are all loud or hard, far from it, but there is a cohesion to the soundscape as we go from track to track that just feels right. Among other highlights: ""Ful stop"" is mesmerizing, and ""The Numbers"" feels wistful. The album's closer is ""True Love Waits"", the song that has been around for 2 decades in one form or another. The live acoustic guitar version on 2001's ""I Might Be Wrong: Live Recordings"" is a thing of beauty, but now comes this definitive version, featuring piano and keyboards, rather than acoustic guitar. What a great song.

I've seen Radiohead live a number of times over the years, and had the good fortune of seeing them in concert again this week here in Cincinnati. They played a 2 hr. 20 min. show that can only be described as magical. Playing from pretty much their entire catalog, the sold-out crowd ate it up from start to finish. The 4 songs from ""A Moon Shaped Pool"" blended in nicely. Check this out: Set List Cincinnati 7/25/18: 1. Daydreaming 2. Desert Island Disk 3. Ful Stop 4.2 + 2 = 5 5. Myxomatosis 6. Kid A 7. All I Need 8. Videotape 9. Lucky 10. Bloom 11. Everything in Its Right Place 12. Lotus Flower 13. Reckoner 14. The National Anthem 15. Idioteque 16.

125269,898,21145,"I admit that I keep an open mind to listening to multiple online, offline and local radio sources for accessing my past, current, and future music interests. Recently, I encountered a situation through my iheartradio app where 2 of the local radio rock stations I enjoy listening to have yet to play and work even though I recently and easily got an outside the metropolitan Washington D.C. area radio station to work. It is a good thing that I at least still have a radio inside my apartment yet I still wanted to way to listen to some classic rock music when outside of my apartment despite the situation. Fortunately, I came across this Amazon music playlist that is Top Prime Songs: Classic Rock that contains a range of classic rock tunes such as; Hotel California by the Eagles, Here Comes the Sun by the Beatles, Dont Fear the Reaper by Blue Oyster Cult, Listen To the Music by the Doobie Brothers,Beast of Burden by the Rollingstones, Lifes Been Good by Joe Walsh, music by Peter Gabriel, Aerosmith, Foghat, Kansas, Heart, ZZTop, and more. The only caveat is that this Top Prime Songs Classic Rock playlist is currently at the time of this writing just a sampler of 25 songs and leaves out a number of other artists groups such as; Bon Jovi, Journey, Billy Idol, Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, Clash, The Cure, the Styx, The Cars, David Bowie, Tom Petty, Survivor,Van Halen etc. (you get the picture).",1532822400,5

It will make a lot more sense and probably offend less people with the actual condition. My only gripe is that the song feels extremely short.

There are 3 things that I have bought that greatly improved the sound quality of my stereo. !. I bought an Oppodigital disc player, one of the older ones , much better than the CD Deck I was using at the time. 2. I replaced the power cord to the Oppodigital with a thicker better quality cord 3 I used the glide tracks on the Cardus Audio CD on my system , I had owned my stereo the way it was for about 5 years before I bought the cardas CD. The reviewer in the hifi magazine suggested I play a song that I was previously very familiar with before I use the glide track on the Cardas CD. I played a song that I liked a lot and was normal song length. Then I played track 1 ,the short glide track on my stereo. I played the same song again, Honestly, I could hear a very significant improvement to my sound system. I went ahead and used track 7,the long glide track on my system. The disk improved my car stereo also. I bet this guy makes a good disc player.",1532995200,5

125281,19489,16876,"Streamed the Album first. Don't like it at all but loved his other work 5 stars+. That said, it's an example of a wider musical range than you'd expect based on his earlier albums. Off in left field of is a better description.  Maybe he's tired of the comparisons to Waylon Jennings? Like Dwight Yoakum he has the ability to cover a wide range of genre's. Gave it a 3 because it's not bad; its just not something I would purchase.  I have 2 musical likes: Mountain style picking AKA Stanley brothers not to be confused with Bill Monroe who I can take or leave & Bakersfield/red dirt, rock-a-billy style like Haggard, Buck Owens, de-railers & some Waylon Jennings & Gorge Jones. I still like Dwight when he does traditional Bakersfield. Last time I saw him live he did several haggard tunes, very well. Many other like Kenny Rodgers & Conway Twitty were rock singers before they hit main stream country. Different is ok but when you can't stick to a format your part of the problem. Similar to Jamey Johnson: his album ""in color"" was awesome. Every thing since is ok with a few really good tracks here & there like his cover of ""four walls of Rayford"". Still like him too. Sturgill, please make more of what you did on the first 2 albums.",1533081600,3

Before the days of formulaic top 40 crap, Sir Paul was off in Africa, trying to write and record a masterpiece. The story of this album is amazing, sad, and funny. Surprised, in a way, that it got made at all.

Well worth the effort, as long as you're not expecting songs to follow the same old model we're all used to nowadays. Paul throws in time changes left and right, one second the intro's doing one thing, the next, the song takes off in a completely different direction - and that's perfectly all right.",1533254400,5

125346,10506,21150,"1964 was the banner year for Supremes albums IMO. The WHERE DID OUR LOVE GO album featured their first two No. 1 hits as well as a couple of failed earlier singles and some choice album cuts. Also released in 64, A BIT OF LIVERPOOL was recorded to cash in on the British Invasion craze and the girls do a terrific job interpreting this material. The harmonies on this album are glorious and Florence fans will love this as she can be heard loud and clear on most tracks. There are many highlights to be found here:

A HARD DAYS NIGHT has appeared on the 1974 triple LP ANTHOLOGY set and Ive always loved their performance of this song. Flo just wails in the background and they mimic the Yowwww before the instrumental break perfectly. They really should have mixed the handclaps farther up though to give it more of that trademark Supremes sound. Florences impeccable diction really makes BITS AND PIECES especially memorable. HOUSE OF THE RISING SUN could have been a laughable mess but amazingly, its one of my favorite songs on here. The organ is used sparingly in favor of an extra-twangy guitar. On HOW DO YOU DO IT, youd be hard-pressed to tell it was even The Supremes singing it, the vocal is so unusual.

I think this album is more satisfying than hearing them perform other Motown hits by the Four Tops or Vandellas or doing their supper-club act. Highly recommended and one of their most enjoyable albums. BTW I scored a copy of the Japanese CD release for a good price by doing an Internet search.",1533945600,5

His work is subtle, always feels right, the musicians are tops - all that and the great Hubert Laws.  What could go wrong?  Not a damn thing.  If you don't have this you need to.

Perhaps a philosophical musing on the working man, so caught up in the daily grind and responsibilities, that he is either afraid of or just putting off his artistic, passionate endeavors until later?

This is an album to play when you are in a contemplative mood (or mode!) -- or perhaps I should say it will take you there!  While it is not ""rock 'n roll' it is still very contemporary and moves you in both heart and soul -- and maybe even in body.  I downloaded it as the CD version was unattainable.

Skrillex is a master DJ and composer of dance songs. The beat here is fantastic, and the lyrics have a theme. They are thought out. This is a good song.",1534550400,4

125391,16218,19195,"When I first got this I was a little dismayed at how short the songs were, being used to the DBT's rangy, drawn-out style. However, after a time I started to appreciate the precise nature of these songs. There's no filler, no self-indulgence. It's just get to the point, make it, and get out of there. Musically and lyrically. Having a pretty intimate acquaintance with pretty much all of DBT's work, I would say this one is definitely different from most of their output, but it's still a crackerjack album. Put it on when you have a few friends around, crack some beers and a bottle of something and you can't go wrong. I would say, though, that it needs to be played on a proper stereo to get the full appreciation for these songs. I have a lot of music in digital only format but I am real glad I got this on CD. It really kicks butt on my aging but still decent Yamaha/Rotel/Boston Acoustic set-up.  I only wish that some of the tunes were a bit longer... especially the rockers and if that's contradictory well that's OK. The band themselves have always been a little contradictory. As to the messaging on the album, which judging by the reviews turns a lot of people off, I have no problem with it whatsoever. If you want a rock album that's all about getting drunk and getting laid, buy something by AC/DC or Motley Crue. This is rock with brains and it works just fine. I like the cover too... this form of political protest if you want to call it that, has never been so necessary or relevant as it is now. BTW, if you like this, check out Lee Bains III and the Glory Fires. Also from Alabama and also progressive. And they rock out too!",1534636800,4

125394,898,16922,This song Close by Nick Jonas feat. Tove Lo is a compelling love dance/hip-hop that appears to be about how the dynamics of two people who want to get close. The well timed duo music collaboration between Nick Jonas and Tove Lo creates a lively and bold love song.,1534636800,5
125395,10941,13034,"I've had METRIC'S PAGANS IN VEGAS since its' release, so this review comes after some time.  I suppose I held off writing a review because I vacillate on how I feel.  I still don't feel it's in the same league as ""Synthetica"" (reviewed separately) & ""Fantasies"", which you know you love on first listen!  Other reviewers have noted PAGANS is more eletro/synth. than others, so perhaps that has something to do with it.  When I do go electronic, I still enjoy hearing guitar(s) too, especially a strong bass line and strong drums.

PAGAN'S opening track, ""Lie, Lie, Lie"" is a terrific one! which would be quite at home on either of the aforementioned METRIC CD/LP's.  Track #3 ""The Shade"" has that ethereal, haunting beauty and is quite good, as well as Track #7 ""Too Bad, So Sad"" which almost reaches a ""Youth Without Youth"" tone, while Track #5 ""Cascades"", another favorite, veers into an almost Depeche Mode/New Order sound.  Track #4 ""Celebrate"" isn't as likable, for me, having an EDM (electronic dance music) quality.  While I enjoy some EDM, I just feel METRIC defies genres, mixing & blending expertly to form their unique sound.

I agree that PAGANS IN VEGAS is definitely more of an electronic release.  Aside from some odd zappy eletro-synth. sounds on some tracks,  PAGANS IN VEGAS, while different from earlier releases, is a strong grower!!!  P.S. Upon some research, I've learned METRIC'S newest release is scheduled for late September!!!  Upon hearing first single ""Dark Saturday"" (fantastic!), if that's representative of the whole I'll be captivated with what may possibly be METRIC'S Finest!!  In the meantime, there's plenty of dazzling METRIC music to keep listeners ears happy!!",1534636800,4

How this was cut from the Bond film utterly baffles me, but doesn't surprise me. It has so much more complexity and intensity than the one that was eventually chosen. It also doesn't feel like Radiohead changing themselves to fit a soundtrack style. It's pure Radiohead, and it's pure genius.",1535241600,5

Hello, from the other side, I must have called a thousand times

(Courtesy of Amazon Prime)
Five POWERFUL Stars. From the multi-award winning album 25, this is a marvelous, deliberately-building performance by multi-Grammy award winning singer, songwriter Adele performing Hello backed only by a piano and strings: no other instruments needed. Its about a distant love, an old love affair that still haunts her, and a need for closure. She takes the lyric for a memorable, emotional, thrill ride. The song won Song of the Year, Best Pop Solo Performance and Record of the Year. My Highest Recommendation. Five SOARING Stars. (XL Recordings/Columbia. 1-MP3 track. Time-4:55.)",1535241600,5

For instance, ""Land of Confusion"" out and out rawks and ""Voices"" is a great one also! There's more, but I've just spent 7 hours behind a radio station's console, am having the world's biggest brain fart and am too lazy to look up a discography. Let's put it this way; if you really like Disturbed, you'll like this S&G cover!",1535241600,3
