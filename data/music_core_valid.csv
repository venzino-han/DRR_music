75306,1332,17405,"Not a massive fan of Shadows in the night, & this next part of Dylans Sinatra odyssey hasn't really made me a convert.
Admittedly I do like On a little street & an enjoyable up tempo jazz version of That old black magic, but a lot of the album (to me) sounds a bit samey.  Perhaps if Dylan had gotten someone to produce the album there may have been a bit more spark to it.
I know Dylan is famed for releasing music constantly goes against the grain of what critics & fans expect, but for such a prominent songwriter its just a little frustrating that weve got another covers record.
So not a bad album, but if weren't the biggest fan of Shadow.., then Fallen Angles problem isn't going to float your boat to much.",1463875200,3

75308,3130,3575,"The classics are the best cuts on this live album but it's worth it for the version of ""Awaken"" along with an extended version of ""America"", two cuts that didn't make in onto ""Yessongs"".  That's thirty minutes right there.  The singing and playing on Awaken in particular are impeccable - really mind-blowing; my only complaint being that Steve Howe's incredible guitar work occasionally gets buried in the mix.  Overall, the recording quality is excellent.  Jon Anderson never sounded better, live or in the studio.  I was going with four stars at first because I thought some of the newer material was a little weak, but decided I'd feel bad if someone missed out on the jewels on this album as a result.",1463875200,5
75309,5338,16076,Best album of 2016!,1463875200,5
75310,12301,17405,"With none of the arrangements on Fallen Angels being true to the originals, it would be easy to say that this was just Bob Dylan being Bob Dylan, and putting his personal mark on these songs ... though almost to the point where they are unrecognizable.  I have to wonder whats going on with this his second album of covers, and I have my thoughts, having seen and heard this concept done time and time again by other aging artists.

There are some muted jazz arrangements here that should stand with more strength and life, yet Dylan, a huge jazz fan, has chosen to nearly hide what he appreciates most.  That Old Black Magic has been turned into a rockabilly shuffle, It Had To Be You barely holds together, as he seems to be nearly reading these songs rather than singing them.  In all honesty, this album sounds like another dreamy look back at his own youth [in much the same manner as Sinatra did] trying to figure out where he fits in during this, the first half of the 21st century, or if it even matters that he does.

Call this gathering of songs whimsical if you will, but please, do not call them great or inspirational, as they come off rather lightweight, shadows of shadows, delivered by a man who may or may not be in the moment as these tracks were recorded.  In a strange way though, the songs all do hang together, but mostly in a manner where Dylan is trying to prove that these vintage ballads are still valid, and thus, if they are, then so is Dylan.

Of course there are those who are gonna tell you that its all brilliant, but its not, and its a real shame that for all his greatness, Bob Dylan cant take his time and present his vision of his later life, or the worlds hes lived through, rather than stepping back into some long lost comfort zone where he no longer needs to gaze out of his window.

But ... you may find it all touching and romantic, so by all means celebrate with Mr. Dylan, for his times, they certainly have changed.

75330,313,17437,"On his previous release&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mplsound/dp/B0030W1LBC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mplsound</a>&nbsp;Prince was making it abundantly clear that he was reaching towards his classic one-man-band Minneapolis sound as a means of progressing into the future. This is actually a move he made on a number of occasions when his music and career seemed in question. Well right now his career isn't in that state at all. He's musically revered by many in this generation and was recently given a tribute on the BET Music Awards this past year. Prince himself also seems to obsessed with some strange form of eternal youth in which his music doesn't age but his lyrical themes mature.

You will not find any explicit lyrics on this album for sure,same as you won't find them on any of his albums since 2001. That doesn't mean that effects the music at all because these are the most energized,lively,funky and musically sophisticated songs Prince has done in the new millennium. The album opens and ends on the same basic musical note with ""Compassion"" and ""Everybody Loves Me"" embracing the shuffling LINN drum led rockabilly styled funk with lyrics that alternately speak of both selflessness and selfishness. ""Beginning Endlessly"",the amazing ""Sticky Like Glue"" and ""Lavaux"" all embrace the classic Prince all encompassing funk groove with some delicious synthesizer squiggles and layored drum and percussion tracks.

He hasn't lost his touch as a multi instrumentalist in the least bit and actually has expanded on it to include light rhythmic nods to both hip-hop/R&B and contemporary 80's dance revival (itself based on his own original music) without shamelessly surrendering to either style and still being himself. Songs like ""Future Love Song"",""Walk In The Sand"" and ""Sea Of Everything"" also embrace Prince's touch with the slow jam to it's absolute best effect. Typical of Prince he makes you flip through 75 separate 2-4 second empty tracks before we get to cut 77,which is the title song offered as a very hidden bonus selection. This is very much a TAFKAP era sounding funk/rap styled number but still his one-man-band style is very much in attendence. After all these years Prince obviously has no intent on being a fossil. He wants to keep being himself and now that he's in his 50's he also refuses to musically look down on those younger than them and also embraces many of their ideas into his own.",1463875200,5
75331,1463,17438,"If anyone comes close to expressing the ineffable splendor of nature through music, it is Jill Haley. Her National Park Soundscapes album illuminates both the grandeur and subtlety of these natural wonders. Each piece is beautifully written in tribute to a particular park and enhanced by the musical chemistry between Jill and her talented accompanists, making for a most enchanting listening experience.

Jill Haley is best known for her exquisite artistry on English horn and oboe and has been a guest artist on a great number of albums recorded by GRAMMY winning producer and Windham Hill Records founder Will Ackerman at his iconic Imaginary Road Studios in Vermont. However, as I discovered in writing about some of Jills own music, she is quite an accomplished pianist as well.

The album includes 4 tracks from her previous National Park albums, as well as 8 new songs inspired by other Parks such as Acadia, Badlands, Cuyahoga Valley, Everglades, Grand Canyon, Shenandoah, Valley Forge, and Yosemite. The recording is, to some degree, a family affair with Jill being joined by her husband David Cullen (guitar and bass), Dana Cullen (horn), Graham Cullen (cello), and Tony Deangelis (percussion and snare drum). All are excellent musicians in their own right and each brings their particular gift to this project.

I must also point out the gorgeous packaging of the CD, which includes a 15-page full color booklet with a photo of each National Park that is portrayed in the music. For me, it added to the experience to look at the photos while listening and get more of a visual sense of the landscape. This kind of packaging has been a trademark of Jills National Park Series albums. It also makes the CD a wonderful gift for nature lovers everywhere.

One of the things Im most impressed by in Jills playing is her melodic sensibility. Every note is perfectly placed and just right for the context it is in. But beyond the structure of her music, is the emotional expressiveness Jill evokes from her instruments. These qualities are beautifully utilized in painting musical portraits of each of these diverse natural landscapes.

75368,56,17445,"It has been a very hard for Celine Dion, with the devastating death of her soulmate and manager, Rene Angeil. But it is a will she has to try and find so near to her soul for herself and her kids at heart. His death from cancer really took a toll on her soul, and it had showed why her work from the past few albums, like Loved Me Back To Life, were not even strong as she had from the past works. But now, she is trying to find her own will in her voice and sincerely at heart as well, especially carrying on without her soulmate at heart, but keeping him near in the somber spirit and envisioned mind. Her first single since Rene's death, The Show Must Go On, is a deep and somber cover of Queen's final hit with the great Freddie Mercury actually is a deep song that really sticks with her. This cover had been performed by so many artists before Celine, like Elton John in the 90's, as remembering Freddie whom died of AIDS in 1991 nicely. Celine takes her own spin, and honestly makes this a better song for her in a long time that works, carrying on Rene's spirit at soul. Artists like Rihanna and Beyonce' Knowles have not taken notice with why they have made such poor choices in song, where Celine has made some really strong ones. But now for Celine, she should try and channeling her spirit in song, for Rene is the spirit she seeks in song with each and every note she now sings, and hopefully will keep listening and leading to life. This is a good download for any die hard Celine Dion fan.

There aren't really any hooks/choruses in any of the songs, and I think that's another thing that's throwing a lot of people off (myself included).

On a more positive side, I would rather listen to Views than If You're Reading This. I hated everything about that album except maybe 1 song.

75413,2149,17405,"Absolutely love this new Dylan album. Loved his last ""standards"" album Shadows in the Night too but this is arguably an even better song selection and he performs these classics with real feeling and obvious passion for the material. I really lament the so called fans who expect rerun after rerun of Highway 61 Revisited or Blonde on Blonde; the same people who go to his concerts expecting to see a 25 year old Dylan singing songs from over 40 years ago just like he sang them 40 years ago and then moan that ""he's not like he used to be"".

75424,4745,16276,"Mixed emotions on this one.  Some of the best performances were also in the ""Big Violin Box"". e.g., the Suk recordings of the Mozart Concertos ##2 & 3. the Oistrakh recording of the Dvorak and the Elman recordings of the Lalo Symphonie espagnole (4 movement version).  That also has some of the Szigeti/Arrau Beethoven Sonatas (##6, 7 & 8) and excellent recordings of the Franck Sonata and Beethoven's ""Kreutzer"" by Oistrakh, as well as a number of encores performed by Oistrakh and by Elman.  This does have a very fine recording of the Glazunov Concerto with Oistrakh , a good (if old-fashioned) Elman recording of a Bach Concerto and very fine (and comparatively modern) recordings of the Bruch Concerto #1 and his Scottish Fantasy.  On the other hand...

The Joseph Silverstein recordings of the Beethoven, Brahms, Mendelssohn, Tchaikovsky and Mozart #5 are, to put it mildly, disappointing.  There's just nothing very distinctive here.  There is no ""personality and he often seems rather tentative.  The Tchaikovsky is played with the cuts restored but some of these are rather repetitive passages sound even more forced and repetitive than normal here.  The orchestral contributions (Utah Symphony under various un-named conductors, except for the Mozart, which has the Rochester Philharmonic) add little.  The sound (probably from the 1980s) has less presence than many RCA recordings from the 1950s.  If you don't have the Big Violin Box and/or have an interest in the Glazunov and Bruch, it's worth it but otherwise, consider carefully.  If these would be your only recordings of the Beethoven, Brahms, Mendelssohn and Tchaikovsky, you're cheating yourself.",1463961600,4

75459,3003,17307,"British soul singer Corinne Bailey Rae didn't always have dreams of doing rhythm and blues. Her first foray into music was being the lead singer of an all-female alt-rock band named Helen - a band modeled after the American female rockers L7. Although largely ignored by labels in their hometown, they were offered a recording contract with American hard rock/heavy metal label Roadrunner Records in the late 90's. Before they could sign the contract, the bass player of the group became pregnant, which caused the group to disband. Figuring out what to do next, she decided to ditch rock music for soul music and made guest appearances on albums by other London acts. One of those collaborations led her to a recording contract with EMI Records UK, which resulted in her 2006 self titled debut. The album delivered hit singles such as ""Like A Star"" as well as ""Put Your Records On"", which brought her fame in England as well as the United States. In the middle of recording her next album, she got the news that her husband Jason Rae had died of a drug overdose. The incident would later cause her to delay and shift the direction of the album, which became her 2010 sophomore set ""The Sea"". 2012 saw Corinne record the ballad ""Chains"" for the Quentin Tarantino executive produced RZA film ""The Man With The Iron Fists"". Also in that same year, she experienced yet another setback - this time, due to issues surrounding her record label. Due to corporate restructuring, Corinne was moved from EMI to its sister label Virgin Records. She was delayed even further due to Virgin getting a new CEO in the form of former A&M and Geffen executive Ron Fair.

She set about recording a new album, only this time, her longtime producers suggested that she record in Los Angeles. Initially hesitant of the move, she ended up recording with the likes of Valerie Simpson, Esperanza Spalding, Marcus Miller, ""Black Messiah""'s session musicians Isaiah Starkey and James Gadson and lastly, KING members Amber and Paris Strother. Those collaborations would end up on Corinne's first album in six years ""The Heart Speaks In Whispers"".  On her new album, she takes on an sound that's very reminiscent of the R&B music scene of the mid to late 80's. She opens the album with the optimistic ""The Skies Will Break"" and decides to give a lover a second chance on the acoustic ballad ""Hey, I Won't Break Your Heart"". She reflects on a romance's perfect timing on ""I've Been To The Moon"" and brings a club sound to the romantic atmosphere on ""Tell Me"". She  uses nature as a romantic setting on the first single ""Green Aphrodisiac"" and gets sensual on ""Horse Print Dress"". On the ballad  ""Do You Think Of Me"", she laments over having to be in a long distance relationship. She hopes for a long lasting love on ""Taken By Dreams"", while closing the album with ""Night"". ""The Heart Speaks In Whispers"" is another great recording from Corinne Bailey Rae. Despite the numerous setbacks she's faced over the years, it hasn't put a damper on her music - or her career. Although it's been a minute that she's released an album, she shows that she hasn't lost a step.",1463961600,5

75482,5777,6655,"""It's Alright Ma, I'm Only Bleeding"" isn't my all time favorite Dylan song but it is my favorite lyrics ever written by Dylan. I know that may sound a little strange to say. But as a music lover who always is on the look out for songs with thought provoking and poignant lyrics I have never known a song by anyone whose lyrics capture my attention and inspire me as this song does. This is definitely Dylan at his absolute best in creativity. I mean take away the music and Bob's voice and what you have left is a poem that reads like some kind of Pulitzer Prize winning work of art. There are some songs I can never grow tired of listening to and ""It's Alright Ma"" is one of those. This is classic Dylan From his early years and one song from that period any Dylan fan would want to put onto their MP3 device.

(10/13/2016 An added note to my review: I just heard that Bob Dylan won the 2016 Nobel Prize for Literature for his lyrics and how they changed American music. That probably rates better then if he had won the Pulitzer! Congrats Bob!)",1463961600,5

75493,13898,8519,"""I Cry"" is a song by American hip hop artist Flo Rida. The track was first released on September 18, 2012 as the fourth single from his fourth studio album, Wild Ones.[1] The song is based on Bingo Players' ""Cry (Just a Little)"" which samples ""Piano in the Dark"" by Brenda Russell. ""I Cry"" was produced by the French production duo soFLY & Nius and the Futuristics, and it was written by Flo Rida, The Futuristics, Scott Cutler, Jeffrey Hull, Brenda Russell, and soFLY & Nius.
""I Cry"" received mixed reviews from music critics, who criticized its lyrical content and production, and stated that it would have been better with a collaboration with Sia Furler, who previously collaborated with Flo Rida on the song, ""Wild Ones"". However, some critics were positive towards its catchiness and club-nature. The song received commercial success upon its release, peaking inside the top ten in many countries including Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland, United Kingdom and United States. A music video was released for the single on YouTube. This song is the second track on Now 45.",1463961600,5

For the Goo Goo Dolls the 11th release from Warner Bros. Records use 3 studio drummers in replacement of their ex-drummer who left in 2013 manage. Still holding true to their sound though with a mellower sound. Its easy listening well worth getting. Something I thought of especially when I saw the album name for the new Goos record. These close ironic similarities are neat to know and by to great albums I happen to like very much. They are Goo Goo Dolls Boxes and R.E.M. Up. These 2 albums are the 11th studio albums both released on Warner Bros. Records (both bands were on Warner Bros. Records for the most part of their career). Both albums are without their drummers and used studio drummers with both albums going a more mellow pop rock approach, and lastly the names of the albums are so close to each other. R.E.M. refers to boxes with arrows pointing up (boxes label this side up) (though R.E.M. refer to mood as being up or down...still total boxes references) and Goo Goo Dolls Boxes the song refers to mood & memories and on the Goo Goo Dolls cd had 2 arrows pointing up like how R.E.M. does on Up referring to this side up...anyways thought I share...neat stuff.. both worth owning..Enjoy!",1463961600,5

75510,4277,11277,"I'll try to keep this fairly short by starting with I'm a longtime fan of the Chemical Bros. and love albums like ""Exit Planet Dust"" Bros Gonna Work It Out Mixtape"", ""Dig YOur Own HOle"", and ""Surrender"" (an under-appreciated classic I think), and that singles collection double-disc was fantastic. There have been a few albums in recent years here and there that haven't really grabbed me the way those albums that I just listed did but those albums always had their redeeming songs. Anyways what I'm saying is this is the first Chemical Brothers album I've heard in many years since Surrender that really just blew me away. It truly is innovative and is programmed, written, and executed brilliantly here. Born In Echoes never loses their trademark sound but still stays true to trying new areas and the Beck collab is just mindblowing. Really there isn't anything bad I can say about this album. If you liked the albums I listed in this review and like the Bros. then this is highly recommended. Anyone who likes electronic music should give it a shot at least once I think.",1463961600,5

75522,12301,17462,"These epic compilations, and usually for a good cause, have always managed to stumble me, often leaving me to feel that by reviewing something of this nature, that I would be less than noble by leaving people to feel that the endeavor is hardly musically worthwhile.

Certainly the Grateful Dead in all of its incarnations has left us with a staggering catalog of music, and like all artists, often times hearing another musicians take on a song might spark a light, bring back some long forgotten memories, and perhaps bring some fresh vibes to the table.  Though having said all of this, there seems to be but a few artists on the outing who actually fit the nature and theme of The Grateful Dead ... in that theyve nothing in common with the late 60s and early 70s mind-bending psychedelic alternative country weirdness that spawned a movement that lives on to this very day.  Most of these artists, try as they might, merely see these songs as bits of broken mirrors that they can neither piece together, or fully understand the nature of what these songs reflect.

Major exceptions of course are Touch Of Grey by War On Drugs, Box Of Rain by Kurt Vile, Goin Down The Road Feeling Bad by Lucinda Williams.  These artists, along with the other twelve tracks that Ive kept, have managed to not only make the songs their own, but have managed to find the heart and soul of the numbers they cover.  Most of the other artists, while presenting a good rendition, just don't own what they're doing.  Most of these songs will not give you respect for The Dead, they only showcase the artist whos presenting, leaving me to feel that many of the songs by the nature of their presentation ended up not being even faithful variations of Grateful Dead music.  All and all, there is not a cohesive flow, no contextual point of reference, no emersion that guides you down the rabbit hole and out the other side a changed person.

Granted, it was recorded in 1986.  The technology was available to record vocals correctly.  It sounds like they held a microphone up and hoped for the best.

The reason I gave it two starts vice one is that the song choice was pretty good and the band sounded ok considering.  Again - horrible vocal recordings.  Save your money.",1464048000,2

75588,56,17468,"The past few years have been extremely difficult for Celine Dion. Professionally she had put her show in Las Vegas on hold for a little while so she could redeem herself. But personally, she was deeply strugling in her life, with the deaths of two of her men in her life, both of her family members, her brother and her soulmate and husband Rene Angeil died tragically from cancer. It really took a toll on her. But also her music had not been doing as well to the success of sales that she had in the 90's and the 2000's with her personal status. But now with a lot of loss, Celien has to come back from the verge of massive destruction. Her comeback single, a take on Queen's The Show Must Go On, their final song with the great Freddie Mercury actually works for her well, and places the power ballad in her voice and heart in hand nicely with not a lot of strains overall. There have been so many artists whom had covered the song and paid respects to Freddie nicely with that song before Celine, like Elton John whom remembered Freddie shortly after her lost his life to AIDS in 1991, and it worked brilliantly. But for Celine, the song takes on a deep soul from her, and doesn't show to be overbearing from where she loses herself in soul and song. This works very well from Celine and compliments a lot of cover songs she had done before like Cyndi Lauper's I Drove All Night or Herat's Alone from Taking Chances in 2007. If you are a massive fan of Celine Dion, than I suggest you download this song.

75635,4505,17472,"I'm not familiar with this band at all. I gave it a shot because my Amazon music app recommended it. I enjoyed it, at least these 5 tracks that where part of the 'Retrospective' package. I wouldn't call this a groundbreaking band that's going to change music forever or anything like that. But they are pretty good. The lead singer has a great voice. The band is good.

I liked 4 out of 5 of these songs. So 4 stars seemed like a pretty straightforward rating.

 Something To Believe In - First off, this is not a remake of the Poison song. It's got a great beat strong vocals. I really like the sound. The lyrics are very good, with a message about hope and the future.

 Danny, Dakota & The Wishing Well - It's a ballad story song about 2 people who were in love when they were young, drifted apart, had messed up separate lives, and wished they were back together. I really enjoyed this song. The lyrics, the story, the vocals, and the music. This is good stuff.

 Paralysed - They do an electronic sound thing here that I'm not sold on. It's downright annoying for the first few seconds, but it settles down a bit. The vocals are tuned in a weird way. I like the lyrics. And I like that they are making the sound weird to match the lyrics. But this is not pleasurable to my ears in any way. I like what they are going for, I just don't think they quite pulled it off. This is the only track of the 5 I didn't like.

 Harbour Lights - This track has beautiful lyrics. It's all about seeing someone you love as being a foundation of your life, not as someone used along the way. And its got the message that we should focus on people who add to our lives, not on people we can use to get ahead. I love that message. The vocals are well done. The music is more subtle than on other tracks to let the poetry of the song come through. This was easily my favorite track of the 5.

 Message In The Sand -  Musically this is fantastic. It's a very soft, very simple song with soft vocals in front of a piano to start, with drums that pick up and get the song moving about a minute in. The lyrics are great too. This came in as my second favorite track on the album.

I look forward to seeing what else this band can do in the future.",1464048000,4

75689,14487,4425,"I love most of Casting Crowns music, but I ordered this song because I'm leading a Celebrate Recovery 12 Step group, and Just Be Held is a song about being overwhelmed in life, and finally getting to the point where you let go and let God.  It's letting the listener know how life can just drive you to the brink of giving up on yourself by trying to make everyone else happy, or to take care of all of their business while you're leaving yourself behind.  They sing, ""Just Be Held""....and tell the listener to just let God hold you in His arms and that way you get to take a breather and really let Him minister to your weary soul.  It's a great reminder of the rest we can find in letting God deal with our crazy lives, and that no matter how much we think we're in control of others or life, we only have control over us.  And that's why I love this song, that's why I want everyone to hear this song and love this song, not just for the music and the words, but with the hope that whoever hears this song will be able to take it's advice to heart and let God hold them in His arms so healing can start.",1464048000,5

It's got a GREAT sound that I just loved. I had no idea who Brett Dennen was before today. I've spent much of today looking for new music on Amazon just to check out. This album wowed me with it's simplicity and just put me in a great mood. It immediately earned a place on my phone as a full download.

The lyrics aren't always positive but the music behind them just improved my outlook on the day. It just flows through me in a totally hard to describe way.

It's got a very unique sound that I don't know what I'd compare it with. It's just hard to describe what this sounds like. It's kind of combining multiple genres into something new, without being exactly like any of the inspirational sounds.

It's perfect for chilling out to on a Saturday afternoon and just letting the music flow through you. It's simple vocals with a hypnotic band doing it's thing in the background. It just makes me want to go outside and enjoy life.

Cassidy is a great song that is just a full meal for my ears. I absolutely loved this track. It's one of my favorites. It's one of those songs that just forces me to move around and enjoy the music.

Where We Left off is another track that really wowed me. It's very very simple with soft vocals and a guitar with a subtle drum beat in the background. It's beautiful music. The lyrics are pure poetry.",1464048000,5

I played this song at a women's study at a lesson where we were going to learn about God and try to instill an assurance in the ladies hearts that God is unfailing, always loving and never ending, and this song really touches the hearts of everyone present!  It's really a spiritual anthem that moves your heart to reach out and seek The King of King and Lord of Lord because He is He who says He is!  This is really a great tune, and I remember when Mark played this song at the concert he said it was brand new and it was one of the first times he was playing it, but that he couldn't wait to get it recorded because he felt it was so special.

75738,13898,1424,"""Whistle"" is a song by American rapper Flo Rida from his fourth album Wild Ones (2012). It was released on April 24, 2012 as the third single from the album. ""Whistle"" was written by Flo Rida, David Glass, Marcus Killian, Justin Franks, Breyan Isaac and Antonio Mobley while production was handled by DJ Frank E and Glass. It is a song about oral sex.
""Whistle"" is a pop-rap song characterized by a whistling melody. Upon its release, the song received mostly mixed reviews from music critics. They generally praised its pop sound, noting that it had the potential of becoming another hit with its ""catchy"" hook. However, several critics gave a negative review for the lyrics, interpreted as a thinly veiled euphemism for oral sex, calling it ""the least subtle song ever"". The song peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Flo Rida's third number one hit and his first since 2009's ""Right Round"".[2] ""Whistle"" was a commercial success, topping the charts in some countries, including Australia, Israel and Sweden, and peaked within the top ten of the charts in others, including Denmark, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom.
An accompanying music video for the song, directed by Marc Klasfeld, was released on May 24, 2012. It was filmed in Acapulco, Mexico and makes use of split screen at various points. It mostly shows shots of Flo Rida and several girls on a beach. Upon its release, it received positive to mixed reviews from critics, who noted that it was a perfect accompaniment for the song. Flo Rida also promoted the song by performing it during the finale of the talent show, The Voice. This song is the second track on Now 44. The cover image of the single also drew praise for its subtlety and originality.",1464134400,5

75760,3512,16066,"The lonely trumpet that opens Escondidos second album suggests another round of Lee Hazlewood-Ennio Morricone mashups. But the sparse, DIY live sound of their debut has given way to heavier, more studied productions here, and though vocalist Jessica Maros can still strike a mood of detachment, shes pushed by the music to a fiercer emotion. Think of Debbie Harry fighting her way out of a momentary lapse into ennui rather than Hope Sandoval getting lost in it. The opening Footprints includes chanting that echoes the tribal weight of Adam & The Ants, and the albums first single, Heart is Black, is as insinuous as the addictions it essays.

This is a decidedly more modern album than 2013s&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ghost-of-Escondido/dp/B00C6FTO9A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ghost of Escondido</a>, but the trade from desert spaces to studio layers hasn't sacrificed the duos mystery, nor obscured the power of their duet singing. The twanging riff and ghostly vocalization that introduce Idiot set up a kiss-off whose lack of anger adds to the sting. Maros and her multi-instrumentalist partner Tyler James manage to make music thats fragile and strong and disaffected and focused all at once. Maros can say shes over it, but the melody says otherwise, and James subtle (and not so subtle) touches of keyboards and trumpets point in both directions.

The albums title is taken from the song Apartment, recognizing the estrangement that can grow alongside familiarity. Its that sort of duality that colors the albums betrayal and recriminations, and the musics intensity draws from the conflict. The grounding in 90s alt-rock gives the album muscle, but the duos country and western (as opposed to Country & Western) roots carry the songs to an original place. Fans of Mazzy Star will be hooked, as they were for the debut, but just as quickly find themselves transported byond. Maros and James each bring something unique to their pairing, and paired, they're mesmerizing. [2016 Hyperbolium]",1464134400,4

There's 19 tracks here and not one rotten apple in the bunch. Billy oozes talent and these songs are evident of it. The way he sings, the way he composes, the way he arranges these timeless tracks is impeccable. You get a little bit of everything here with songs like ""Only Good Die Young"", ""It's Still Rock and Roll to Me"", ""Movin' Out (Anthony's Song)"", and ""You May Be Right"" which were big hits earlier in his career. You get some of his later hits like ""The Longest Time"", ""Tell Her About It"". ""We Didn't Start the Fire"", and ""The River of Dreams"". The reason I purchased this album was to get my grubby little hands on ""Pressure"". That song is genius! Like I said, EVERY TRACK is well written and well-sung. I highly recommend it.

75780,1758,17405,"With 2015s Shadows in the Night, Bob Dylan surprised us all with unique and compelling takes on some of the best songs the Great American Songbook has to offer. The record was a haunting, cohesive effort that also had some of his best singing in years. While normally not one to follow the same path for too long, the now 75 year old troubadour has followed up with another selection of Sinatra-esque standards, Fallen Angels.

Despite the ominous title, Fallen Angels is a generally lighter affair than Shadows in the Night, which was exclusively torch songs. Here, Dylan diversifies the palette a little, with lighthearted takes on classics such as Young at Heart, the silly but charming Polka Dots and Moonbeams, and wily rendition of That Old Black Magic, which is the most fun Dylan seems to have had on record since Love and Theft. He even shows his romantic side, particularly on a wonderful take on the classic All the Way. What he lacks in matching Sinatras smoothness of tone he makes up for in terms of beauty, emotionality and phrasing, all of which are top-notch here.

Vocally, Dylan is once again on top form here, sounding surprisingly smooth throughout and rising to notes he hasn't been able to hit in years. His readings are uniformly impassioned, and the arrangements are appropriate and effective. Fallen Angels won't go down as a genre-defining masterpiece, but its a an extremely solid effort that showcase the Master on top of his latest game.",1464134400,5

His brand of music is like no other that I have ever heard before and his voice the same.  He made this release to be one of a kind, and it was.  Just like his past recordings, he owned it all and I am soooo glad to be a part of his legion that will forever miss this talent taken too soon, yet have recordings that I will continue to play forevermore.

75880,11239,17429,"At this point Im calling this my album of the year-every song puts you in a place where Rock and Roll survives- its like a combination of the Rolling Stones, Lou Reed and the Pixies -an exceptional achievement that screams ' WE ARE HERE ' . The bands 2 previous albums are hard to top, but they've managed to do so. The music is what grabs you-it is 5 guys playing like a rock and roll orchestra . The songs show what happens when 4 of the 5 band members write and sing- everything goes together but nothing sounds the same. If forced , my favorite song would be Have You Ever- I feel like that discounts the rest of the songs by saying favorite song. The entire album is a collection of crafted  and layered music with songs catchy as ever. Saw these dudes on this tour 5 days after the albums release and their constant touring has honed them into a unit of pure rock and roll entertainment-stage presence, playing and ready to take over the world. If I were to have a gripe about this album it would be that it doesn't last for forever. A truly exceptional work of music and joy. This album shows why these guys are the new vanguards of rock and roll. If you haven't seen them live, your life is not complete",1464220800,5

75899,524,17503,"""Life Sometimes"" is the second full-length album by pianist/composer Sarah Dukes. Her first collection of original piano solos, ""Finding Forever,"" is made up of pieces Dukes  composed before graduating from high school, so this new album shows the growth and maturity of a composer who has experienced several more years of life on the planet. The fourteen original piano solos on Life Sometimes were arranged and performed by Yaron Gershovsy, also a pianist/composer as well as the musical director of The Manhattan Transfer. Overall, the music is melodic, graceful, and very expressive. Straightforward and relatively uncomplicated, it communicates from one heart to another without a lot of flash, but with a ton of sincerity.

""Life Sometimes"" begins with Stargaze, a gently-flowing piece that conveys dreamy,  hypnotic feelings of contentment. Violet Beams is warm and peaceful like a morning walk in spring. Rainbows and Crystals spins a story of magical wonderment - perhaps a fairy tale told to a young child. One of my favorites, As the Wind Blows is in constant motion - sometimes fast and lively, sometimes slower and more calm. Just Because is a buoyant expression of joy that seems to float on air. The title track is another favorite. Reflective with a sense of moving forward (I know thats kind of a conflict, but it works in this piece!), I like the main theme as well as the changing rhythms. Expressive and poignant, An Angel Returns tells a gentle, heartfelt story without the use of words. The Road Up Ahead feels a bit anxious, perhaps expressing fear of the unknown. It isn't pessimistic - just a bit uncertain. The piece becomes somewhat more turbulent and agitated as it develops, but then calms and returns to the original theme. My favorite piece on the album is Dancing In the Dark. Passionate and expressive, the rolling left hand broken chords propel the expressive, colorful melody forward - love it!  One is the original solo version of this piece, which was also orchestrated and released as a single. Itwas composed in honor of Leiby Kletzky, a young boy who was kidnapped and murdered on his way home from day camp. Dukes was inspired to composeOneafter seeing thousands of people mobilize to help the family search for their beloved son. Its a touching and affecting closing to the album.

""Life Sometimes"" is an impressive second effort from Sarah Dukes! Recommended!",1464220800,5

75968,3287,17405,"I can think of only a few musical artists who can do whatever the bleep they want and not lose fans, and may even gain some when they step out of their usual style. I can think of Van Morrison, Willie Nelson, Tony Bennett, Yo Yo Ma, and Dolly Parton. There is no question that Bob Dylan is at or near the top of that list. Thus we have ""Fallen Angels."" I admit, while I usually buy Dylan the moment new stuff comes out, I had no interest in his last album, which contained covers of songs made famous by Frank Sinatra. That was not because of Dylan; it was because I just don't like Frank Sinatra. This album, ""Fallen Angels"", comprised of mainstream standards written by some of this country's greatest songwriters of the 30's up into the early 60's. This album works. This album is a great album.
On ""Fallen Angels"", Dylan surrounds himself with a small group of very talented musicians. To a certain degree it has the ""live in the studio"" feel. I admit I was surprised by how good Dylan's voice sounded, given the obvious deterioration over his last few new albums. I was also impressed with his phrasing and elocution of the lyrics. The man really can sing, that talent often hidden by the power of his own lyrics and the quality of the music produced by whatever band with which he is working.
I listened to the entire album about five times before I felt ready to write this review. It was on my most recent listen, as ""Young At Heart"" was playing, that I realized that Bob was really ""into"" this music and that he sang such that it was clear to me he believed the words he was singing. I think that song in particular is fitting for BD as he celebrates his 75th birthday. The quality of the album is very even, in production, in song choice, in arrangements and in performance. For that reason, I find it hard to pick out any particular tracks as ""standouts"" on this album. I will say that in addition to ""Young At Heart,"" I particularly enjoyed his renditions of ""That Old Black Magic"", ""Come Rain or Come Shine,"" ""All or Nothing at All,"" and
""Melancholy Mood.""
This is a very good album and increases our appreciation of Dylan as the gift to the music world that he is. Highest recommendation.",1464220800,5
75969,5675,17241,"I had some mixed feelings when this album came outeagerness to hear more from a band capable of OK Computer, and worry that itd be more like the boring parts of The King of Limbs. And Ive been a little tight on money lately. So I waited to buy it for a whole eight hours or so after it went on sale.

Sure enough, A Moon Shaped Pool isn't Radioheads best albumbut its in the top three or four, and thats more than we have any right to expect at this stage in their career.

Thom Yorke recently split from his partner of twenty-three years, and with this, hes given us his Blood on the Tracks, a magnificent later-career breakup opus, as personal a statement as were likely to get from this resolutely private public figure. It also feels like a Pixies tribute. The tracks are sequenced in alphabetical order, which Frank Black et. al. sometimes used to do during their concerts. And (as was the case on OK Computer) theres an enigmatic and beautiful song about an alien visitation, something the Pixies did to great effect on The Happening. Here, its the gorgeous Decks Dark, with plain lyrics perfectly sketching out the larger emotions of overwhelming dread. And in your life, there comes a darkness. Theres a spacecraft blocking out the sky. And theres no way to hide. You run to look back, and you cover your ears, but its the loudest sound youve ever heard. Simple words, but stunningly effectivedepressing, but so awesome they're somehow inspiring, too.

Negative emotions have always been Thom Yorkes stock in trade; Vegas should offer prop bets on how many times hell use the word panic in his next album, but Im sure the over-under will be up in the teens, at least. So one cant entirely complain about getting more of the same here. Still, you worry about the guy. How can someone who sings so beautifully be so miserable? (Id like to think Id be happy if Id given the world what he has, but who knows?) But its an entirely pleasant misery, and tremendously comforting (for me, at least) after the tedious final tracks of The King of Limbs.

Like all their best work, it takes dozens of listens to unpack it all, and you fall in love with a new part every time: the lush strings on Tinker Tailor Soldier Sailor Rich Man Poor Man Beggar Man Thief, the delicate excitement of Ful Stop, the mournful strings that help Glass Eyes turn a simple train commute into a suffocating ordeal, the aching ghostly howl of Present Tense, the way the instruments at the end of Daydreamers sound like a mildly angry rhinoceros. Granted, there are parts Im less enamored withthe Nick Drake-esque Desert Island Disk is a bit of a letdown, and Identikit features Thom singing broken hearts make it rain, which is, frankly, a relatively awful lyric, no matter how many times Yorke repeats it. In fact, itd be unforgivable if the song on the whole wasn't so amazing, with the band firing on all cylinders, and Johnny Greenwood unleashing a skittering electronic spider of a guitar solo that somehow wordlessly encapsulates the bands whole ethos.

All in all, this is an amazing album, one that succeeds in spite of (and even because of) its few moments of weakness. But it isn't all new songs; theres a few here thatve been reworked over time, most obviously True Love Waits, but also Burn the Witch and Present Tense. So for all the ""Blood on the Tracks"" vibe, there's maybe a little Tattoo You,"" too. Which leaves us the question: are we still entitled to some mixed feelings about this band? Theyve already given us so much that theyve staked out a fair claim as a generation-defining band, one thats continued to make amazing music well into middle age. (For all my beef with The King of Limbs, there are still a few great songs on it, and when you throw in In Rainbows and this, the past nine years have given us two amazing albums and an EP in LPs clothing, which is, again, more than we should rightfully expect.) But if they can only reach those heights nowadays by digging into the vaults and reworking some old stuff, my inner paranoid android says this heralds a couple decades of 80s-Stones mediocrity, of money-grabbing tours and albums devoid of inspiration. Now thats truly cause for panic.",1464220800,5
75970,5099,17405,Great !!!!!!,1464220800,5
75971,821,8485,I use this song as my alarm because it starts off slow and then it slowly builds up. It's like a soft electronica song that builds up to a dance chorus. Some have argued that twenty one pilots are a Christian band and I could actually see that with the lyrics in this song. It talks about a figure in the trees watching over and I can't help but think that's a reference to Christ. It may or might not be but either way I think that this song would  be welcomed by a wide range of people who have various interests. I enjoy this song because of the slow start that builds up.,1464220800,5

No.  But he actually does a very credible job here.

And I was also surprised at how laid back the songs on this release are.  Like I said - it is like he channeled Leon Redbone.

76089,634,17527,"Prime Cuts: Should Have Been Mine, Brother (Featuring TobyMac), Great Are You Lord

Historically, Integrity Music has always chartered for congregational worship via albums produced by megachurches (Planetshakers, Hillsong) or prominent internationally renowned worship leaders (Darlene Zschech, Paul Baloche).  Rarely have they taken a fancy for more ""individualistic"" artists unless they are extremely sublime.  Case in point being the recent signings of the Brilliance and All Sons and Daughters.  Add to this prestigious tally is Seth and Nirva.  The couple are not actually newbies as far as Christian music is concerned. Nirva was a member of the renowned Fisk Jubilee Singers and has also been a featured vocalist with such artists as Mandisa, Natalie Grant and Nicole C. Mullen, among many others. Seth, on the other hand, began his singing career with Gospel music guru Kirk Franklin. Seth's vocal talent has also supported the likes of Donnie McClurkin, CeCe Winans and Chris Tomlin, among others.

Produced by Bryan Fowler (tobyMac, Aaron Shust) and featuring song writing collaborations with Michael Farren (""Let It Rain""), Mia Fields (""Savior King""), Jacob Sooter, Israel Houghton, tobyMac, Victor Oquendo and BJ Putnam, Seth & Nirva's faith-empowering ""Never Alone"" picks up where their 2013 EP ""I Need You"" left off. For starters, the first thing to say about ""Never Alone"" is that Seth and Nirva are not locked in to any style of worship.  Album opener ""You Are in Control"" is a slice of delicious pop with its skittering drum beat and a hooky chorus.  ""Pour It Out,"" on the other hand, has a brassy-horns-led Motown R&B feel where Nirva croons with a Diana Ross-esque lilt over a Jesus-exalting words.

Those who hunger for more traditional congregation worship would love the couple's take of All Sons and Daughters' ""Great Are You Lord.""  Bringing in a tingle of reggae in the song's bridge, Seth and Nirva certainly add signature to this beloved worship ballad.  Nirva makes a bull's eye for the heart of the Gospel with the beautiful ""Should Have Been Mine,"" a Biblically informed exposition of Jesus and his sacrifice.  Labelmate Brilliance's ""Brother"" where the couple sings in tandem with former boss TobyMac is another highlight.  ""Brother"" is quickly become a modern day worship classic that speaks of how Christ revolutionizes our relationships, including how we need to forgive like Christ forgives us.  Seth and Nirva's deliveries are just spot on:  measuredly restrain yet poignantly nuanced.

""We Won't Back Down,"" on the other hand, is an ear-opener.  Utilizing a pulsating EDM drumline, ""We Won't Back Down,"" though not perfect melodically or lyrically, is the couple's foray into electronica.  Much better is the title cut ""Never Alone"" which is meeting of a trio of musical streams: atmospheric balladry, R&B, and rap.  ""Never Alone"" is not your typical Gospel or Christian album.  It's a potpourri of styles, influences, and traditions undergirding well-crafted and God-centered lyrics.",1464307200,4

76131,18,17404,"If you asked me fifteen years ago what my favorite bands were, Travis was right up there (along with Coldplay and Oasis). 1999's ""The Man Who"" was a flawless, PERFECT album, and 2001's ""The Invisible Band"" came close to that. Then began the long slide downwards. Still some good moments here and there, but 2008's ""Ode to J. Smith"" was simply a head-scratcher (and major commercial disappointment). The band must've heard the message loud and clear as they withdrew from the music scene for quite a long time. When they finally resurfaced in 2013 with the 'come-back' album ""Where You Stand"", Fran and the boys sounded reinvigorated. Now another 3 years later comes the band's latest (8th) studio album.

""Everything At Once"" (10 tracks; 33 min.) opens with the mid-tempo and warm ""What Will Come"" . It is followed by ""Magnificent Time"" (3rd UK single; co-written with Kean's Tim Rice-Oxley), and sounding glorious. ""Radio Song"" is a nice rocker (and 4th UK single) and would've fitted perfectly on the 1997 ""Good Feeling"" album. When I heard ""Paralysed"" for the first time, I immediately thought ""Muse!"". Side A closes with one of two songs from bassist Dougie Payne ""Animals"" is a bit tentative for me. His ""Everything At Once"" (1st UK single) opens Side B and is the much better of the two. ""3 Miles High"" (2nd UK single) is a nice mid-tempo tune, with Fran's soothing vocals upfront. Later on we get ""Idlewild,"" a duet with singer/songwriter Josephine Oniyama. But the best is saved for the very last: album-closing ""Strangers On a Train"" (written by guitarist Andy Dunlop) is an epic tune (and at 5 min. by far the longest track on here). Bottom line: ""Everything At Once"" is short and sweet and continues the resurgence of Travis started with ""Where You Stand"".

I've had the good fortune of seeing Travis in concert a number of times over the years, including multiple times during their peak years (2000-03). Most recently I saw them at the Corona Capital festival in Mexico City (Mexico's equivalent of Coachella) in the Fall of 2013, when they were touring behind ""Where You Stand"". The guys put on a 60 min. set that was a mix of old and new, but it were the old classics that got the greatest response from the massive crowd. So far no tour dates have been announced for North America this year, I can only hope that changes! Meanwhile, ""Everything At Once"" is worth checking out for Travis fans, old and new.",1464307200,4

76134,2635,17534,"Thrice continues to make spectacular music even after they went on hiatus to focus on family life. The band is known for experimenting a bit past the typical post-hardcore sound, and that is something that you get with this disc. From this being a bar none politically and socially aware album to the point where one of the songs on here, ""Whistleblower"", is about Edward Snowden (a guy often labeled as a whistleblower in politics), to the fact that lyrically and musically the band still keeps the unique side of them alive and well, this is an album that truthfully brings Thrice back into the world without attempting to recreate any one album and just let it be that. Tracks such as ""The Window"", ""Black Honey"", ""Wake Up"", and ""Blood On The Sand"" exhibit how well this album goes over. Even at its weakest, this is still, once again, a must hear album. Only better things are expected out of this band in the future.

When beggars came out, it was cool and it was different. A sound that was new for them, but then Major/minor comes out and It could easily have been mistaken as beggars. The sound was so similar and this is what plagues the new album.

The band has gotten into this ""just ok"" phase. The early albums had a punch you in the face intensity and the albums to follow matured into a deep and passionate approach. Now a days, its just like whatever. I find the new album very underwhelming.

76179,1108,74,"Like many, I was introduced to Imagine Dragons by their hit ""Radioactive,"" which proved popular enough that it was not only included on the soundtrack to the movie ""The Host,"" but was covered by Pentatonix and parodied by ""Weird Al"" Yankovic.  At first I thought it would be a case of ""I just like one song by this group,"" but when I listened to their song ""Warriors,"" I knew I would like this band.  I'm normally not a fan of modern rock, but Imagine Dragons is quickly proving to be the exception, and their album ""Night Visions"" has really grown on me.

Of the songs on this album, ""Radioactive"" and ""On Top of the World"" would have to be my favorite songs.  The former is a thunderous and raw song, but strangely hopeful despite the dystopian, post-apocalyptic theme of it.  ""On Top of the World"" is quite different, a livelier and upbeat number that wouldn't be out of place in a Dreamworks movie.  Both songs have hooked me, and evoke very different but still powerful emotions every time I listen to them.

Other favorites on this album include the pop-flavored ""Tip Toe,"" the powerful ""Demons,"" and the more subdued but still thoughtful and pleasant ""Amsterdam.""  Other songs, such as ""Underdog"" and ""Bleeding Out,"" aren't necessarily bad, they just weren't my favorites of the album.  Still, overall this album has far more hits than misses for me.  Imagine Dragons has a powerful sound to it that can be raw, melancholy, upbeat, or mellow as they see fit, and they've certainly proven to be a great band with this album.

If you like bands such as Linkin Park or Dashboard Confessional, you'll probably enjoy ""Night Visions.""  Give it a shot.  This band is going far if they keep up this sound quality.",1464393600,4

76190,3161,16650,"Sometimes in the world of metal a person wants the real deal - while black, prog, death, etc. all have their strengths and weaknesses, it's a good thing there are still metal outfits out there who are the foundation of the genre that helps to keep it somewhat centered, as many nowadays have gone the route of metalcore, with screaming, tuneless and hookless guitar noises, blast beat drums that destroy any sense of tempo and melody.
  Metal Church are veterans of the U.S. early '80s scene that fostered the thrash movement, the Big 4 and other worthy outfits who didn't reach the commercial heights of the Big 4, but in many cases were much better.  Metal Church was a Seattle contribution to the era, had ties with Metallica, even loaning one time lead guitarist John Marshall to substitute for James Hetfield, who had injured his arm and temporarily was unable to play guitar.
  Kurt Vanderhoof remains the last original member, but was the founder and principle songwriter, so the Metal Church sound remains intact.  That sound is one part thrash, a couple parts Judas Priest, and is about as no frills straight up classic metal as you can get.  After original vocalist David Wayne left, and later died, Mike Howe entered the picture with a couple great albums, ""Blessing in Disguise"" and ""The Human Factor"" among them.  He left, other band members departed, but now he's back with Vanderhoof for XI, a grand return to form for these metal veterans.
  His voice is strong, has its own unique tone, and the band burn with the intensity of past glories like ""Metal Church"", one of the great underrated metal anthems from the first album, ""Ton of Bricks"" and ""The Final Word"", thrashing headbangers if there ever were any.  A better production this time around, the energy that has rekindled this band and some fine songwriting and hooks make ""XI"" a damn good album - jackhammer rhythms, some really cool hooks, like ""Signal Path"" and tight playing make one wonder why these guys, like lots of other outfits including Laaz Rockit, Forbidden, and Whiplash couldn't have had the breaks they deserved, but we can right one wrong by getting this latest from a good batch of metal warriors.",1464393600,5

76243,3202,17407,"Tom Petty & Co. are back after eight years with their second outing, ""2"". I liked it better than the first, and it's refreshing to have all members contribute vocally and lyrically. It makes for a reasonably diverse listening experience.

""Trailer"", ""Dreams Of Flying"", ""Beautiful World"", ""I Forgive It All"", ""The Other Side Of The Mountain"", ""Welcome To Hell"" and ""Victim Of Circumstance"" are all standouts.

Somebody needs to reel Tom in on the six minute numbers ""Beautiful Blue"" and ""Hungry No More"". They were overlong, and let's face it, not that great. The other Petty tracks that felt like filler were ""Hope"" and ""Save Your Water"".

Essentially, I liked this Mudcrutch album better than the last Heartbreakers album, so what does that tell you? Perhaps Petty should keep on with Mudcrutch instead?

Here's how ""2"" compares with Petty's other works:

Their last album wasn't that great and you can tell that the band went back to the drawing board to make sure they wouldn't repeat the same mistakes. Loud guitars, loud drums, loud vocals, you get the idea. If your hoping that this album will stand on par with their earlier material then you may be disappointed however, I will say this is most certainly one of their better later career albums. I know sticking to the old stuff makes most people happy but after a while your going to get bored and crave something new. If you're already a fan of this group then this album is for you.

76317,3315,17557,"I nearly didn't buy this because of some of the uninformed reviews posted here about the release, but I decided to go with my first impulse, and I'm glad I did. For starters, let's make this clear -- these are NOT re-recordings of the original music for the series. THIS IS THE ORIGINAL MUSIC FOR THE SERIES AS COMPOSED AND RECORDED in 1966 by Dominic Frontiere in Munich (it's a long story, told in the notes). It may not all sound familiar, as it was the music editor who chose and edited the recordings at hand for use in actual episodes of the series; and yes, the music that THE RAT PATROL shared with Frontiere's music from THE OUTER LIMITS (and some of that was also shared with episodes of 12 O'CLOCK HIGH -- also a Frontiere-scored series) is NOT here, as that material was obviously tracked in from the UA music library by the music editor; this CD is limited to what was written and recorded FOR the series in Munich). But this is the original music as written and recorded for the series. And it's great -- you can hear overlaps in mood with some of the Outer Limits material that some people are looking for, but there's also a lot here that's new. And as Frontiere was writing music to cover an entire season (at least) of a TV series, there are a lot of different moods and tones, intended to fit scenes that he had not ever seen (he says all he ever saw was the script for the pilot episode, which had actually been scored by Alex North, whose involvement with the series ended over problems with its creator and the studio -- the notes explain it, but it was not any fault of North's).

The sound is excellent, the listening thoroughly enjoyable, and the release most welcome. One does wish, however, that annotator Jon Burlingame had spent a little more time checking some of  his ancillary facts (Note to Jon: 12 O'CLOCK HIGH was a series about World War II BOMBER pilots and their crews, NOT fighter pilots). And one of the ironies in the notes concerns comments by Walter Mirisch, whose company was partnered with UA in the series -- UA's stinginess cost themselves millions in revenue in syndication, but the series itself cost its star a lot more; Christopher George developed chronic heart problems from the extended shooting in desert environs that eventually took his life. Anyway, the CD is worth the money.",1464480000,5

76329,898,17444,"This Is What You Came For by Calvin Harris feat. Rihanna struck a cord within my soul when I first heard this superb song because of the bright mood vibe music and the musical stories that the writer in me envisions from just this one song. I understand that a completely different music video could arise from what I imagine the song to be about, especially because of my awareness that this song could actually hold a completely different meaning depending on who hears this song. The writer in me for some reason sees This Is What You Came For by Calvin Harris feat. Rihanna being about a man or woman who is the center of attention either in social, professional, and/or romantic settings by several people but the person who is the center of attention actually has an interest in someone else that does not pay the same amount of attention to them as the others do for whatever reason.

Adele vocal is strong and powerful.

this song is about a man who promised to love her forever and ned up falling in love with someone else. she is more ""free"". she was too fast for him and the two weren't a match. it has a ""i m glad you're gone "" feels  while wishing the best of luck to her ex boyfriend.

76373,1180,17222,"I'm not a country music fan but there is some that I like.  I've been a Cyndi Lauper fan since I was a kid, and buy everything she releases.  I was kind of disappointed when I heard she'd be making a country album of all things.  Though it's not a big surprise given that she has made several covers albums.  Cyndi has always done covers of songs, even with Blue Angel and on her solo albums.

I knew if anyone could make a country album I might like, she could, so I pre-ordered.  I also bought the individual tracks that were released before the CD.  Cyndi has a way of adding humor and seriousness to her recordings.  I figured she would put some funny touches here and there with this one, and she does.  I'm previously familiar with some of the songs, while others I never heard.

1.  ""Funnel of Love""-Upbeat and almost rockabilly sound, reminds me of an amusement park on a summer day.  I like this one, it's catchy.  It gets stuck in my head but in a good way.  I like singing along to it.  A great opening track.  5/5
2.  ""Detour"" (featuring Emmylou Harris)-This isn't as good as the first track, but I like it.  Vintage sounding.  This has a sound of classic country music from the past.  Their voices sound good.  This is a song I would've hated when I was a kid, because it has that country twang that most non-country fans don't like, but I like it now.  4/5
3.  ""Misty Blue""-A nice ballad, sad, good fit for Cyndi's serious side.  It fits in her catalog with some other ballads she's done.  Melancholy.  5/5
4.  ""Walkin' After Midnight""-The classic Patsy Cline song that we all know.  Cyndi does it justice.  She doesn't stray too far from the original.  I don't know if Patsy fans would like it, I tend to enjoy Patsy's more too, but I love this one also.  One of my favorites on the album.  5/5
5.  ""Heartaches by the Number""-The first song released from the album.  Catchy and kind of fun.  One of the more memorable tracks here.  5/5
6.  ""The End of the World""-I already knew this song as an oldies tune from the 50s.  I never knew it was a country song.  It's never been a favorite of mine, and Cyndi's version isn't much different.  But I prefer Cyndi's cover.  3/5
7.  ""Night Life"" (featuring Willie Nelson)-This one is okay.  Willie Nelson's voice sounds different than what I'm used to, since I'm not familiar with his more recent work.  It's not a song I'll play often.  3/5
8.  ""Begging to You""-Another good one.  Another somewhat sad ballad.  Like all the songs here, Cyndi makes it her own.  5/5
9.  ""You're the Reason Our Kids Are Ugly"" (featuring Vince Gill)-I feel I should explain my low rating of this track.  This song is kind of funny about a squabbling couple who pick on each other but stay together because in the end they love each other.  But the title of the song bothers me a little, because I have a personal childhood trauma involving getting bullied as a small child and one girl always calling me names including ""ugly"" for no reason other than that she was cruel and vicious.  So I kind of feel bad listening to a song saying kids are ugly.  Even though I get the humor and message of the song.  I like that they are saying looks and money don't matter.  But it's my least favorite song on the album.  2/5
10.  ""I Fall to Pieces""-I really like this one.  I knew the original but I think I like this version better.  It's a very good cover.  5/5
11.  ""I Want to Be a Cowboy's Sweetheart"" (featuring Jewel)-I used to be a Jewel fan (still like some of her songs).  I'm not a fan of yodeling, but it suits this song so I don't mind it.  The part when Cyndi says, ""Yippee Ay Yay"" mid-way through the song is hilarious.  It's one of those Cyndi moments that is classic Cyndi Lauper and just makes you laugh!  Cyndi's voice sounds different during the song, but when that part comes in, she sounds like Cyndi from the 80s.  5/5
12.  ""Hard Candy Christmas"" (featuring Alison Krauss)-I wasn't familiar with Dolly's version before hearing this.  I know of the film but have never watched the entire movie because it doesn't interest me.  I already have the single version of this, which has Cyndi solo on the vocals while this one is a duet.  I like the solo one better but there isn't much difference.  If you're like me and don't care about the film or story, the song has it's own meaning.  This is a nice, but again sad, song about a woman in tough times thinking of making changes in her life and doing things, but not really sure she will.  Maybe I'll do this, maybe I'll try that.  Leaves you wondering if she does or not.  It's relatable to anyone unsure of what they are doing in life.  5/5

Overall I enjoy the album.  The highlights are Funnel of Love, Walkin' After Midnight, Heartaches by the Number, and I Fall to Pieces.  Cyndi's voice still sounds the same-she's always been able to interpret songs in various ways.  At times on Detour, like on I Want to be a Cowboy's Sweetheart, she sounds very different.  But it works.  I think this album is a lot better than Memphis Blues.  While there are some songs on there that I like, I hardly listen to it.  It's been interesting to see how Cyndi has tried many genres.  Who would have thought back in the 80s and early 90s that she would one day do a country record.  I like that it doesn't sound too modern, she stays true to old country music.  The retro sound works.

There are some fans who won't even give Detour a try because they dislike country, or because they didn't like Memphis Blues.  They want dance or pop Cyndi back.  I think Detour is very good and I'll be listening to it during the summer.  But I definitely would like to hear her do another album of original pop/rock songs, like her 80s albums or her dance album Bring Ya to the Brink from 2008.  Maybe she lost interest in that and wants to do as many different cover albums as she can.  But many of us fans would love to hear more original songs.",1464480000,4
76374,14206,12261,"Id never heard of Galantis when I stumbled across their album Pharmacy on Amazon Prime. Im usually pretty skeptical when I see and album is recommended for me, but in this case it was pretty spot-on.

If you love EDM, these songs are sheer ear candy. Theyre high energy tracks, and youll have a hard time staying in one place when you listen to them. They range from using subtle elements to in-your-face enthusiasm. I find the production detail to be amazing. It mustve taken months (year?) to layer these things!

Velvety vocals, catchy melodies, hooks thatll stay with you for weeks, you cant listen to this album and NOT dance. Highly recommended

76379,13482,2777,"I already had one of the finest versions of Ride the Lightning on CD as a basis for comparison. I hadn't been able to find many reviews on the new $18.99 vinyl.

I purchased this at B&N with a coupon in-store today, but will share with my Amazon brethren as I get 95% of my new vinyl here and love to add to the reviews that I myself greatly depend on.

I have decent mid-fi equipment, not really a reference system but certainly good enough to expose the quality of an inferior recording. 1978 Japanese Technics SL-220 with AT95e > TC750 > Yamaha RX-V377 > HD598 and the CD on the same RX and phones via Yamaha CDP-S300

I prefer the vinyl by a good margin, though the only fault I can find is the vocals are a little low in this mix. Record was dead flat (as in free of warps) drilled dead center, poly lined paper sleeve, lyrics sheet, download card. Before playing The record was cleaned with A.I. #6 via KABUSA EV-1. Very quiet background and dead silent between tracks, generous lead-in area and dead wax, I think the overall time is just a hair over 47:00.

It may be the most quiet metal record I own as far as background, and darn sure is the best for $18.99 or less. The record volume overall is a tad low but nothing that's not easily overcome by the volume control. I was impressed to the point that I will now seek out the new releases of Kill em All and Puppets, despite Puppets having some issues according to reviews.

So yeah, mix sounds nice and balanced, good bass, vocals recessed a tad, but not a big deal IMO. Very happy with the price/quality. Would recommend. Kill EM All is my favorite Thrash era Metallica and this album bridges the gab between that album and puppets.",1464480000,5

76389,898,6090,"Around 16 days ago,I admit that I felt an indescribable joy wash over me when my husband started spontaneously singing parts of the I Swear by All-4-One  to me when we were relaxing together. My husband singing this song out of the blue was special to me because he has actually been there for me through both the good and challenging times for me (since we met in August 2002 and our marriage on January 22, 2004), especially with a career change that was unexpectedly forced on me over five and a half months ago. However, much to my relief our marriage has only grown stronger and closer since then and I found it heartwarming that my husband decided to sing I Swear to me out of the blue to me first thing that morning (16 days ago). Additionally, I first heard I Swear by All-4-One during my teenage years via local radio and it had been a while since I last heard it. Anyhow, I Swear by All-4-One is a beautiful pop song about loving someone and being there for someone throughout both good fortune and tribulations in life (with the lyrics till death do us part).

These women wrote their own songs for the most part.  They played their own instruments.  You do not see much of that any more in this age.  They were a great band and are still touring as of this writing sans Michael Steele.  However, the girls are all together on this cd and it is a wonderful listen.

The song was pretty much forgotten until it was featured on the popular TV series ""Family Ties"" starring Micheal J. Fox in 1986.  Rhino records wisely decided to re-release the single in November of that year and it became a million seller and topped the charts for two weeks.  A memorable vocal performance by the veteran recording artist.",1464566400,4

76469,5355,17222,"In 2010 the fluorescent-haired girl who just wants to have fun, recorded an album of classic blues songs and even made a DVD of the performances. I love Cyndi and loved that album. Now, shes taking a stab at classic country songs (most made famous in the 1950s and 60s) in the 12 track album co-produced in Nashville with Tony Brown. Without seeing the track list, you can probably guess at least half the songs they chose. Patsy Clines I Fall to Pieces and Walkin After Midnight, Wanda Jacksons The Funnel of Love and (the CDs title song) Detour  with Emmylou Harris on harmony vocal)  and Skeeter Davis The End of The World.  Willie Nelson joins Lauder (and plays guitar) on his Night Life. One really not country song is Carol Halls song from the Broadway musical The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas  Hard Candy Christmas  but it sortta fits.

The one song that was definitely new to me is the novelty number Youre the Reason oOur Kids are Ugly which Lauper duets with Vince Gill.

Anyone familiar with Lauper knows that her singing voice is a LOT different than when she speaks (her thick Queens, NY accent ). And, its only during this song  when she and Gill are sharing dialogue  that you really KNOW its Cyndi. No one else sounds like that! But, heck, this is a fun song anyway.

The CD comes in a digipak with a 12-page color booklet with a 4-page essay by Lauper about the project and a page of song and track credits. No lyrics are provided. (But you probably know them anyway).

Lets see, blues in 2010, country in 2016. Whats planned for 2022? Cyndi does opera? Reggae?  Jazz?

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

76557,12176,13242,"Wouldn't think I would ever say this. But I think Queensryche is stronger without Geoff Tate. Sure he wrote one of the best metal concept albums of all time (operation mind crime). And other great albums Empire, Rage of Order, The Warning, Promised Land Ect. But the last few years with Tate have been very lackluster with their albums and creativity. Not saying it was Geoff Tates fault. My the vibe and magic of Queensryche and creativity seem to be back, Todd La Torre has just brought back magic left out of Queensryche in the last decade. He has amazing voice and sounds striking similar to Tate at times. Not really sure how much input in has with the making of the songs and music. But whatever he added its much needed. Starting with Todd's first album with the band self tilted. Bringing the vibe of earlier albums with a modern sound. This album Condition Human is even better. Sounding like Empire or Operation Mindcrime on steroids. This album may be Queensryche's heaviest record to date. Huge heavy metal riffs over Todd's soaring vocals. The songs all sound different but some how sound like their in the same vein. This album as more of a traditional heavy metal sound, then compared to the Avenged Sevnfolds, or Slipknots or even the Asking Alexanders out there. Which to some may sound dated but I find very refreshing. These songs have more melody than most young bands have or need. Very strong album maybe one of their best soon to be consider a modern classic. Check it out if your a Queensryche fan!",1464652800,5

Sometimes like with this album, just does not sound right coming from him and seemed force just to ""fit in"" with new rap lovers.

But a friend recently mentioned him, and when I saw this CD at a used book sale, I decided to purchase it for use in my yoga classes (I'm a new teacher).  I do like the music, but it's not exactly relaxing or meditative.  I would describe it as more powerful, often upbeat, yet haunting at times as well.  It has the feeling of both an orchestra but of Eastern influences as well.  There are some vocals, although they are more a chorus and fairly indistinct.  This definitely music that I can use for yoga, although during the more active phases of the class.  For someone who is new to both of these artists, I would recommend this album.",1464652800,4

76689,1484,17112,"I didn't even know this was coming out till I saw it on shelves. It makes sense that the record company and probably Rob Zombie himself had no faith in it being a great album... if you can even call it one. It's more of an EP. There is only about 5 or 6 songs on this, and the rest is either talking/radio cut filler crap, or some stupid short instrumental that doesn't even sound like J5 is even trying to tune into his talents.

There is 2 decent songs I don't mind. One being UFO and the other Get Your Boots On. Neither make any sense, or have much meaning, but when does Rob ever do that anyway? The UFO one I take a liking to because it reminds me of Jerry Reed, if you know who that is, and sounds like Jerry gone Rob Zombie style which is unusual, but makes me wonder what Rob would sound like covering ""East Bound and Down"" lol

The other stuff on here is easily forgetable. Not Rob's best work and the album just feels incomplete like the big singles are missing from it. I expect as per usual, Rob will try to rectify the negative reviews and bitter tastes in fans mouths left hungry for more by releasing a deluxe edition soon with a few more songs or a quick cover of something to fill in the 40-50 mins remaining of CD time this one here has left blank.",1464739200,2

76711,14672,1725,"I really hope that THE INEVITABLE END really isn't the end of Ryksopp, but even if it is, theyve had a good, long run of excellent tracks. On this album, they embrace their pop leanings even more fully, as Skulls kicks things off with a slab of darker-tinged electro, which soon enough turns bouncy. A more beat-driven version of Monument appears here too, as opposed to the softer version from DO IT AGAIN, while the softer Sordid Affair and Compulsion drizzle on some romance. The airy You Know I Have to Go floats around the atmosphere, before Save Me brings things back to earth. But I Had This Thing mixes the earthiness of the bass with the atmospherics for a track that straddles both worlds. Running to the Sea, their hit, is a blast of pure pop joy aimed directly at the dancefloor. But the quietly graceful Coup de Grace, leads into piano-driven Thank You, a gentle goodbye. But its not quite done yet: on the bonus disc, theres a bonus mix of Do It Again, which emphasizes the breaks, as well as four additional tracks, from the dreamy Goodnite, Mr. Sweetheart and the short, string quartet Oh No and finally to the mutant R&B of Something in My Heart.

76729,1726,17605,"This album is so significant that it deserves more information about Franz Waxman to back up how sensational his gift to the musical world remains. Franz Waxman led a variety of musical lives as composer, conductor and impresario. He was born in Konigshutte, Upper Silesia, Germany, on December 24, 1906, and was the youngest of six children. No one in the family was musical except Franz, who started piano lessons at the age of seven. His father was an industrialist, and not believing his son could earn a living in music, encouraged him in a banking career. He worked for two and a half years as a teller and used his salary to pay for lessons in piano, harmony and composition. He then quit the bank and moved to Dresden and then to Berlin to study music. During this period he paid for his musical education by playing piano in nightclubs and with the Weintraub Syncopaters, a popular jazz band of the late 1920s. While with the band he began to do their arrangements, and this led to orchestrating some early German musical films. Frederick Hollander, who had written some music for the Weintraubs, gave Waxman his first important movie assignment: orchestrating and conducting Hollanders score for Josef von Sternbergs classic film, The Blue Angel. The films producer, Erich Pommer, who was also head of the UFA Studios in Berlin, was so pleased with the orchestration of the score that he gave Waxman his first major composing assignment: Fritz Langs version of Liliom (1933) which was filmed in Paris after their exodus from Germany. Pommers next assignment, Jerome Kerns Music in the Air (Fox Films, 1934), took him to the United States, and he brought Waxman with him to arrange the music. Waxmans first original Hollywood score was James Whales The Bride of Frankenstein (1935), which led to a two-year contract with Universal as head of the music department. He scored a dozen of the more than 50 Universal films on which he worked as music director. Among the best known are Magnificent Obsession, Diamond Jim and The Invisible Ray. Two years after he went to Hollywood, Waxman, then 30, signed a seven-year contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to compose. He averaged about seven pictures a year, and it was during this period that he scored such famous Spencer Tracy films as Captains Courageous, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and Woman of the Year. In 1937, he was loaned by M-G-M to David O. Selznick for The Young at Heart and was nominated for both Best Original Music and Best Score  the first two of 12 Academy Award nominations he was to receive for the 144 films he scored in his 32 years in Hollywood. In 1940 he was again loaned to Selznick, this time for Rebecca, and was nominated for his third Academy Award. And on and on.

What this album celebrates is Waxmans inimitable movie songs in English but it also adds his superb cabaret songs sung in German. Robert Osborne is the superb vocalist and Richard Gordon partners him on the piano. Nostalgia and a renewed appreciation for cabaret songs as well as welcome back for this film music, this album is a complete joy. Grady Harp, June 16",1464739200,5

76755,8877,12324,"I am a Simon and Garfunkel faithful so I am extremely picky about this song.  I came across it accidentally when searching for the original.  I am so glad I did.  It is a really unique rendition with so much power and depth that I was drawn in.  Even at the end where the singer approaches screaming in his intensity, he maintains his musicality and keeps it in the realm of melodic song.  Throughout, the full rich voice manages to remain predominant over a very full orchestration - like how good coffee stands up to cream.  It is not an imitation but a unique and contemporary interpretation of the song that remains faithful to the melody while adding the artists own spin.",1464739200,5

So on DO IT AGAIN, she takes the vocal spotlight, starting off slow and electro with Monument, culminating in a subdued sax solo. But Sayit picks up the beats, and the title track delves into the pure pleasure of tech-pop. Every Little Thing returns to a slower tempo, before the long Inside the Idle Hour Club closes this mini-album on an ambient note. I cant wait for Royksopp to do it again.",1464739200,4

It looked for all the world like a star was born. Unfortunately, although she hit the Hot 100 eight more times over the next several years she could never come close to equaling the success of ""Good Thing"". Although it turns out that she was a ""one hit wonder"" this is a song definitely one worth remembering.  Now I am not exactly sure who is responsible for the sax work on this record but it is first rate.  An exceptional recording.",1464739200,5

She loved that man and counted him among her favorite performers. Since his music was on at house quite a lot I also became a fan. Over the years I have purchased a lot of his music including his work with the King Cole Trio in the 1940s and most of his big solo hits from the 1950s and 1960s. I don't think the man was capable of making a bad record. Of all of the songs he recorded my personal favorite is That Sunday, That Summer released in 1963. This moving love song written by Joe Sherman and George David Weiss reached #12 on the Billboard Hot 100 Singles chart.

76891,11082,16893,"This is just a fantastic CD.  I purchased the CD instead of the MP3 because I wanted to hear it in the best format available.  There are 5 brilliant songs on here that blow just about everything out of the water.  The remaining songs are also great but those 5 songs just destroy.  It is a bit cliched but done so well that I can ignore it.  Paul is an incredible singer and  really nailed this.  The production is crystal clear but has that edge of disaster feel to it.  Interestingly, I really enjoy the guitar playing on this.  Rob Marcello (?) can shred over almost anything but to play something that fits a song is tougher.  He has more matched emotion here.  It feels like he wrote the solos and riffs while in the a band writing session and not just laid onto a song from his home studio.  I realize this is how the record was made, but it sounds like they wrote and played in the same room.  This is not an easy thing to create.  I will be playing this one non-stop for months.  It gets better over time.  By the way, ""Little Miss Rock n Roll"" really grows on you.  There have been a bunch of complaints that this song does not fit - not true.  It has become my favorite song.  Crank this one in the car and you will want to drive right past your exit just to keep it going",1464825600,5

-Good songwriting.
-Excellent playing.
-Functional vocals (not bad, not great).

76924,10310,17621,"It sounds like Yngwie. That says a lot. This release is mostly instrumental with a few tracks with vocals. Yngwie handles the vocals and they actually fit the songs fairly  good. There is some really good playing on this release. I do wish he would hire a vocalist so he could concentrate strictly on his playing, but that is up to him and his checkbook. Yngwie brags about the spontaneity of his recordings, which may be good artistically, but the production suffers. His last few efforts have suffered from a very muddy sound production wise. This one is worlds better than Spellbound, but still struggles. The song World Is On Fire is very cool. It could make a good single if the sound was cleaned up. Lost In The Machine is a strong song also, other than production. Soldier is a struggle to get through. Yngwie repeats the same couple of lines over and over echoing himself EVERYTIME lol. Soldier is good musically, but vocals make it hard to listen to. All the other tracks are instrumentals. They all sound like good songs, just muddy. I do wish Yngwie would hire a producer or at least a co-producer. Like I said the whole disc sound more like demos than final productions. I prefer his albums with more songs with vocals, but that doesn't detract from his talent. He is not a good producer or mixer in my opinion. I believe this is a 3.5 star release. Suffers mainly from poor production and sound quality. Yngwie, you wrote some very good songs here, now just get them to sound right.",1464825600,4

76929,14695,6271,"I love the songs and music of Matthew West, and the song ""Day One"" is my favorite. It reminds me that today .....each day....is Day One of the rest of our lives. For me that is both a sobering and inspiring thought due to the fact, as we all know,  that our days on earth are numbered, and once the day has gone by it is gone, there is no way to go back and relive it or change it. Also we are not promised tomorrow. So this song reminds me to try to live each day to the fullest, to glorify the Lord who holds our times in His hand, and to live each day in such a way that I do not have to repent of ungodly actions or words that hurt my friends, family, or any human being that I come in contact with, in case I'm not here tomorrow to reflect and say I'm sorry. But on a positive note, the song also reminds me that yesterday is gone and it is Day one of the rest of my life so I can determine to make a new start and turn the tide of my life with God's help, so I can be a blessing to those around me and sow to the Spirit so I can reap goodness and blessings in my life and bring glory to Him who saved me. Glory to my Lord Jesus Christ who shed His blood upon the cross and conquered death so we could have eternal life and be cleansed by His blood of all our sins. This gift He offers to all who call upon His name.",1464825600,5

76989,10607,2908,"Over two years after Robin Gibb passed away, his last solo album is released with some songs nearly ten years old. These were written between the years of 2004-2008 with the hope of using some as part of a Bee Gees reunion with Barry. That was not to be.

The listener does get treated to an array of some of Robin Gibb's best music to date. It's much more upbeat in style and verse than previous Gibb compositions and the result is wonderful. Relying mostly on electronic equipment, it's tough to tell that most of the instruments are electronic. Robin's voice is more reedy than usual with a higher pitch, but that only tends to pulls the listener in closer. This is Robin Gibb at his most vulnerable and intimate self.

With a hefty dose of seventeen songs, Robin Gibb concentrates on layered songs backed with a strong beats. In fact, only two songs, 'Solid' and 'All We Have Is Now' are the only slower ballads and they stand up to any previous Gibb tearjerker. One of the standout cuts that are worthy of single treatment are 'Alan Freeman Days' with its excitable exclamatory proclamations. 'I Am The World' is a remix of the 1966 B-Side vocal and it's a layered composition that stands up to modern tastes and styles. 'Broken Wings' contains a danceable beat that begs for an extended version, if not a single release. The instrumental sections and backing vocals are synthesized genius. 'Avalanche', a title taken from a 1970 song is an anthemic upbeat journey of a song with powerful backing vocals.

'Mother Of Love' is presented in its original form and is a nice respite from the bevy of strong songs, but what it lacks in structure, it makes up in pure emotion. 'Don't Cry Alone' is a wonderful reminder of Robin and RJ Gibb's classical hybrid, Titanic Requiem'. The closing cut, 'Sydney' is one of the saddest songs I think I've heard any Gibb brother sing. Reportedly recorded on an iPad with sparse working, the lyrics and the yearning vocal tug at your heart when you realize what Robin is singing about - a loss of innocence and younger times. It's the perfect finish for this album.

With a nice cardboard sleeve and notes from his wife Dwina, this makes for a fan special. Note that the Isle Of Man Post Office is releasing a limited edition of this album (1,000 copies) with an accompanying DVD. Robin Gibb deserves this and more. Thank you Robin.",1464825600,5

77008,128,17630,"Juice Crew all-star and former Cold Chillin' roster-man Craig G (Craig Curry), now a well respected veteran of hip-hop and the emcee culture, has absolutely nothing to prove nor anything lacking in his current plans, coming live from Queensbridge, New York City again with I Rap and Go Home, his sixth album (humorously but pointedly titled), released June 3rd on Soulspazm Records. The '80s-made rap-natural hasn't sacrificed his ability at writing and spitting authentic rhymes and lines, knowing full well that there are plenty of other artists in the game specializing in separate areas. He crafts his verses with an original likeness, sustaining the art the way it was first made and designed. With age and confidence, this man puts his mind-frame on full display for us, in brilliant rap-poetics, with friends and homestyle sounds, assuming good ole NYC is one of those nice homesteads for hip-hop, which it still is.

Quite the elder statesman of the game Craig G is indeed here, stating who he is right off the bat and doing him and his thing in ""Intro,"" discussing the history of hip-hop music and sharing his love for the culture in ""Long Time"" and flaunting his healthy agreeable seniority and authority with old school friend Kool Keith in ""Make Your Arrangements."" Those are the first three cuts, but one song removed, in ""It's My Turn,"" he looks after hip-hop like a good guardian, a solid sentinel with strong lyrics there and everywhere else before and thereafter of course. As a matter of fact, Craig G is not just a good rapper; he is a perfect rhyme technician of the trade, steady but sure, and nowhere is this more demonstrative than in his lovey ""Don't Stop Loving Me"" joint, where his vocals come together like two peas in a pod.

There are not many other concepts than the aforementioned, save for G's story of a trip to Japan for some shows in ""W.F.W.T.,"" his love for the nighttime in ""N.I.O.M.M."" and his clear real reveal of sellout artists giving themselves away to mismanaging labels in ""This Man (That Ain't Cool)."" The floor of I Rap and Go Home is covered with gorgeous, irresistible boom-bap beats, adorned with several tantalizing flourishes and loops, most especially the glorious rustic fiddle in ""This Man."" Thank god for great golden age guys like Craig G, especially when they come back and make strong albums like this one. Also, shouts to Keith, Buckshot, Ras Kass, Rockness Monstah, Jarobi and Canibus for busting it out the park. I Rap and Go Home is nicely controversial in one or two traditional modes, but the opinions are still relevant (who can argue with putting slackened artists in their place or domineering with flawless mic-skills after all?), but there are arguably too few risks and they're familiar and relatively safe. Still, at the end of the day, Craig G has never been known as an offensive, polarizing loudmouth in rap. He's just doing the great things he does here with no fancy unnecessary frills, keeping to the basics, with very positive results.",1464912000,4

Its as if hes forgotten how to make good songs, let alone more classics.

Hes still one of my favorite songers, but Id rather him retire than tarnish his legacy any further. Wristband is conceptually akin to The Afterlife from his last album and just as silly. Street Angel brings some interesting hip-hop effects, but structurally the song is a mess. The Werewolf is a grower, but In A Parade never stops sounding stupid. Two short interludes on an album barely over a half-hour long reek of laziness.

He sings of words and melody, but its the latter thats the problem. Paul Simon is still a wordsmith. Its the way he sings those words that, more than anything else, make his new songs mundane. The Capeman mustve robbed him. I can almost count on one hand the good songs hes released since then. Cool Papa Bell is one of them, yes, but good songs on a Paul Simon album are supposed to be the rule, not the exception.

77021,56,3429,"There is absolutely no question that with R&B singers, they have been more lagged at the soul, than really feel more authentic from the heart. It has been the case with too many crooners today. But when Marvin Gaye was around, he sincerely showed his soul so uniquely in a place and time where his sensuality in song at hand and voice. Sadly though, it has been over thirty years since he was violently murdered by his own father. But honestly, his work has been bigger than life today, even though he is not here anymore. His last major hit, Marvin's only big hit when he left Motown for CBS Records, Sexual Hearing is one of those tracks that still delivers from the swooning of the seductive soul. It is one of those songs that continues to show why Midnight Soul has a very deep place in so many hearts. It is a song that really is worth its money every time you listen to it. If you had never heard a Marvin Gaye song before, well this song is one that I recommend that you do go to from start to finish. It might've been Marvin Gaye's last big hit, but it is still sexual at the soul.

77028,4505,17635,"Without looking closely I didn't realize that these weren't all the original recordings or the original artists. I just saw the song titles, knew the classics, and gave the playlist a shot. I was taken a back a little bit when Summer of 69 started and I didn't hear Bryan Adams. But the Strumbellas version was pretty good. (It's not the original, but it's pretty good) So I kept listening.

I didn't recognize all of the songs on this list by name, so some of them might be originals but I don't know and I'm too lazy to research them all.

Most of this is pretty good. There are some exceptions. Here's a few examples of the good and bad.

The stuff that stood out positively for me.....

 Brandi Carlie's version of God Only Knows really worked. I mean I really liked this version. It's very different from the original, but awesome. Its more muted in tone.

 Passenger's version of Sittin' On The Dock Of The Bay had a big uphill climb to be worthy of my ears compared to the original. It found a way. I'd still prefer Oris Redding, given the choice. But Passenger does it justice.

 I liked Beats Antique's version of Cruel Summer better than the original. (Sue me. I like what I like.)

 Lolo's way of doing The Boys of Summer was cool. It took me a while to like it, as initially it didn't hook me. But I kept listening and it pulled me in. Again, Don Henley's version is better. After the Ataris screws this song up I've been wary of further covers. But Lolo made it their own instead of just trying to make an exact duplicate like the aforementioned band.

 Fort Frances gave Summer In The City an entirely new sound and feel. I liked it!

 The Wild Reeds gave us a version of Surfer Girl that sounds exactly like it would have in the 60's if the Beach Boys had been The Beach Girls. It's cool.

On the other hand....

 Eric Hutchinson's version of Don't Worry Be Happy didn't impress. It's hard to cover an absolute iconic song like that.

 The Districts version of Nightswimming isn't going to win any awards either. They took a great REM song and made it sound like a monotoned barbershop quartet.

 Teddy Thompson and Kelly Jones redid Walking On Sunshine. It's not bad by any quantitative measure. But it lacks the heart and soul that Katrina And The Waves gave it.

That's just a few examples. The set list is still a good summer playlist overall.",1464912000,4

77034,14708,17628,"Ladies and gentlemen, here is another piece of evidence supporting the decision to award Paul Simon the Library Of Congress' Gershwin Prize for popular music. This album is a strong, vital piece or work. And like other albums in Simon's long and storied career it will offer multiple delights to those who actively immerse themselves into listening to it, hearing it multiple times. And then there are those who will dismiss is as more ""I-miss-the-old-stuff"" music. I feel sorry for them. This is a fine, melodic album featuring unusual and varied instrumentation and musical styles. More important perhaps is the fact that Simon's delicate, immediately recognizable quicksilver voice is in good shape. Hang in there while I try to place this in brief context.

The critical accolades that greeted the release of So Beautiful Or So What seems to have re-energized this brilliant, somewhat melancholic composer. At the ripe age of 74, Simon has produced another album that defies expectations and pushes the boundaries of his compositional style. A composer who values the role that rhythm plays in song (""these are the roots of rhythm, and the roots of rhythm remain"") Simon has hired Italian dance club king Club! Club! to re-invigorate his approach of infusing his music with the rhythms of exotic instruments. (Like So Beautiful, this album is an aural wonder through a good pair of cans).

The rhythms themselves surround and envelop some wonderfully acerbic lyrics (the obit lyric quoted above is preceded by the lines: ""Milwaukee man led a fairly decent life/made a fairly decent living, had a fairly decent wife. She killed him - sushi knife./Now they're shopping for a fairly decent afterlife. The werewolf is coming."" Ah - The Afterlife. ""You got to fill out a form first/And then you wait in the line.""

Like The Afterlife, it's easy to get caught up in the rhythms and not immerse yourself too deeply in the song itself. That would be a grave mistake - no pun intended. Just as The Afterlife dealt with the composer's imagined death, songs like ""/In A Parade"" are not what they seem to be upon initial hearing. In the case of the latter, the parade refers an ER tech (nurse? physician?) delaying with an endless stream of patients with critical needs (""Some nights the ER is quiet as an EKG/But tonight it feels like every broken bone, tonight it feels like every wounded soul is filling out a form or on the phone./I can't talk now, I'm in a parade.) The song itself reflects Simon's desire to return to Mardi Gras; it's rhythmic foundation sounds as if he recruited every Mardi Gras Indian Chief to pound out the soul of New Orleans.

And therein lays another level of genius in the music and the songs, of Paul Simon. They can be heard and appreciated on so many different levels - but they are typically not obtuse (i.e., Dylan) or treacly (i.e., McCartney) or musical re-treads (i.e, Taylor) as is the work of many of his contemporaries. Paul Simon continues to break new musical ground.

I'm still absorbing this muic myself, and hope to add more detail to this review as I do so. I find it ludicrous to compare this album to earlier work, just as I find it ludicrous to compare it to Simon's alleged masterpiece Graceland, certainly his most important album. But at this early point, I think I would compare Stranger To Stranger to one of Simon's most under-rated albums, and one I would consider to be among his greatest works: Surprise. Each is an album that defies expectations. Each is an album that confounds some, while revealing great mysteries and connections with repeated listening over time. And each one is a statement of a true artist - a true genius if you'll allow me that - working at the peak of his creative powers at that particular moment of time in his life.

If this is the level of creativity and vitality associated with being 70+ years old, it isn't ""terribly strange"" at all. At a stage in life when artists can rest on their laurels and release albums of ""so what"", Simon has pushed himself to create another album that is ""so beautiful"" rather than ""so what"". Stranger To Stranger is so fresh, and full with the joy of discovery that it gives me something to look forward to as I move through the sixth decade of my own life. Well, unless the Werewolf becomes our next President and the riots of those without wristbands becomes prescient rather than merely clever.

Finally, let me echo the sentiments of those who recommend purchase of this ""deluxe"" edition, particularly for the live performance of Duncan from Prairie Home Companion which is absolutely exquisite, and dare I say superior to the original. In this recording the pan-pipes in the refrain are replaced by two fiddles, which give the song an ageless Stephen-Fosteresque quality. Not only is this in keeping with its recording as part of PHC, but also elevates the stature of the song to that of a truly timeless classic.

I feel fortunate to have grown older along with Paul Simon. He continues to provide meaningful entertainment. And inspiration.",1464912000,5

77039,1665,17628,"I'm pleased to say that this is a good album. I have been very fortunate to have had access to an advance copy and I've listened to this a lot over the last few days; it's varied, unexpected in places and contains some very good tracks.

Paul Simon has always been a very fine musician who has developed and experimented throughout his career. He once, for example, set himself the challenge of using every note of the chromatic scale in a single song: the result was Still Crazy After All These Years, which is a magnificently beautiful song and a true classic. Not all his challenges have been met so successfully and I'm not sure that there's anything of quite that stature here, but this is a fine album nonetheless.

Simon incorporates all sorts of styles including rap, jazz and many others. Several tracks are very rhythm-driven (like Wristband and The Werewolf), but beautiful melodies are still in evidence in the title track and Proof Of Love, which I think is a truly lovely song. The album is very varied in instrumentation, feel and style and I'm delighted to see Simon still stretching the boundaries in his seventies  but this is still recognisable a Paul Simon album and collection of really good songs. His voice is still in good shape and he's a real master at putting a song across.

Simon's lyrics have always been outstandingly good, and they are as sharp as ever here. There is a good deal of rage against social injustice as well as profound expressions of personal emotion. Take this, from the Werewolf, for example:

""The fact is most obits are mixed reviews
Life is a lottery, a lot of people lose
And the winners, the grinners with money-coloured eyes
Eat all the nuggets, then they order extra fries

Ignorance and arrogance, a national debate
Put the fight in Vegas, that's a billion dollar gate
Revenues, pay per views, it should be pretty healthy
The usual deductions, and it all goes to the wealthy""

Strong stuff  and it's good to see that real social bite still remains in at least one veteran songwriter.

I've loved Paul Simon's music since Kathy's Song was among the first songs I learned to play and sing, almost half a century ago. He hasn't always hit the spot with every album, but this is a really good one and I like it a lot. I don't know whether everyone will agree  I have always thought Hearts and Bones was quite brilliant, but it wasn't one of Simon's biggest hit albums, for example  but I think there's real quality here, and I would recommend it warmly.

[By the way, the Deluxe Version contains ""bonus material"" which is actually well worth having, including a fine live rendition of Duncan and the excellent title track from Dion's (also good) recent album New York Is My Home, which Dion and Simon sang together. It's not always worth getting the Deluxe Version of albums, but I'd recommend this one.]",1464912000,5
77040,12631,17628,"Over this past weekend I had the opportunity to sample a pretty good chunk of Paul Simons stunning new release Stranger to Stranger on NPRs First Listen website.  As usual, listening to a Paul Simon album proved to be an exciting and mostly joyful experience.  Simon always succeeds in delivering the unexpected as he experiments with an eclectic variety of sounds, genres and instruments. I liked a tune called Wristband right off the bat and was not surprised to learn that it has been chosen as the first single to be released from the album.  One has to marvel how at the age of 74 Simon is not content to rest on his laurels but rather seeks to synthesize seemingly disparate musical forms into highly enjoyable new tunes.  There are a generous 16 tracks on this album and you cannot help but be impressed by the quality of each and every one of these songs.  I especially enjoyed Pauls moving musical tribute to Negro League baseball legend Cool Papa Bell as well as a neat number called The Riverbank.  The disc closes with the very fine duet New York Is My Home featuring fellow New Yorker and rock and roll Hall of Famer Dion.  A very nice touch indeed!

After listening to Stranger to Stranger a couple of times it becomes abundantly clear that time has not eroded Paul Simons musical prowess one little bit.  This is an outstanding recording from start to finish and there is little doubt in my mind that it will be another huge success.  While it might not be quite on the level of his masterpiece Graceland this is nonetheless an album that deserves your attention and support.  After all, there are not that many new releases for us aging baby boomers to glom on to these days.  Highly recommended!",1464912000,5

Thankfully, with ""Tired of Tomorrow"", they still managed to find the niche to write fuzzy, distorted pop songs with overwhelming guitar sounds and plenty of hooks to warrant repeat listens. It seems that this carries an even more nostalgic sentiment this time, with melodies that draw parallels to the likes of Smashing Pumpkins, Hum and early Starflyer 59. While I can't quite debate on whether this is as good as before (or even better, don't take the rating TOO close to heart now), I'm completely satisfied and impressed with where this band is going, and can only expect them to build upon their loud, dreamy sound even further down the road.",1464912000,4

77060,1180,17645,"I've been a fan of Ladyhawke since I got her self-titled debut album in 2009.  She was part of the 80s synth/retro pop revival that I got into in 2008.  Several good albums came out in 2007-2013.  For an 80s music & synth pop fan, it was wonderful to hear so many great songs coming out.  A lot of it wasn't mainstream, especially in the US.  I'm not embarrassed that I love 80s music, synthesizers, and yes 80s guitars and rock music.

Ladyhawke's debut is still one of my favorites from that era.  I bought it on vinyl and purchased the standard and deluxe CDs.  I still listen to it sometimes.  It's a great throwback to the 80s.  When she released her sophomore album, Anxiety, I was excited and ordered 2 copies of the CD as well as a different version from the UK (sadly, it had no bonus tracks).  The album was a conscious choice on her part to change her sound to less 80s and less synth and more 90s with fuzzy guitars.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed with that album.  While it has some great songs on it like ""Girl Like Me"" and ""Cellophane"", which I still love, as a whole album it didn't hold up well in the long run, with some depressing themes and lackluster music, and I have rarely listened to it in the past few years.  I like some 90s music, and the album was good for a while, but it kind of lost it's power after a while, while the debut still retains its own.

So, I learned my lesson and was cautious this time with the third album and pre-ordered just one copy, on CD.  No vinyl or different versions or anything.  I wasn't too excited hearing the first two singles, ""A Love Song"" and ""Let It Roll"".  But I had hopes for it because she adopted a more pop sound.  After listening to the entire album a couple of times this morning, I really like it and I love that she has embraced the synth pop sound again.  It's a happier sounding album than Anxiety, sunny and bright in most spots and good for summer listening.  Even the artwork is much better with bright colors.  It isn't as retro as the debut, but it's very good and along the same kind of sound as that one.  It is actually kind of a mix of the sounds of both of her first two albums, but without the fuzzy 90s guitars.

 1.  A Love Song-Sets the tone of the album as being a pop album with synth and definitely different from Anxiety.  There are pretty much no fuzzy guitars to be found on this album.  I like the message of this song but it feels like something is missing.  Not sure what.  It's a good opening track, but for some reason it hasn't totally grabbed me.  It has grown on me since I first heard it, though.  Nice pop song.  4/5
 2.  The River-I like this one a lot.  Very catchy and upbeat.  It has some good hooks.  Nice summer song.  It will be good to listen to on a drive or a walk in nice weather.  Or even while swimming in the pool.  5/5
 3.  Wild Things-Starts out sounding a little sad, like organ music, but turns into a lovely mid-tempo song with nice synths.  Great title track for the album.  This sounds like a continuation in sound from the debut-it could fit in with those songs very well.  Love the synths.  5/5
 4.  Let It Roll-Another upbeat song.  Catchy, but it is more in sound with the Anxiety album.  It sounds like that style a lot.  Fits with those tracks, so if you enjoy that album you might like this song.  No 90s guitars, though!  It's synth but has the vibe of her last album.  4/5
 5.  Chills-Another catchy, upbeat song.  It reminds me of another song I've heard but I can't remember which.  It's another song about love, a noticeable theme here.  It gets a little repetitive lyrically at times, but the music is great.  5/5
 6.  Sweet Fascination-I love this one!  One of my favorites.  The synths are front and center, which I love.  The opening is very 80s-esque.  And the first line is about writing letters, another possible reference to an activity from a byone era for most people.  Yes it could mean writing letters online...but I'm thinking of handwritten ones.  I loved writing letters in the 80s and 90s.  So I choose to think of it that way.  But yeah, this song rocks!  Check it out.  5/5
 7.  Golden Girl-An interesting little pop song with some guitar, and synth.  Catchy, and some of the sound effects in it remind me of vintage video games like Atari and Nintendo.  She talks about the good old days in the song, and even the title reminds one of the popular Golden Girls tv show.  So, this song reminds me of the 80s in several ways.  I have to give it a 5/5 for these reasons.  5/5
 8.  Hillside Avenue-Opens with, yes, synths again.  Reminiscent of Depeche Mode a bit in the opening.  I like this one.  It turns into a bit of a dancey sounding song, retro and also modern.  Which is what most of the album sounds like.  I like when music has a classic or retro sound while also being new and fresh.  5/5
 9.  Money To Burn-The album's only true mis-step for me.  It isn't a bad song, but it's kind of boring.  I don't care for the lyrics, and musically it is very similar to the Anxiety album style.  Sounds like a leftover from that album and the guitars were replaced with synthesizers.  One I will likely skip often.  3/5
10.  Wonderland-The album picks up again and comes back with a bang.  This is a great song.  Very catchy and memorable.  I'm glad it was placed near the end of the album, because I don't like when albums are full of good songs at the beginning and get weaker or boring in the second half or end.  This is the strongest of the last few songs of the album.  I love the little guitar break near the end.  5/5
11. Dangerous-Catchy but a little bit of a darker song, interesting to close the album with this song.  It's another track similar to Anxiety's style.  I'd have loved it if there was one more song similar to ""Crazy World"" or ""Cellophane"" to close out this album.  (Those weren't album closers, but near the end).  But, I'm sure some fans will love this song.  4/5

Generally speaking, this album is a lot brighter and more cheerful than her Anxiety album.  I feel like she probably wanted to change things up or was pressured to.  I have no idea why she embraced the synth sound again when she seemed so excited to abandon it in 2011.  Maybe Anxiety didn't do as well as she wanted, or maybe she missed the more pop sound.  I don't know, but I'm glad she changed back!  This album isn't as great as the debut but it's close.  Definitely a winner, and much much better than Anxiety as far as being more upbeat, fun to listen to, and repeat listenings will go.  If you were disappointed with Anxiety try this one!  It's more like the debut.  It sounds retro but modern.  If you're into that, give it a try.  So glad she's back and in more pop mode.

I give it 4 1/2 stars-5 stars.  My favorite songs:  The River, Wild Things, Sweet Fascination, Chills, Hillside Avenue, Wonderland.  Ranking her albums so far:  1.  Ladyhawke Debut  2.  Wild Things.  3.  Anxiety.  If anything could've made the album better, I'd say a little bit more guitar similar to those in ""Crazy World"" from the debut, in a couple of songs in addition to the synth here would've been cool.",1464912000,5

After 2009's Blacksummers' Night album, many welcomes his soulful voice and swooning heart brilliantly. Nevertheless, many have welcomed him back and awaited to see what he would sincerely conjure up with next, as he promised to make a trio of albums. Well, now with his similar titled album blackSummers' Night coming out soon, many in soul and R&B have waited for him to swoon all over again. His returning single is absolutely no exception that he has not lost what he had shown musically for years. Lake By The Ocean is a more upbeat and soulful song that still brought out the best of his voice and charming sophistication in music. Maxwell delivers a lot of heart into his work nicely, and this song flows well with a lot of the songs he had released for the past several years like Fistful Of Tears and Pretty Wings. It is a very upbeat song that takes your breath away. I recommend this song for any die hard Maxwell fan, and a nice listen to for any die hard fan of neo-soul and R&B.

When Jay Black joined Jay and the Americans in 1963 he persuaded the group to rework the song and include it in their ""live"" performances.  Finally in the spring of 1965 United Artists records agreed to have the guys record it and to release it as a single.  And as they say the rest is history.  The song reached number 4 on the Billboard pop chart.  Last time I checked Jay Black (now in his mid 70's) was still performing this song in concert and still manages to hit many of those high notes.

You!"" and ""Ride Out""). I've never been a great fan of the praise and worship genre but Bryan makes me a fan with this smooth, uptempo song of ""spiritual"" overflow. The backing choir - Roderick Giles & Grace - really provide awesome background vocals on the song. The instrumentation has a drive and energy that pushes the song to another level while Bryan gives it a very passionate vocal workout during the last two minutes of the song. This is a great song for church prais teams to perform and it's also cool for those who just want to have a private but riveting worship time with God.",1464998400,5

77176,10119,17310,"Destruction - Under Attack (2016)
Rating: 4.2 / 5

It's a shame that we as thrash fans often get distracted by overly obsessing and criticizing the big four for the quality, or lack thereof, of their most recent offerings, when there are some outstanding ""true"" thrash albums being delivered by the so-called second tier bands. While both Megadeth and Slayer may have just put out their best albums since the early to mid 90s, bands like Destruction have been putting out consistent neck snapping material since the band's 2000 reunion album ""All Hell Breaks Loose.""

Now I'll be the first to admit that just because a album is heavy, that in itself doesn't automatically qualify it as good. A few of the albums that Destruction has released since ""All Hell Breaks Loose"" have been somewhat spotty, which brings us to the album in question, 2016's ""Under Attack."" With ""Under Attack,"" Destruction seems to have recaptured the same thrashing spirit that made their 80's material so noteworthy. While the material is mostly straight forward in delivery, there is still some nice, and somewhat flashy guitar work by guitarist Mike Sifringer. Song after song, ""Under Attack"" leaves albums like Slayer's ""Repentless"" sounding weak and vulnerable. From the riffing to Schmier's distinctive snarl, ""Under Attack"" sounds like vintage Destruction. Sonically, this album is clean and easy to decipher, all the tones seem to be exactly where they need to be.

If I did have to pick out one minor gripe with this album, it would have to be the backing vocals. I am not a big fan with the way the backing vocals are layered and mixed, there is something about the way they rest in the mix that makes them sound sloppy.

Overall, ""Under Attack"" is a great thrash album, and while there may be a few bumps in the road along the way, the final destination is quite rewarding.

A musician must live in a habitat thats special and desired until theres an end, so sounds follow with his or her pursuits.  Its true that instruments play in part because of Earths weather, although Id have to consider musicians with their daily routines as well as their vacations.  Musicians rest and play so well, since goals are a matter of proclamations and livelihood, and slogans can be collections of memes like Walk Of Life that contain pressure from so many artist feelings.  While its true that a feeling can be a bad association of ideas, thinking is not everything.  Dire Straits vague perceptions are interesting and stimulate our imagination about beats in relation to cultural clues over golden oldies and turning all the night time into the day.  Im not sure if all the keys can be revolved around a single layer of music as they can several layers of music; the song itself is an interpretation of decades of music, so sounds themselves can become great memes if they're continuously passed down by musicians and listeners.  Walk Of Life is open for interpretation because the 20th century of music was lived for by millions of musicians and listeners, and thus art is more like a proclamation of life rather than its exact description.  If some Amazon reviewers give this song four stars and think that two and two make four, Id tell them that mathematics is collections of memes like songs and that cultures just have to begin somewhere.  Just Dire Straits place in history can be like time itself, and the layers of music from Walk Of Life nourish out of their creative nature to shake up the boundless definitions of music until our ears drip with the healthy, vivid tunes.  The songs layers of music are definitely not built up like a planet so much as a dream, and they're constantly serving up Dire Straits cognizance of music society when they're refining the beats to suit their individual perfection of song estimates.  A singers woo is an abstraction of typical animal roars, so memes about dedication and devotion can be special abstractions rather than just mere acceptances.  Due to this observation, poetry must be at least one abstraction.  Mark Knopfler really digs Johnny!  Its probably confusing to talk about feelings apart from descriptions for the same reason that a musician is often feeling after given descriptions.  Walk Of Life is designed with magnificent echoes, at least metaphorically, and the vague sound levels ramp up on the songs own composition as though they slightly stick to hard substances such as the loudest voices and the gluey arrangement of cultural memes.  Of course, listeners can stipulate what kind of progress lives with a song if they actually describe in their heads the emotions possible and impossible before going on to feel it.  Dire Straits is a present of golden thunder which rocks the sparks after settling down slightly with the peaceful storms, and Walk Of Life is a popular example of theories in practice from creativity.",1464998400,5

77273,56,17667,"There has not been a whole lot of music that David Crosby had put out on his own after abruptly leaving Crosby, Stills & Nash, but also a lot of it also had to do with his years with drug and alcohol addiction in the 70's all the way to the late 80's. But his heart was getting back out there in the late 80's and early 90's after years of strife and heartbreak, which also lead to him later on dealing with liver failure. But out of all of David Crosby's own songs on his own, he had very few good ones that reached out to everyone. But that actually was the case with Hero, which Phil Collins wrote for himself, but eventually gave to David Crosby for David's album Thousand Roads. The song is very good, and hits the soul nobly well from someone who had been in Folk music. David does show he had worn his heart on his sleeve, even when a generation that was more interested in acts like Nirvana and Mariah Carey didn't want to hear a old soul like David Crosby. I sincerely recommend you download this song, and give this a chance from David. The hero did go free, and is everlasting on one song.

Great beat! An anthem that everyone who knows God comes to realize...

In our pursuit of happiness, we end up discovering ""There ain't no life worth doing what I did to You!"" and our deep need for forgiveness...
The happiness comes in knowing that He gives forgiveness freely and shows us the fulfillment of a real ""pursuit of Happiness""

Americans will especially relate to this as we understand the ""inalienable right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness...""
and where it has lead many of us...

Happily, I have experienced & been able to give the true measure of love:
""Some times you leave the one's you love, but if it's love they won't give up, 'cause they know war's raging...""

""I've been working all night, can't You help me to believe...This song ain't nothing, the song can't set you free!""
Many of us have literally worked ALL NIGHT in our pursuit & understand that songs of joy will only take us so far, we to know the One who gives perseverance & endurance (Romans 15:5)

77295,56,7353,"There is honestly a difference between a song that is a waste of time, and a song that can be everlasting from the soul. Stevie Wonder has honestly been one of those very few entertainers that has not only made excellent songs over the years, but he has shown joy and delight from every corner of the world with his gifts in song. Hard to believe that it has been over fifty years since he started his career, and his songs have never gotten tired. They have always been just as blossoming and beautiful as they were released years ago. One of my favorite songs, Overjoyed, originally released back in 1985 from his In Square Circle album, is just as sincere and absolutely beautiful as the day that it had came out. It is truthfully a noble work of art that keeps of aging strongly like a fine glass of wine. It really is one of my favorite songs of his, just as strongly as I Just Called To Say I Love You and Isn't She Lovely. If you really had never heard a Stevie Wonder song before, well I absolutely recommend you hear his love from the heart.

Dimensions of Horror is the old school Death metal album you want and crave.  Truthfully the band is just taking the early Death sound and creating new riffage in that same flavor.  You'll hear traces of classic Scream Bloody Gore tracks like ""Zombie Ritual"", ""Mutilation"", ""Denial of Life"", and ""Evil Dead"" permeate different songs.  The production is vintage and warm sounding where you basically can turn it up as loud as you want and the sound is just as fluid and crisp.  The vocals are gruffer and scarier than Savage land and the lyrics are a step up.  I'm not sure why they decided to release an e.p. when two extra songs would've necessitated it being an l.p.

77335,7871,17684,"This album was recorded at a time when country music was struggling to make sense of new sounds, even disco, the phenomenal crossover success of people like Dolly Parton, Kenny Rogers, and urban cowboy types was happening  Johnny Cash by this time had settled into a nostalgic mood and his concerts were pure ""entertainment"" for better or worse. You can tell by the out-of-character synthesizer that cuts through a few of the songs hear that it was only partially successful from an artistic standpoint.  It would take a while before Johnny Cash would get a ""second wind"" of inspiration and even relevance, but that doesn't discount that these are good songs and great performances. Just don't expect them to be the barn-burners of the Folsom or San Quentin records. Quite simply, this sounds similar to Elvis in the 70s, a ""greatest hits"" jukebox performer going through the motions, but it is still cool to hear it.

Interestingly, this album made me wonder just how many live Johnny Cash concerts are out there in the vaults, just sitting around gathering dust, there could be some really incredible stuff if only we could hear it.  If something as interesting yet limited as this could be released, I can only imagine the good things that we're not hearing.",1465084800,3

Sometimes I don't think people understand just how much God loves us.  Well to make a long story short, I heard this song at one of my church's worship services.  it was something about this song that opened up the heavens for me and I just couldn't stop thinking about it.  I've heard it before in times past.  However, with a deeper study of the word of God, the song came alive with a new meaning to me.  It is definitely a holy song taken from the word of God and is an ultimate worship song.  So let us join in with the angels and sing the Revelation Song, you'll fall in love with it and of course God himself.",1465171200,5

77506,14182,13489,Good.,1465171200,4
77507,12176,17639,"Starting to love this album, it's really starting to grow on me the more I listen to it. But I do miss the heaviest of past albums like Guitar Gangsters and Cadillac Blood, Rock the rebel/ metal the devil, and the Strenght/the sound/ the songs. But like any awesome band they new to grow with each release. They has starting to change with each release starting with Beyond hell/ above heaven and continue with Outlaw gentlemen shady ladies which I think this album sounds a lot like. The album starts off with the catchy single The Devils Bleeding Crown. Sounding like a really catchy Metallica song from load or reload with a more modern sound and Glen Danzig singing over it with more melody. Some of the rhythms almost sound like Cape Of our Hero from their previous album. The second track Marie Laveau rocks a little harder but doesn't turn into a full on thrash metal tune like you would expect. All the songs sort have the same vibe and rhythm. Most of the album just reminds a lot of Outlaw Gentlemen and Shady Ladies. Like these songs could almost be outtakes or b-sides from that album that's how similar they sound to that album. All the songs have sort of a 90s era Metallica vibe about them. Like a mixture of the Black album, Load and Reload mixed the Misfits and a dash of southern rock. Probably the heaviest song on the album is the last song track 13 The Loa's Crossroad. A sort of medium paced thrasher with a bagpipe solo in the middle. Volbeat on this release do two covers one of a band I've never heard of called Rebound by a band called Teenage Bottle Rocket. The second cover they do a song called Battleship by the Geogria Satellites. A guest appearance by Danko Jones on the song Black Rose. But all in all this is a solid album. Volbeat seem to inject more melody into their brand of Rockabilly heavy metal that seems to really work. Maybe the only downfall on this album is it sounds to similar to Outlaw Gentlemen and Shady Ladies. Maybe not for the die hard metal heads that prefer their old stuff. But I enjoyed it all the same banjo and bagpipe solos in all.",1465171200,4
77508,9460,15267,was not that thrilled with it after listening to it.....,1465171200,3
77509,3666,17639,"Volbeat's sound is very recognizable, now more than ever thanks to heavy rotation on the radio. Songs like ""Heaven nor Hell"" and ""Lola Montez"" catapulted this group to mainstream status in a major way. However, they also seem to have resulted in less heavy riffs and more towards melodic hard rock. Outlaw Gentlemen and Shady Ladies was where this transformation really got started, even though the group has always had its share of melodic hard rock. There were generally more heavy riffs. Outlaws Gentlemen had some good riffs on tracks like ""Dead But Rising"", ""The Hangman's Body Count"", and ""Doc Holiday"", but in general was pretty much melodic hard rock. This album follows that trend, but even further in my opinion. Tracks such as ""The Devils Bleading Crown"" and ""The Loa's Crossroad""  bookend the disc on somewhat heavy notes, but everything in between is catchy melodic hard rock. Sadly this group is falling into Nickelback status with how formulated their albums are becoming. Their one saving grace is they aren't doing cheesy love songs. The riffs and vocals though are becoming too similar with each disc. I understand the ""if it's not broken, don't fix it"" mentality. It's worked for many mainstream bands, but it does wear thin on those who would like a bit more creativity. Not talking about reinvention or anything, because that often leads to even more backlash, but something to mix things up a bit would be nice in the furture.",1465171200,3

77526,56,14387,"If there is honestly one thing that I do love about Adele, is that out of all the female singers out there like Rihanna or Beyonce' Knowles, Adele is one of the very few songstresses that isn't severely overexposed, and not annoying. In fact, she has shown for the past several years that when she does come out with new music, it explodes when it comes out. Not only are the songs good, like Rolling In The Deep or Hello, but they are worth listening to over and over again, because she isn't a product for her own voice, she is a real songstress at heart. Her latest single from 25, Send My Love (To Your New Lover) is actually a very upbeat song and sincerely soulful from the heart. I like the song a lot, and it really is just as rhythmic as what Lorde had a few years ago with Royals. It really is a good song that really is a departure from her earlier songs like Set Fire To The Rain, and shows her in a more upbeat rhythm, but it does not weigh Adele's voice down. In fact, it really is worth listening to. If you love Adele, than this song is worth downloading.

77540,12615,16650,"Perhaps the best Metal Church album since The Human Factor, though I haven't heard every release with Ronny Munroe.  I think Mike Howe sounds pretty darn good on this album.  I wish the song writing was a bit better, but it's pretty typical of Kurt Vanderhoof.  I wish Rick Van Zant added more harder burning lead guitar, the guitars overall are merely okay.  I realize Metal Church have pretty much always been on the cusp of the Thrash Metal/Heavy Metal, so don't expect this album to be particularly heavy or fast.  While this record could have used a bit more variation, it's very solid and would slot in nicely between The Human Factor and Hanging in the Balance even though Mike Howe is the only returning member from that era.",1465171200,3

And they are all very good.  Although she doesn't do other artist's covers like Jolene well.  But she writes most of her own songs anyway.  And I have wished she would do a cd of songs she's written that were hits by artists like I'm That Kind A Girl, Hey Cinderella. Strawberry Wine. Wrong Side Of Memphis,  Stuff like that.  This cd does have You And Tequila.  It and Your Husband Is Cheating On Us and South Of Heaven are Highlights.  Also this has nothing to do with the cd.  but I got this idea when the song You and Tequila was out.  I am a big Dallas Cowboy fan.  But not a fan of Tony Romo.

77617,12631,2769,"Like Little Willie John and Jesse Belvin before him Billy Stewart remains a largely unknown and vastly underrated figure in the history of R&B. Billy Stewart was discovered by the legendary Bo Diddley who was so impressed by his ability to play the piano that he asked Billy to join his band back in 1956. Diddley even got Stewart a recording contract with his record label Chess in the late 1950s.  Nothing much came of it for a couple of years but beginning in 1962 he made several outstanding and really unique records. Most oldies fans will probably recall a couple of Billy's earliest hits including ""I Do Love You"" and the magnificent ""Sitting In the Park"" from the golden year 1964. But Billy wanted to appeal to a wider audience and was willing to take chances to achieve that goal. In 1966 he recorded the LP ""Billy Stewart Teaches Old Standards New Tricks"". The first single released from that album was Billy's rollicking interpretation of the George Gershwin classic ""Summertime"".  I think Ol' George would have approved. That tune would go on to become one of the surprise hits of 1966. Billys amazing vocal performance on this record will simply blow you away!",1465257600,5

77626,13819,13202,"I have to give credit to Taylor Swift. She writes (or co-writes) mainly good lyrics. Her albums have become way too commercial and overproduced. I want her to grow up to be like Stevie Knicks, but we have 20 years to find out if she will mature musically, or take the money and retire young.

In the meantime, we have what is probably the most artistic recording from this era of Taylor's life. And it was not recorded by her.

I don't care what Ryan Adams' intentions were. It could be a joke. He might hate Swift. He might be trying to impress her. Or her young fans (ew). He might be showing his fans that he really is okay doing covers now (ever since he gave into covering Bryan Adams's Summer of 69).

Here's what makes his cover album great: he channels Bruce Springsteen (think Nebraska and Born In The USA). His version of Shake It Off sounds like I'm on Fire. On Style, he takes what could be the best track on Taylor's album, and turns into a sultry number with some smooth role reversals. And on All You Had To Do Was Stay, he knocks one out of the park, making it more listenable and catchy than Taylor's original version. His Out Of Woods is haunting. Wildest Dreams matches his alt-country style quite well. On This Love, which should have been the final song on Swift's album (it certainly sounds like a closer), he does a good job keeping it quiet and intimate at a piano. And he sincerely tries on the unsalvageable Welcome To New York.

Along with Doveman's cover of the Footloose soundtrack, Ryan Adams' 1989 is a surprising little gift from the music gods. Why did Swift authorize this? Did anyone know her fans would buy it in droves? And like it? Who cares. It happened. Thank goodness.",1465257600,4

77655,12631,3137,What made growing up in the 1960's so darn cool was the incredible variety of musical genres that were represented on Top 40 radio. I have been hooked on this music all of my life and have never been able to let go. In 1966 the Brazilian pianist and bandleader Sergio Mendes chalked up a huge hit with a remake of a song Dusty Springfield had made popular just a year earlier. In my opinion this tune sounds every bit as fresh today as it did when it was recorded nearly half a century ago.  This is the original recording you would remember from the radio.,1465257600,4

77679,14794,17639,"So...like many other Volbeat fans, I awaited the release of this album with great anticipation. The first early release track ""The Devil's Bleeding Crown"" was a good track...not their greatest work...but good. The next early release track ""The Bliss"" is a bit on the easier side. I felt like this track would easily be the ""Lola Montez"" of this new album. It's an OK song but I'm a fan of the heavier Volbeat songs as well as the rockabilly inspired pieces. Seal the Deal followed as the third early release track and again...it's OK and left me wondering what was going to happen with the rest of the album because so far I was not liking the trend. When the rest of the album dropped last week I immediately listened to it from beginning to end like I do all of my new releases. However, unlike every other Volbeat release which all commanded a second and third (and many more) beginning-to-end listening streak...after the first listen I was pretty much done with Seal the Deal. I read an interview before the album release where Michael Poulson stated this was going to be more of a rock album and would not feature the varied stylings previous albums were known for.
While it is true this is a rock album...Seal the Deal leaves so much to be desired. As a diehard fan I have to admit I'm a fan of almost everything Volbeat does...except this album. I really feel like this album is to Volbeat what ""Load"" was to Metallica. It feels very commercial and very ""accessible"" to a mainstream audience but not to the fans of what Volbeat is truly capable of. This is not coming from a place of hatred for the album or the band when I tell you that many of the songs sound the same and are very difficult to tell from one another. Even my wife, who is not a big metal listener (but is a huge Volbeat fan) is very disappointed with this album.
I don't understand this change of direction at a time when this band is becoming so huge and popular and that popularity is based on what this band has done with their previous five releases.
Give the samples a listen and decide for yourself. But for me this album will not be on my Volbeat playlist.",1465257600,3

77690,2664,17730,"Debut album from this duo of Les Claypool (Primus) and Sean Lennon (The Ghost of a Saber Tooth Tiger), who create trippy pop/rock with a cosmic psychedelic playfulness.  Mellotrons and guitars sprinkle your ears with sparkling rainbow splatters of freaky-fun sounds riding on the  hallucinatory bass-thump of spotted unicorns in a twisted Disneyland.  Occasional flirtations with spastic noise and experimental ambience add a peculiar mystery to the mix.  Shades of 60s baroque folk and prog-pop rise up through the prismatic pastiche with fog-like, wispy, ghost-dancing images of Syd Barrett, the Beatles and Bubble Puppy.  On tour, the band is augmented by members from the Beastie Boys & the Fungi Band.  Monolith of Phobos is a creative bit of psych/pop fun with a cool nostalgic edge, a strange and rewarding listen.",1465257600,4

For the price you get a lot of music - 200 songs. There is a wide assortment of styles in the collection, but they are all fairly innocuous and unobtrusive - which I guess is why they are given the label 'Lounge Music'. That not to say they are bad, just a bit bland/generic - like eating vanilla ice cream. These tracks are much better than say typical elevator music. I like listening to them on shuffle as background music while I'm doing other stuff, and with the number of tracks you get - you can go awhile without having one repeat.",1465257600,5

Yes, and how many ears must one man have before he can hear people cry?  Dylans associations with mankind are fine because he stays loose and plays with syntax to get insight whether he uses plain English or not, so the intrinsic behaviors to his godly motives are fascinating if also miraculous of intellect as well as rarity.  Utter honesty is his best defense when visions are as light as air, contemplating here about the evolution of deaths even if my prosperity can never be considered the obvious return from my oral literacy or one special type of speech impediment.  Dylans accuracy of life portrayal isn't sketchy but quite a definitive reference to wisdom and proclamations which become ironic for possible answers thatd be too long.  The catch phrase Blowin in the Wind for me implies mystery of wisdom since torrents of weather really haunt peaceful armies before spelling out an unknown danger, being itself a collection of memes that form the real word in a society of slippery doves and washed mountains.  My favoritism of folk music is too my actualization of materialism with secondhand spirits during this sleepy discovery of rounds with musical notes, turning my exhausted body into a medium of reception in the causing sunshine near those musical videogame consoles.  Dylans courage is really his fear, very much in tune with his awkwardness of bravery at a moment here and there, performing with twisty physics; I can say more about this, and Dylans determination isn't usually his regret throughout song playing but promises in emotional terms.  His childish strength is his romantic reign of the songs pieces of advice relating to Earths likely devastations, so Dylans imbecility is cute yet truly serves as a warning symbol for doubt exaggeration.  Blowin in the Wind is a romantic chant because Dylan juggles ideas with infatuated meanings rather than observing an obvious thesis, and by getting to basic predictions he turns out to be a very unlikely hero.  Dylan can inscribe lyrics under purple light due to his abstractions with easygoing agony as well as vague demands, and he cuts a statement to the bone, living through reactions toward ordinary nature in his interesting admiration of defense.  Maybe rapid feedback from reviewers gets customers going, but I like to treat our reading as a chance for meditation instead of fashionable conversation attributed to busy people.  In fact, fashionable conversation attributed to busy people is a source of aliteracy.  By my phrase admiration of defense, Im describing what romance is in poetry.  Indeed, with answers blowing in the clouds around the bends of Dylans proclamations over historic references, I believe we need to be more confused about our learned behaviors since our knowledge of love may occasionally be a precipice to the darkness.  Yes, and how many times must a man look up before he can see the sky?

77821,18,16789,"I recently saw Charles Bradley in concert for the first time (more on that later). Bradley is known as having the uncanny ability to personify, if not channel, the James Brown spirit, while at the same time having a wonderful R&B voice. This is Bradley's 3rd album.

""Changes"" (11 tracks; 40 min.) opens with a quick and gospel-tinged ""God Bless America"", only to then dive straight into ""Good To Be Back Home"". The song is drenched in retro-soul just like Sharon Jones brings her stuff (they are both on the same music label, Daptone). The songs are quite focused and to the point (most of them are in the 3 to 4 min. range). Some of the album's highlights for me include the pensive ""Ain't Gonna Give It Up"", ""Crazy For Your Love"", and ""You Think I Don't Know (But I Know)"", but the reality is that there really are no weak songs on here, and the album makes for a very consistent, and coherent, listening experience.

This past weekend I saw Charles Bradley and his band, the aptly named Extraordinaires, in concert at the rapidly growing Bunbury Music Festival here in Cincinnati. They played an early evening set on the main stage that brimmed with energy. The set list was divided pretty evenly between this new album and the ""No Time For Dreaming"" album. If you haven't seen Bradley performing live yet, you haven't experienced the full Bradley experience, not by a long shot! The man is absolutely amazing. The massive crowd absolutely loved it. If you have a chance to see Bradley live, do not miss him! Meanwhile, ""Changes"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1465257600,4

77847,12631,102,"He was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1987 and is widely considered to be among the greatest soul singers of all-time. Jackie Wilson began his career as a solo artist when in 1953 he was offered an opportunity to replace Clyde McPhatter in the legendary R&B group Billy Ward and His Dominoes. Jackie made several memorable sides with the group before signing with Brunswick in 1957. Once again flying solo, Jackie Wilson would record dozens of hit records over the next decade. Of all of those terrific recordings my favorite has always been the remarkable ""To Be Loved"" from 1958. Feel the sheer exhilaration of a person who firmly believes that someone actually loves him. I have always felt that this was his finest vocal performance as a solo artist. This is the original hit recording you would remember from the radio.",1465344000,5

77859,1484,17749,"All the hype about this album from Jim saying this is going to be a straight up classic metal album is right, however it's not what I was hoping for. One thing Breuer said was something along the lines of he wanted it to feel like a real rock CD, not just a novelty, but after listening a couple of times, I can't help but think it's all it really turned out to be.

It's a mixture of hard rock sounds, mostly 80's, where things either sound like Metallica or another 80's band influenced, as well as a little bit of AC/DC. Sure when I heard Brian Johnson was going to guest vocal on a track, I was stoked and couldn't wait to hear it, after all we should all be familiar by now with Hokey Pokey by now, and maybe even when Jim and Brian preformed it together one night. I was almost devastated as I heard acoustic guitars and what seemed like a ballad about to start up with Brian Johnson talking over it, and then the track ended. I almost cried thinking ""Don't tell me thats it?"" but luckily the next track ""Mr Rock N Roll"" kicked in and Brian does great singing it with J.B. However, even tho I can say it's the strongest track on this entire album... in fact, it's the only memorable one if you ask me, I have already made my own edited down version that cuts out a weak bridge that I thought slowed down the song, and would work well had it been a late 80's Alice Cooper track, but on here with Brian, it seemed enough out of place that I edited it right out of the song, so I can't give it the perfect score.

As for the rest of the album... I suppose if you can't get enough of that 80's metal sound, then you may love this... but I was not hearing great riffs, and it was clouded in a theme that this was being sung by a guy who escapes his family life and records his music in a garage... which is what this album was going for, but in the end, it felt like a common theme where each song was ""My family stresses me out and I escape to the garage to rock out"" which is ok, but it's not the greatest theme an album could go for, and I found myself rolling my eyes at some songs.

Overall, I'm sorry to say, it does come off sounding like a novelty album. I'd compare it to John Valby's CD ""Valby Rocks"" where its filled with a bunch of generic sounding rock songs that don't bore you, but don't grab you either. Apart from Mr Rock N Roll, I doubht i'd wanna hear anything off this album anytime soon, or care to see JB preform anything else from this album live. It really did come off as a novelty nostalgia album to 80's metal music. Which is not something i'm against, don't get me wrong... but it could have been much much better. Perhaps if Jim asked more of his rock star friends to help out with guest vocals, it might have made a bigger impact than what it ended up being.",1465344000,2

77872,14818,17437,"I don't care what anyone says - this album is near perfect, and it was totally slept on when released, granted the release didn't give many people in the US a chance to hear it, so this isn't totally surprising.

What we have here is a lush throwback album that shows our hero pursuing a new sound while simultaneously bringing back some familiar favorites. It's all here - the drum loops, the strange lyrics, that irresistible groove and now some strange synth that sounds dated and futuristic all at the same time.

Initially this album got solid reviews from some but in more recent years it's been all but slept on by fans and reviewers. This likely is just because no one really got to hear it in the states - it was distributed in some UK newspapers and was never even sold in retail outlets in the states. In fact, this Amazon listing has only sprung up now in the event of P's death. I bought my copy on eBay last December after hearing about half the album on youtube back in 2011. I knew I wanted it for a long time but never thought to check eBay. Nabbed it for $5 at the time, and I'm not surprised that scalpers are moving in on this one too. I hate that about it - but I was lucky to finish my collection of his entire official discography about a month before he passed (got a load of unofficial stuff too haha you know with P you just have to seek it all out).

Anyway, if you get a chance to get this disc for not too much definitely pick it up. If you like Prince and you have an open mind I can't imagine anyone not liking it. It's so addictive to me that I've had it on repeat for several weeks at a time when listening to it. Then again I've been listening to Prince almost exclusively since I bought this album last December when I finished the collection. At this point ""Princing"" is a verb and I'd like to think I don't have a problem, but I probably do. Then again, I'm cool with it and don't even care.

Prince, we miss you, we love you, and we'll see you when we're welcomed to the dawn.

Cheers!",1465344000,5

77881,2607,17754,"There is a great new concert album, Cosmic Connections Live, that has been released by Deva Premal & Miten, one of the top acts in the world when it comes to combining Western sounds with Eastern music, and bringing mantras into the modern-day world for everyone to enjoy.  The album starts with some of their best-known material -- classic mantras sung by Deva with Miten helping out, and in one case major audience participation.  Then the spotlight switches to a couple of folk-pop songs written and sung by Miten (formerly a hot rock act himself in England).  And the album ends with a strong bonus studio tune that is mostly instrumental.

So there is a lot to enjoy on Cosmic Connections Live including gorgeous bansuri flute playing by Manose from Nepal (a tiny country between India and China).  There also are special guests here and there helping out on vocals, piano, violin, tabla and percussion.

This is simply an absolutely stunning recording start to finish with great singing and musicianship, peaceful and soul-stirring mantra singing-chanting on about half the CD, and heartfelt English lyrics on several numbers.  This music can serve as a great spiritual, meditational or yoga experience, but it also works perfectly as pure entertainment, a sit-down-and-listen-to-it album.",1465344000,5

77890,18,17756,"I recently saw The Dear Hunter in concert for the first time (more on that later). I admit that I am a newcomer to this party. As much as I listen to music and like to discover new bands and keeping in mind these guys have been around for years, I somehow never found out about these guys until now. Better late than never I suppose.

""Act IV: Rebirth In Reprise"" (15 tracks; 74 min.) would be a double album back in the vinyl era. The album opens with ""Rebirth"" and that song sets the tone for what becomes quickly apparent, namely that this is an incredibly lush and warm album. I have not yet listened to the Act I, II and III albums, but imagine that Act IV is the continuation of some grand story (even though apparently there is a significant time gap of a number of years between the release of Act III and this one). I am trying to come up with a comparison as to other similar-sounding bands, and while I certainly hear elements that remind me of Queen and Genesis, it also reminded me at times of Rufus Wainwright, of all people. In all, a great, wonderful album, and not for anyone in a rush.

Last weekend I saw The Dear Hunter in concert at the rapidly growing Bunbury Music Festival here in Cincinnati. The Dear Hunter played a mid-afternoon set before a massive crowd at the River Stage, an amphitheater-like setting where the crowd looks out onto the Ohio river and into Northern Kentucky, just a gorgeous setting. Front man Casey Crescenzo was in great form, and the band's set was absolutely riveting and one of the big discoveries of the festival for me. Can't wait to explore more music from these guys. Meanwhile, ""Act IV: Rebirth In Reprise"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1465344000,4

77892,7245,17628,"Being one of probably a ""handful"" (relative to the vast sky full of boomers, some of whom may have joined me back then) of Simon devotees who started collecting his music (with and without Art) beginning with Wednesday Morning 3 AM, I have a different take on his releases than most.  I've literally grown up with the man, his music playing in my ear nearly as much as the Beatles who I literally grew up with also.  Paul S and Paul M have been with me all my life.  I am crazy enough to have purchased The Paul Simon Collection simply so I could have a CD copy of Slip Sliding Away which was NOT released as a bonus track on any of the remasters.  Columbia, you tick me off.  STRANGER TO STRANGER fits my modus operandi when it comes to describing the releases of Paul Simon.  Each and every album release is better than the last and yet I do have my favorites.  But the long and short answer, musically, is that Paul Simon strives each and every time to raise the bar on himself and without fail, he succeeds each and every time.

Yes there are evidently a small few ""disappointed"" fans for whom this one didn't do it.  I feel differently but that does not assuage the fact that they (and you) might be disappointed.  However, critically, one has to acknowledge that this master of composition is astoundingly creative and each effort masters a new score.  Some folks felt that One Trick Pony and Hearts & Bones were slippages.  For me they were stepping stones from Still Crazy to Graceland, and both of them were steps up on the rungs of his musical genius.  ROS was another quantum leap above Graceland.  And since the turn of the millennium, the man just keeps amping up the dial on his creatometer!  Surprise and Beautiful were monumental for me.  He never loses what he accomplished before, it is all there in the notes and if you look carefully in the small corners of his compositions.  There are hints of Hearts & Bones, Graceland, Rhythm Of The Saints, You're The One, Surprise, So Beautiful, even Still Crazy and There Goes... all over these songs, and yet they are simply beautiful and new and fresh and heartfelt.

Paul's tribute to Harry Partch fits in perfectly with what he himself has accomplished as a composer, and this experiment with new tonalities and sounds just becomes organic in the hands of Paul Simon.  Lyrically, there is an arc of aging which is readily apparent in the last 4 albums, songs where he sardonically and humorously self-deprecates himself as if preparing for ""the afterlife"" in a mirthful Judeo-Christian way.  STRANGER TO STRANGER continues this mother lode and the title of the album itself becomes double entendre as both a tip of the hat to Partch and a nod to himself in that his music continues to evolve into stanger and stanger embryos.  Personally I love it.  Paul Simon never sits still on top of an art form, it is in a constant state of flux and mutation.  Again, this album is organically perfect in the caravan which Paul debarked upon in 1963, his travels taking us on a mythic journey of sonic development that is full of beauty, grace, profundity, and curiousity.  I hope the majority of Simon fans will find this another treasure trove, as I have.  Sometimes you have to give his music a few more than one or two listens before it grabs hold, but once it does, your hooked.

The sounds on this album are subtly (not hugely) different, you will hear things that sound familiar but are craftily engaging and auraly honed on an almost imperceptible scale.  This was the beauty of Partch's instrumental inventions.  Like oriental and Indian music, the tones and scales are measurably different but they invoke a dreamy substance that is at once enjoyable and influential.  What you end up with is a Paul Simon album that sounds astral, current, pleasurable, and even instructive.  If he stops here, he will have donated as much as any other artist in music history if not a vast treasures worth more.  Hopefully Paul has more to give us in the future, but this album alone is worth every penny and listening effort for any fan of sonic creations.  Oh and the ""deluxe"" version is well worth the extra $ as there is no ""filler"" here, just wonderful tunes to love and enjoy, especially his performance of Duncan (from his first post-S&G solo album) on The Prairie Home Companion radio show, simply stupefying, and a great duet by two founders of Boomer Era music, Paul and Dion musing about their NYC.

Enjoy the music friends!",1465344000,5

77909,3315,17628,"I picked this up at Barnes & Noble this morning, and I'm only halfway through it as I start writing this, but STRANGER TO STRANGER could be Paul Simon's best album in about 30 years, since GRACELAND. The richness of ideas and melodies is all there, along with a dazzling array of sounds and influences -- I wouldn't wish Paul Simon to have any history other than the one he has, but I have to say that in another era, he could have been a very imposing classical music figure, right up there with the likes of Vaughan Williams, Holst, Hindemith, Ives, Antheil et al. And he's lost none of his gift for basic songwriting, either, as ""Proof of Love"" demonstrates; by itself, it's worth the price of the album.

In short, the artist and his fans can relax -- he's still got it, and how!",1465344000,5

77938,4745,17519,"This is another absolutely don't miss it bargain box from Bach Guild.  I've been scooping most of these up as they've appeared over the past few years but I have to say that I think the three Big Chamber Music Boxes are in many ways the picks of the litter.  By purchasing all three you get almost 24 hours of chamber music, much of it in excellent performances, for under $3.00.

Volume 3 has an emphasis on Haydn and Mozart, with some Boccherini, Beethoven, Rossini and Schubert thrown in.  The two Boccherini Quintets alone are certainly worth the price of admission.  As for Mozart, there's a nice selection of string quintets, a couple string quartets and two piano quartets, as well as the ""Gran"" Partita for Winds (K. 361) and a few other pieces.  Haydn is represented by several string quartets.

The question I know you're asking is ""What did they mess up this time?"", since it seems that almost every BG Big Box has at least one blooper.  In this case the Mozart Oboe Quartet is the unhappy victim.  What is labeled as the 2nd movement is, instead the first movement of somebody's string quartet.  I'm leaning towards Haydn but has anyone identified it?  What is listed as the 3rd movement of the Oboe Quartet is, in fact, the 2nd movement and the real 3rd movement is nowhere to be found.

But with some tracks that I had heard from This Is What The Truth Feels Like, I wasn't completely impressed with the songs that she had already came out with the album. Misery, the third single from her album, isn't actually a strong and poppy song that really drove in the way that she had from her earlier solo songs like The Sweet Escape and Rich Girl. It is a alright song, but not anything that really drive into a bigger sound for Gwen. Hopefully, there are better songs from her down the road that are worth the while. Something will put us with her misery into a more upbeat song.

He hasn't strayed from the style of his first release as these tunes are slow grooves with hints of backbeats from older songs. You'll definitely recognize the beat mix on these as compared to his hit single ""Prayer in C Minor"". Again, if you want really upbeat dance songs, you'll need to hit the web for remixes. As is, it makes a nice background chill playlist to pair with say Kygo or something.",1465430400,4

77969,4745,17170,"I think the three Bach Guild Chamber Music Boxes may be their greatest bargains and I think Volume II is perhaps the best of the lot.  If Volume 1 has a lot of basic repertoire (chamber music-wise), Volume II focuses on works you probably haven't heard.

There is a really nice variety and a number of welcome rarities.  I'd never encountered Dohnanyi's chamber music before, nor had I heard the Arensky 2nd Quartet or the Clarinet Quintet of Samuel Coleridge-Taylor.  This set also contains excellent performance of the Debussy and Ravel String Quartets and several French pieces for winds.

So a lot of music (outside of the Debussy and Ravel) that may be unfamiliar but very worthy of your time and 99 cents!",1465430400,5

77983,1108,9789,"You know you're a book nerd when you download this song not because you were a Bruce Springsteen fan in your youth, but because the song's lyrics are a recurring theme in the Koushun Takami novel ""Battle Royale"" (a fantastic book, by the way).  That book got me curious about the song itself, and so I gave it a listen... and ended up enjoying it enough to go ahead and purchase it on Amazon.  If it takes a Japanese thriller novel to get me into an American rock icon, well, there are stranger ways to be introduced to a new favorite song, right?

""Born To Run"" is a lively and upbeat song, not afraid to pour on the sound yet still staying musical -- sometimes a band sacrifices good instrumentation in favor of noise, but this song stays on key and great to listen to.  Bruce's voice isn't what I'd call excellent, but it has a worn and gravely edge that grows on you as you listen.  And his lyrics, though occasionally grim (""suicide machines?""), stay hopeful and expectant, looking towards a bright future despite hard circumstances.

I can appreciate why Springsteen is such a well-loved musician, and though this is the only song of his that I listen to regularly, it's fantastic and makes me want to check out the rest of his work.  Thanks, ""Battle Royale...""",1465430400,5

78011,4745,16904,"What turned out to be Volume I of a series (3 so far) of chamber music boxes from the Bach Guild concentrates on the Romantics and late 19th Century nationalists.  We have Schubert, Brahms (the 3 Piano Quartets), Dvorak, Borodin & Bruckner, the last represented by his rarely heard String Quintet.

Some of the Schubert (e.g., ""Death & the Maiden"") are the same performances that were issued in the Schubert Box several years ago but I find the Schubert String Quintet here, as performed by the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, markedly superior to the one in the Big Schubert Box which, in any event, now costs $9.49, not 99 cents.  Similarly, the Brahms Piano Quartets were also included in the Big Brahms Box of 2012.  Still, when there's this much music of this quality, I don't mind a few duplications.

Between the three chamber Big Boxes and some of the composer specific boxes, we have a pretty good survey of chamber music from Haydn to Berg but there are still some gaps.  Where are the Brahms String Quartets, or quartets by Mendelssohn, anything by Franck or Faure, or the Schumann Piano Quartet or Piano Quintet.  How about it, Bach Guild?",1465430400,5

78031,10506,17771,"By the early 1970s the Philly Sound of Gamble & Huff had eclipsed Motown as the most successful R&B hit-making machine in the music biz and The Three Degrees were like The Supremes of the whole enterprise. Although they had been together for a decade before this album was released, 1974 was THE year the Three Degrees really made their mark. Not only did they have a US Top 5 and UK #1 hit with the beautiful, wistful WHEN WILL I SEE YOU AGAIN, but they also sang a small part at the end of the funky Billboard #1 instrumental hit by MFSB called TSOP (The Sound of Philadelphia) which is included here as a welcome bonus track.

For those new to the group, this is as good a place to start as any. I have purchased five of their albums on CD recently and this one definitely ranks as one of their best. That unmistakable Gamble & Huff sound is all over it. The vocals are smooth and velvety, so don't expect a 1970s girl group that is as spirited as the Pointer Sisters or gritty as Labelle. The arrangements are full and rich and complex even on the ballads with ear-catching tempo changes and unique structures that make the album a very interesting and satisfying listen. On CANT YOU SEE WHAT YOURE DOING TO ME the gals punctuate each delivery of the line with a strong Bay-Bee that really makes the song.  A WOMAN NEEDS A GOOD MAN glides back and forth from classy to sassy with a hi-hat that picks up steam on the bridges only to pull back and slow down for the next versebrilliant! The throbbing DIRTY OL MAN was a big UK hit but didn't catch on in North America; perhaps radio programmers thought the title was too risqu? Who knowsall I know is its catchy as heck. The epic IF AND WHEN outclasses even WHEN WILL I SEE YOU AGAIN as the most gorgeous cut on the album, but it was probably too big and grand for radio airplay when picking the singles.

Id give this album FIVE STARS except a few numbers here sound a little too much like commercial jingles: I LIKE BEING A WOMAN and YEAR OF DECISION and bonus track LOVE IS THE MESSAGE, otherwise Id rank this as one of their essential albums along with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/New-Dimensions/dp/B003UN58WY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">New Dimensions</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/3d-Three-D/dp/B004IOP1JO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">3d (Three D)</a>&nbsp;which were both produced by Giorgio Moroder.",1465430400,4

78073,396,17778,"If you're reading this chances are you already own the original 2 CD set compiled from these 1973 gigs.  So any lengthy review isn't needed for this new additional set of music.  If you like the tunes found on the original set (which are different from the versions on this new set) you'll find even more to like across these three discs and the DVD.

Suffice to say these performances (with a few songs appearing more than once) are superb--Morrison and his hot band are on cracking form.  Morrison knew how to sing a lyric--his tone, his inflection, the small spaces he leaves between words or phrases--all accent his emotional range over these songs.  And listen to the bass/drums foundation that seamlessly propel this  music.  The strings rounding off some of the sharper edges.  The horns when they get pumping.  And that piano!  Like many of you I also ordered Vol. 1 because the sound (using the original tapes) has been improved for that 'you are there'  feel.  The DVD is an equal visual treasure of Morrison on stage during this period.  And speaking of Vol. 1--the new set is a tri-fold cardboard package with a pocket for each disc.  There's a few color  photos of Morrison (mostly) and the band on stage.  And again there's no booklet.

In a nutshell--this may be the best (and best recorded) example of live Van Morrison and his Caledonia Soul Orchestra with few (if any) less impressive moments.  When people talk about Morrison as  a performer this set (and Vol. 1) is all the proof needed.  And if for some reason this era of Morrison's music is new to you--buy with complete confidence.  The packaging is a five panel fold-out  cardboard style for the discs, with snap-in trays (with photos underneath)  for each disc, with a  panel with a  pocket for the 10 page booklet that has a two paragraph explanation of the music, track list for each disc, a list of band members, and a few photographs.  Personally I was hoping for a more in-depth look at the music with an essay putting these gigs (and Morrison) into some kind of perspective.

Then they lay down a vocal track on top of that that's just brilliant at times. I really enjoyed this, and this isn't even typically my style of music.

I don't think this is for everyone. I think there are people who are going to honestly hate this. But I encourage everyone to at least try it even if its not your typical cup of tea. It might just hook you.

Take it From Me opens the album in a way that literally forces you to get up and move. I defy you to sit still when this is playing. It's just energizing. It makes you want to get up and accomplish something.

The World Would Run Better particularly stood out to me too. It's got a great sound and brilliant lyrics. Like really brilliant lyrics that highlight the insanity of individuals thinking the world should run the way they feel it should, and how that simply doesn't work on a planet with 7 billion individual opinions.

Autocorrect is another song that really stands out as lyrical brilliance. On the surface it's all about having your brain physically plugged into the internet. On a deeper level it's got some pretty serious philosophy going on. And it's all set to some great energetic music.

Where I Belong was the only track that didn't thrill me. It was the music. Somehow the band wasn't hitting it's stride with the sound they made.

Again, I don't think everyone is going to like this. But I think everyone should try it out. As musicians these guys are amazing.",1465516800,5

78083,12631,227,"""That girl took that song away from me."" It was the summer of 1967. Otis Redding was in the midst of the performance of his life at the Monterey International Pop Festival. What he was referring to of course was the way Aretha Franklin had turned his song ""Respect"" into one of the biggest hits of the year. His version topped out at #35 on the pop charts a couple of years earlier. But I digress. Otis Redding was just beginning to hit his stride as summer turned to autumn in 1967. This veteran performer had been around for a while. The fact is that up until this point he had made the Billboard Hot 100 a total of 19 times although his records usually ran out of gas somewhere in the middle of the chart. His tunes fared much better on the Soul/R&B charts where 8 of them had made it into the Top Ten. It is really difficult to understand why the man had not had greater commercial success up until this point. After taking a few months off Otis Redding returned to the studio in early December 1967. There he recorded a song he had co-written with Steve Cropper. Everyone thought it was a mistake. His wife hated it. Three days later Otis Redding was dead at 26, a victim of a tragic plane crash in Wisconsin.

When the story appeared in the newspaper I remember thinking to myself ""Who is that?"" And although I had been collecting records for about three years I had never heard of him. Despite his enormous talent Otis Redding had just not quite connected with general audiences. Less than two months later in January of 1968, Volt records released that tune his wife and friends hated so much. ""(Sitting On) The Dock of the Bay"" went all the way to #1 on the Pop charts and remained there for a month. Everyone now finally realized just how talented this man had been.  An American classic.",1465516800,5

It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version.

78121,56,17783,"This past year we have already lost a lot of legends in music whom have died before their time and fell to the waste side before our eyes, from Prince to David Bowie and Maurice White of Earth, Wind & Fire. This year has honestly been a tragic year for legends. But some of them have had so much to celebrate over the years, like this year for Phil Collins, whom had stepped away from the music industry for quite awhile to take care of some health problems. Well, now he is making a return to the industry, and celebrating his music all over. But anyway, he also celebrated some huge milestones this year, celebrating the 35th anniversary of his solo debut Face Value, and the 30th anniversary of him winning Album Of The Year at The Grammy awards for his No Jacket Required album. But when he was going to re-release all of his studio albums again, he had a lot of albums being celebrated, but was taking a step back on one album, and changing it to a different record.

The Essential Going Back, is more like a recreation of his 2010 album Going Back, where Phil Collins recorded a lot of classic standards and covers of songs he had grown up listening to, and celebrated the music of soul in the 60's and 50's. But fort this re-release of the original 2010 Going Back album, which had two versions, Phil decided instead to reduce the tracks being re-released instead of releasing all the tracks from both of his 2010 versions. Still, you do get some really good tracks being remastered like (Love Is Like A) Heatwave, his rendition of Stevie Wonder's Uptight, his soulful rendition of Some Of Your Lovin' and a driven rendition of The Temptations standard Papa Was A Rolling Stone. There also are some live songs which were never released as original recordings on the studio album a soulful cover of The Temptations hit My Girl and Too Many Fish In The Sea. Yet, the downside to this release for die hard Phil Collins fans whom have bought the earlier versions of Going Back released in 2010 is that there were a lot of good songs that were cut out of the re-release like In My Lonely Room, a soulful cover of Standing In The Shadows Of Love and Jimmy Mack to name a few songs.

Still, despite a few songs being overlooked, which Phil Collins intentionally said he would do, because he felt the deluxe version and even the original version would be a little too much of a hassle being re-released as a album, The Essential Going Back is a good buy for mainly the die hard Phil Collins fans where the live tracks are worth the while, but for newcomers to Phil Collins music, they might want to take the step back and listen to the original album versions, regular and deluxe from 2010 to get a better ear of what Phil had made musically from his soul first, before they sink their teeth into The Essential Going Back. Still, it is a good buy for hard core Phil Collins fans that is nobly worth the dollar.

78122,2402,17778,"It's Too Late to Stop Now released in 1974 was a double 12-vinyl album showcasing the best moments distilled from three live performances on Van's 1973 world tour with his Caledonian Soul Orchestra: at The Troubadour in LA, the Santa Monica Civic and the great Rainbow Theatre in Finsbury Park, London. To many people ITLtSN was the greatest live-performance album of all time, by any artist.

Now after 42 years, we finally get volumes 2, 3 & 4 plus a 50-minute DVD of the performance at The Rainbow (and how young, lean and 1970s they all look!). All this material is previously unreleased and to the same high standard as that on Vol 1, mastered from the original 2-inch analog tapes and mixed with great skill by Guy Massey. Why it has taken over 40 years for this fabulous music to be released is almost beyond belief.

Van and his CSO band had soul, and they rock. The presence of brass and strings in the line-up endows the music with a depth and subtlety rare in live rock/jazz from the period, or indeed any period. The overall soundscape is redolent of Vans 1968 masterpiece Astral Weeks.

The DVD of the Rainbow concerts on 23 & 24 July 1973 is particularly enjoyable, with this superb band pulling out all the stops and delivering an epic performance including Brown Eyed Girl, Moondance and Cypress Avenue. Van is on top form and in fine voice centre-stage, and we also see the rest of the CSO ensemble. NB the third audio CD in the collection also features different material from these Rainbow concerts, but the very best is on the DVD.

Van has had a long and illustrious career as composer/performer spanning many genres and has played with many bands, but this 1973 epoch was possibly his finest hour. That it has taken so long for this treasure to be released is a crime against music, but at last we have it. Enjoy.",1465516800,5

78128,14845,17785,"Paul McCartney is no judge of his own music. The greatest flaw in his albums is that he doesn't edit himself well. That flaw is apparent in this collection. There are some songs here that aren't that great. I'm giving it 3 stars because of the many great songs, but it's not a genuinely great McCartney compilation, too many missing  songs for a 4 or 5 star review. A missed opportunity.",1465516800,3
78129,14846,17785,"Following on from 'Wings Greatest', 'All The Best' and 'Wingspan', this is McCartney's fourth collection. You might ask whether there is a need for yet another 'best of' CD but there hasn't been such a release for 15 years, and he has released a lot of songs in those subsequent years, so yes, there probably is. Selected by Paul (and would anyone really expect him to leave it to anyone else?), this isn't a complete hits package; it adds a lot of album tracks to give an overview of his solo career. Fortunately, he's had the sense not to make it a chronological compilation.

The 67 tracks spread over four CDs, and housed in a hardback style book with plenty of nice photos, are an excellent representative of his vast body of work since 1970 (there's also a 39 song double CD available). Whatever songs are included, there will always be those who ask why so-and-so is missing and why is that on there but you're never more than a few minutes away from the next hit single.  However, not all of his LPs are represented. There's nothing here from 'Run Devil Run' or 'Driving Rain'. 'Flowers In The Dirt' isn't represented either. Surprisingly, he's seen fit to include 'Sing The Changes' from his alter ego The Fireman, but was sensible enough not to use anything from his more avant garde and experimental output.

The sequencing is quite effective. 'Live And Let Die' precedes the quaint 'English Tea' and the once banned 'Hi Hi Hi' is followed by the ballad that is 'Waterfalls'. It saves you from getting into familiar territory of hearing a bunch of fast tracks before a selection of slower ones. It makes for a nice mix of styles. Whilst McCartney is a master at knocking out simple, catchy tunes ('Heart Of The Country'), there a few things on here I don't care for ('Silly Love Songs' anyone?) but those songs are far outweighed by the good and very good tracks.

For McCartney diehards, this isn't an essential purchase, as you'll have everything here, but there is another group who may have only a couple of his albums or none at all and they're the ones at which this is aimed. This gives you all the big selling singles and a disparate selection of other tracks as a taster to further investigate his solo career. Clocking in at just shy of 4:20:00, this is decent value for money.",1465516800,4

The lyrics are nothing that I'd call poetry in motion. But the vocal track sounds good.

If you are throwing a party and played this loud, you'd be happy. It's going to keep people moving around dancing a little. ""Roll Up"" (Track 4) in particular almost forces you to dance as you listen. And their opening track 'HandClap"" keeps repeating lyrics about how they can make you clap by clapping in the song....and yeah....darned if they didn't.

There is a lot of filler on this album that just passes by me. No catchy beats or choruses that get you hooked in and singing along like songs off their last album.

I recently saw Big Grams in concert (more on that later). Let me state upfront that I've been a fan of Phantogram since the early hour, and when I heard that they were doing a collaboration album with Outcast's Big Boi, I couldn't help but be surprised a bit. But with 20/20 hindsight, it all made sense of course. It's hard to believe that this (mini-)album came out last September, it seems like it was yesterday...

""Bog Grams"" (7 tracks; 27 min.) opens with ""Run For Your Life"", and it's probably my least favorite track on here. Not enough melodic hooks for my liking. That gets corrected right away with ""Lights On"", in which Phantogram's Sarah Barthel sings lead and which really sounds like a Phantogram track for the most part. ""Fell In the Sun"" feels like the first TRUE collaboration as Big Boi and Berthel trade verse and chorus. ""Put It On Her"" is an up-tempo track in which all three (Big Boi, Josh Carter and Barthel) trade verses, and the lyrics of which will make you likely blush. ""Goldmine Junkie"" is the only non-dance oriented track on here. The release concludes with ""Drum Machine"", another highlight. In all, this is a nice release (not sure one can really call it an ""album"", at just 27 min.--couldn't they really not come up with even just one more song?).

Last weekend I had the good fortune of catching Big Grams in concert at the rapidly growing Bunbury Music Festival here in Cincinnati. Due to a thunderstorm passing through, their 7 pm set start was delayed half an hour, and just as they finally hit the stage, the sun came back out. ""Thank you for bringing the sun back just for us!"" Sarah screamed, to the delight of the massive crowd. Big Grams live plays as a four-some, but let's be real, all the attention goes to Sarah and Big Boi. They put on a boisterous set, played mostly from the album but also a couple of covers, including Outcast's ""Ms. Jackson"", again to the crowd's delight. Big Grams' set was the best of the entire festival for me, period. Just fun from start to finish. If you have a chance to see them in concert, do not miss them!",1465516800,4

And now that we have it, it gives us all the opportunity to talk about our disappointment in it, for isn't that what we all do now? But Im not going to do that. (At least not right now.) I am just going to talk about how much there is to enjoy about this set, and why I purchased it, despite owning 95% of it already in original, as well as archive editions. And the reason is that its Paul McCartney. Pure and simple. What follows is a bit of a lengthy essay to put this release from this artist who straddles the centuries  into context. Please click on ""read more"" to read the complete review! But the bottom line is: If you're a fan, strongly consider it. If you're a casual listener, don't hesitate. Eight bucks a disc for 16 songs on each disc in the best sound currently available? I call that a deal. Even without the dirty flowers"" that are scheduled for release later this year.

Several years ago, there was a well-meaning but ultimately pointless release entitled The Art Of McCartney. That two-disc set was a collection of McCartney songs performed as xerox copies of the obvious choices by an eclectic group of artists. The results ranged from good to embarrassing. It left most listeners with one question in their heads. Why?.

This collection seems to be McCartneys response, and a way to make amends. How does one create a collection - even a 4 disc set - that satisfies the needs of a legion of fans all over the globe who have nurtured, followed, left, returned, gotten older with, and introduced new generations to the music of the cleverest, most prolific - and at times most frustrating banal - composer of culture shifting popular songs? A pop composer whose skill and popularity is rivaled only by Irving Berlin in the 20th century? The answer is, you cant.

Despite the stated intentions of the corporate-McCartney-spin-machine in putting together a collection of my recordings with nothing else in mind other than having something fun to listen to. Maybe to be enjoyed on a long car journey or an evening at home, or at a party with friends this remains a pretty random overview of McCartneys post-Beatles work. Its guaranteed to meet the needs of folks who haven't bought a disc since Band On The Run, just as its guaranteed to frustrate those who have followed Macca through New. Thats Paul McCartney. Havent you learned that by now? So jump in your hot rod or relax in your hot bath and give these ditties a spin..???  (insert groan/grimace).

So what is Pure McCartney? Its simply a superb collection of pop tunes that sound really great - and in the case of some of them, have never sounded better. Get the discs, add some tunes, delete some tunes, re-order the tunes - whatever. This collection is guaranteed to put a song in your heart, taps on your toes, and a smile on your face (even if its not your brave one.) Even you are not one of the legions of rabid Paul fans who have each release, you will be delighted anew by Jet, Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey, Say, Say, Say, and My Love. And you will undoubtably enjoy making your acquaintanceship with Jenny Wren, New, Dance Tonight, and Sing The Changes (wonderful, brave choice that) and others. Special appreciation for the inclusion of Only Mama Knows and Queenie Pie, two truly great songs - if you're unfamiliar with them, you're in for a treat.

That said, lets get the obvious omissions out of the way. First, as I noted in discussion thread on this page, there are no songs from Flowers In The Dirt, one of the strongest albums of McCartneys solo career. The reason is simple: Pure McCartney is a set-up for its release in the Archive series. This way, it is assured that we will all dutifully purchase it to add to our playlists. Paul McCartney is not merely the greatest composer of the past 100 years, he is also a masterful self-promoter, with Donald Trump and J.K. Rowling running a close second and third.  I say that with absolutely no disrespect to Macca given the successful span of his career. But you really will need to get Flowers In The Dirt  when its released later this year.

In terms of omissions, be thankful that we're not subjected to C Moon (It will be L-7/and Ill never get to heaven/if I fill my head with gloom). Or, Mary Had A Little Lamb. Or Temporary Secreta....or yea. Thats here. Oh well. And in fairness, TS has picked up its fair share of fans recently. Second - and less understandable - are some other omissions. Where is So Bad, arguably one of the greatest pop songs of the 1980s. Or Run Devil Run, where McCartney Little RIchards"" his vocal cords in a style not heard since 1965 - proving that he still can. Or at least still could at that point in time. Or the Academy-award nominated (and light weight) Vanilla Sky? Or the perfectly charming Little Lamb Dragonfly from Red Rose Speedway? Better yet - where is the blistering Souvenir from Flaming Pie? Ill stop there. You can add you're own 2 cents. Im sure you all will ;)''Third - Given what was omitted omissions, how on earth did McCartney and his crack team include the atrocious Bip Bop? Or the overly sentimental and treacly Warm And Beautiful ? (Sunlight's morning glory/tells the story/of our love  Moonlight on the water/brings me inspiration/ever after ) Maybe thats the one to listen to in your hot tub.

And alright, all right -  I concede that Temporary Secretary seems to have developed an almost cult-like following that has lead to its inclusion on the current tour - but Winedark Open Sea? Or the creaky, rhetorical Early Days (contradicted by the 3 remaining Beatles themselves in the Anthology DVD set)? Or the dreadfully dated disco ditty Goodnight Tonight? (GT divides fans, much in the same way as Silly Love Songs does, though I love the catchiness of the latter. And SLS is a perfect distillation of McCartneys songwriting philosophy and craft).

I would only add one other point (as Im sure others will pipe in with their piece). Maybe Im Amazed, one of the greatest songs in the McCartney canon was a really, really poor selection as the opening track. (Why start the film with the money shot?) My choice would have been Dance Tonight. With it thump-thump-thump opening, its joyous mandolin, and its message (Everybody gonna stamp their feet/Everybody's gonna feel the beat/Everybody gonna dance around tonight) it would have invited everyone in to have a great time.

And minor gripes aside, thats really what youll have if you get this collection. I pity the naysayers who will be unable to experience the joy of McCartneys music due to either what was included, or what was omitted from this set. Ive defended Paul McCartney quite a bit in the 70s and 80s. That isn't necessary now that hes gotten older, wiser, and more - um, shall we say - clear headed. He was awarded The Gershwin Prize! A Grammy Lifetime Achievement award winner! Hes a MusiCares award winner!  He has had a 46 year career AFTER The Beatles. He survived the loss of the deeply profound love of his life and the subsequent marriage to the bane of his existence. His internal flame of optimism lead him to the spiritual renewal of his marriage to his valentine, Nancy. And throughout all of these ups and downs, he has kept a smile on his face and has provided us with songs that have provided the joyous soundtrack to our own lives. ''And by doing this, Id argue that McCartney has brought more joy and happiness to more people on this planet than any other person. (My God - hes played for both Gorbachev and Putin counting them among his fans (''I had some Russians come up to me and say: 'You say yes; I say no. Hello, goodbye. I am real nowhere man.' '')

Whats the point in complaining about whats wrong in this collection? There is nothing wrong with it. Its just that McCartneys music is so omnipresent -  so inscribed in our consciousness, so deeply personalized - that we all have our opinions about it. Nonetheless, McCartneys preternatural gift for melody and song has, in some way, been a gift to each and every one of us. And our lives are better for his presence.

So, thanks.  To a person Ive never really met (there was that one time seeing him and Nancy  on line for popcorn in a movie theater in  NYC) yet have been on a first-name basis with for 52 years. Godspeed Sir Paul. And again - thank you.

Listen to this collection with appreciation and gratefulness. If you can do that, Pure McCartney is pure gold.'''''",1465516800,5

78176,11259,17631,"Canadian pop duo Tegan and Sara return with their eighth album titled Love You To Death with a clear aim to continue the hyper electronic pop styling of their previous synth-pop masterpiece Heartthrob. Produced by the ubiquitous Greg Kurstin, Love You to Death sounds modern and upbeat with those notable vocal harmonies all over the place but it also lacks a little bit of uniqueness and character that infused their previous album. Whereas Heartthrob made you smile and dance and compelled you to press repeat each time the album ended Love You To Death makes you search for the good stuff before taking it away just as quickly as it appeared. Musically it seems that about half the album is strong while the other half is derivative and even bland at times. The highlights to these ears include the vocal hooks and eighties groove of ""Faint Of Heart"", the gender twisting lyrical sentiment of ""Boyfriend"", the strong driving vibe of ""Stop Desire"", the excellent vocal melodies and alternative progressive message of ""BWU"", and the awesome musical production of ""U-Turn"" which is definitely the strongest track on the entire album. Overall the album simply lacks what is needed to stand out from the crowd and instead is entirely satisfied to mingle among it's peers. Despite the fact that Love You To Death doesn't offer up the musical magic of Heartthrob, it is a decent pop album that suffers from the old musical saying of too much filler not enough killer - 3.5 stars.",1465516800,3

I thought it was a cool concept to have a different bass player for each track on here and even getting Nirvana's Krist Novoselic to appear. However, thats the thing, its just a different bass player. I can't really say that all the tracks sound incredibly different from each other. If you're a hardcore Melvins fan than this album won't be a terrible purchase but if just getting into the group then their early work is where you need to be looking.",1465516800,4

78208,3202,17628,"Some of my earliest popular music memories consist of Paul Simon (and Simon & Garfunkel) songs. My father bought their music in the 1960's and 1970's, so I remember hearing ""The Boxer"", ""Mother and Child Reunion"", ""Me & Julio Down By The Schoolyard"", ""Kodachrome"", ""Slip Sliding Away"", ""Late In The Evening"" and most importantly, as a child of divorce, ""50 Ways To Leave Your Lover"".

All this primed me for 1986's ""Graceland"". I say ""Graceland"" because 1983's ""Hearts and Bones"" didn't even register. So, it was, in the autumn of 1986, that I saw the video for ""You Can Call Me Al"" and then ""The Boy in the Bubble"". I bought the cassette tape of ""Graceland"" in March 1987, and since that time I have bought all of Simon's solo albums and a Simon & Garfunkel ""Best Of"". I have consistently purchase each new Simon album since 1987, though I have not once seen him in concert.

Anyway, ""Stranger To Stranger"" does what I complain most artists do not do--be original, keep experimenting. I give it to Simon, now age 74, for continuing to experiment musically, unlike, say, fellow contemporary, Bob Dylan. ""Stranger To Stranger"" is also lyrically thought provoking, a first for Simon since, well, ""The Rhythm Of The Saints"" (1990). For me, anyway.

""The Werewolf"", ""Wristband"", ""Street Angel"", ""In A Parade"", ""The Riverbank"" and ""Cool Papa Bell"" are all standouts.

The three ballads, ""Stranger To Stranger"", ""Proof Of Love"" and ""Insomniac's Lullaby"" are okay. I've always taken an issue with Simon's ballads as I find them rather bland, usually.

There are two instrumentals, which to me, are disposable: ""The Clock"" and ""In The Garden Of Edie"".

Then there are all those bonus tracks, five to be exact. Disposable, all of them.

So, as you can see, for me, this is four stars, not five. Five would be ""Paul Simon"" (1972), ""There's Goes Rhymin' Simon"" (1973), ""Still Crazy After All These Years"" (1975), ""Graceland"" (1986) and ""The Rhythm Of The Saints"" (1990). I can listen to any of those and not skip a single track. I could sing the entire ""Graceland"" album in my sleep, I know it so well.

Keep rocking (or is it now lilting?) Paul. The music business still needs artist like you. There's so few of you around--Bob Dylan, Randy Newman, The Who, The Rolling Stones, Paul McCartney, Tom Waits, Don Henley, Fleetwood Mac, and....Leonard Cohen.....and.....?

See you in another five years.

This is how ""Stranger To Stranger"" compares to Simon's other solo works:

1972 Paul Simon: Five Stars
1973 There Goes Rhymin' Simon: Five Stars
1975 Still Crazy After All These Years: Five Stars
1980 One Trick Pony: Two Stars

Produced by a range of people including Justin Tranter, Julia Michaels, Mattias Larsson, Robin Fredriksson, Grek Kurstin, and Stefani herself, This Is What The Truth Feels Like sounds modern with lots of different song styles backed up by interesting electronic production that creates a satisfying listening experience. Gwen Stefani is singing at the top of her game here with strong powerful vocals and her uniquely quirky lyrical style. Highlights include the familiar electro dance grooves of first single ""Make Me Like You"", the organic production and emotional sentiment of ""Truth"", the epic ballad and great vocal hooks of ""Used To Love You"", and the moody slow burner ""Me Without You"". The international deluxe edition includes a mammoth five bonus tracks including the sultry vocals of ""Getting Warmer"" and the smooth production of ""Splash"" that builds to a memorable chorus. To her credit, Gwen Stefani has produced a very strong solo album that is long yet entertaining, emotional yet fun, and modern yet warm and familiar. This Is What The Truth Feels Like is a great offering to fans of this evergreen artist and no doubt shows that there is even bigger and better things ahead in her future.",1465516800,4
78219,12631,227,"""That girl took that song away from me."" It was the summer of 1967. Otis Redding was in the midst of the performance of his life at the Monterey International Pop Festival. What he was referring to of course was the way Aretha Franklin had turned his song ""Respect"" into one of the biggest hits of the year. His version topped out at #35 on the pop charts a couple of years earlier. But I digress. Otis Redding was just beginning to hit his stride as summer turned to autumn in 1967. This veteran performer had been around for a while. The fact is that up until this point he had made the Billboard Hot 100 a total of 19 times although his records usually ran out of gas somewhere in the middle of the chart. His tunes fared much better on the Soul/R&B charts where 8 of them had made it into the Top Ten. It is really difficult to understand why the man had not had greater commercial success up until this point. After taking a few months off Otis Redding returned to the studio in early December 1967. There he recorded a song he had co-written with Steve Cropper. Everyone thought it was a mistake. His wife hated it. Three days later Otis Redding was dead at 26, a victim of a tragic plane crash in Wisconsin.

When the story appeared in the newspaper I remember thinking to myself ""Who is that?"" And although I had been collecting records for about three years I had never heard of him. Despite his enormous talent Otis Redding had just not quite connected with general audiences. Less than two months later in January of 1968, Volt records released that tune his wife and friends hated so much. ""(Sitting On) The Dock of the Bay"" went all the way to #1 on the Pop charts and remained there for a month. Everyone now finally realized just how talented this man had been.  An American classic.",1465516800,5

78232,524,17178,"""A New Dream"" is the third solo piano release from Lynn Tredeau. Tredeaus 2015 debut, Echoes of Life, received world-wide attention and reached #1 on Spa Channel, #2 on One World Music Radio and was nominated for Best Piano Album - Solo by OWM. Her second album, Snowlight (A Christmas Memory) was nominated for Album of the Year by SoloPiano.com and OWM. Tredeau was also nominated as Best New Artist on EnlightenedPianoRadio.com. Thats a hard act to follow, but Tredeaus gentle touch on the piano keys and her musical messages of love and hope should send this album shooting up the charts as well. A very active musician in her youth, Tredeau set those aspirations aside to raise her family. Later on, she was inspired by the music of Michele McLaughlin and re-immersed herself in music - and began creating her own music. She has obviously chosen the right path for this segment of her life!

""A New Dream"" begins with Awaken, a warm and soothing piece that is as delicate as the morning sky. Relaxed and optimistic, its a lovely opening! Deepest Part of the Lake is about peaceful moments spent in a boat in the middle of a lake, reflecting on lifes important questions. The gentle rhythms of this piece bring images of light dancing on water and the soft movement of the lake itself. Courageous is one of my favorites. A bit darker than most of the thirteen pieces, it seems to be reflecting on the loss of a fallen hero. Lunch With Vincent imagines what it would be like to have lunch with VanGogh in a Paris cafe. A light and playful waltz with a slightly French flavor, this is a very pleasant lunch, indeed! Pixie Dance is played mostly in the higher registers of the piano, giving this sweet bit of musical sunshine a hint of magic. Winter Thaw sparkles like light reflecting off the snow, yet expresses a chill in the air and the promise of a coming spring. The Land of Enchantas is my favorite piece on the album and was composed as a theme song for a trilogy of fantasy novels by the same name. Sometimes mysterious and sometimes lighter and fanciful, this piece has a bit more drama as well as a sense of adventure. The almost fragile A Quiet Memory is a whisper of a piece - reflective and nostalgic. Innocence is very simple and honest, much like its inspiration. Shadow of Your Absence brings the album to a close with poignance and deep emotion.

""A New Dream"" is an excellent follow-up to Lynn Tredeaus first two albums! Recommended!",1465603200,5
78233,1463,17178,"Some of our dreams occur when we are asleep, and then there are those we dream when we are awake our goals, desires, and visions for what we want in life. For pianist composer Lynn Tredeau, one of her dreams has been to create beautiful emotionally expressive music to share with the world. And with her third album, A New Dream, she continues making that dream a reality.

The first track on A New Dream is appropriately titled Awaken. I was immediately captured by the songs gentle flow and also intrigued by the shifting currents of Lynns pleasantly surprising chord changes. The inspiration for track 3, Living in a Dream touches on a universal theme of gratitude and is a reminder not to take the gifts we have and the people we love for granted. I found this songs tender heartfelt melody quite emotionally evocative. Inspired by a Van Gogh painting, Lunch With Vincent is written as a waltz in 3/4 time and sparkles with an uplifting ambiance, as does the next track entitled Pixie Dance, with its enchanting music box-like melody. Providing a bit of a yin yang contrast to these last few songs is another waltz called Winter Thaw, that has a more somber, yet hopeful feel.

On Land of Enchantas,I particularly enjoyed the various movements it evolved through, varying from a darker feel, as played on the lower registers of the piano, to light dancing melodies on the higher registers, creating a lovely balance that worked well with the song's fantasy theme. And speaking of balance, on the last three songs, the poignant ambiance of Ocean of Tears and Shadow of Your Absence, contrast with the tender sweetness of Innocence, which evoked the feeling of looking into the eyes of a new born baby.

A New Dream by Lynn Tredeau provides a journey through a diversity of emotional landscapes, shaped by deeply personal experiences and universal themes. Throughout the album, Lynn allows herself to be vulnerable in expressing her joys and sorrows, and in doing so, creates an empathetic response in the listener that mirrors many of our own feelings and life experiences. Lynns melodies and motifs range from simple and stark like bare trees in winter, to effulgent as in the blossoming of spring. Im sure that this new release, like her previous ones, will find wide acceptance and will be the next step in furthering Lynns dream of sharing her expressive music with the world.

78242,56,17798,"If there is one thing that I have always adored about Phil Collins is that he has made some of the most everlasting music of our times. Hard to believe that it has been 35 years since he had made his solo debut with Face Value, and all of his songs are just as timeless today, as they were originally recorded back in the 1980's to the 2000's. I have always loved the heart and soul put into each of his albums, and my personal favorite album would be But Seriously. Not just because the songs are brilliantly soulful, and show sincerity from the heart. His songs have had deeper meanings at times, than what critics have mistakenly not seen from the heart. Another Day In Paradise is one of my all time favorite Phil Collins songs. The song which was made back in 1989, has as much importance today about the neglect and abuse that the homeless receive all this time. The song touches the soul deeply about how very sever people do not give back, and purposely segregate the less-fortunate that have no places to live, or cannot have a stable environment from their treatments on the street or in shelters. The song, and its video really touch a very serious nerve that many people have taken for granted overall. This is a kind of song that so many joke artists from Beyonce' Knowles and Rihanna would never record for themselves, and if they did they would only show less than half of the seriousness that Phil Collins out into this song. If you had never heard a Phil Collins song when he was on his own or with Genesis before, than this is the one song I sincerely recommend you download first. You could download or listen to In The Air Tonight for the drive, but this is one song you have to listen to from the soul.

78243,9180,17799,"Three stars is, in Amazon parlance, ""It's Okay"" and that's really where this sits, it's two hours of pure white noise for under a buck. It helps in the afternoons to drown out the sounds of the neighborhood, lawnmowers, leaf blowers, loud cars and trucks. Nothing really special about the track but it gets the job done and does help me fall asleep but not that much better than streaming some smooth jazz, sounds of nature or even some classic rock depending on my mood.

I am a huge fan of the atmosphere created in a songs that create strong eemotions ions within me. This band is easily one of my top 10, and this new album reiterates how amazing their music is and how hard it is not to repeat a song after hearing it. Far and away my favorite song on this record is ""gone with the wind"" which I really identify with. The title track is solid and ""nihilist"" really makes it hard not to repeat for an hour.

And this really helped Ashley Monroe's career also.
I don't think there is a bad song on this cd.  The title song Hell On Heels, Lemon Drops, Bad Example,Takin' Pills are all highlights.  Boys From The South,and Family Feud are done with the right attitude.  Miranda always showed plenty of attitude.  And with this you get three times as much.

They seem heavily influenced by an album from 1997: Black Flowers by The Geoff Smith Band.  Instructive to listen to Flowers and then Hopelessness to see how sounds can evolve.  Some songs on this album definitely show more work than others, complex layers and viscous lyrics, while others seem more like raw poetry set to a simple riff to move it forward in a hypnotic way.  The old poets used to do that w droning/hypnotic voices, but todays listeners pref music to get there  all good, but could be a problem for those expecting a more consistent album w most tracks like first few (from comments here, I see some were challenged and didn't like it).

78314,7472,17778,"One of Van Morrison's finest live albums (or one his finest albums period), ""It's Too Late to Stop Now"" has been amended with this set which features three (nearly) complete concerts (I don't think there's much in the way of music missing just between song patter, etc.) on CD as well as a DVD of one of his 1973 Rainbow concerts.

The original ""Now"" was a two LP affair (the last reissue did include ""Brown Eyed Girl"" from this collection but the rest is previously unreleased) and the CD, likewise, was two CD's as well. This set make have some duplicate songs but it has NO duplicate performances for the shows included on CD.

Let's start with the mastering--Vic Anesini (Sony/BMG's in-house mastering engineer and one of the best out there IMHO) does a great job of mastering this release. It's dynamic, has nice depth and detail without losing dynamics. These are all remixed from the original 16 track multi-tracks.

The performances are stellar--drawn from three venues between May, June and July 1973 at the Troubadour, Santa Monica Civic and London's Rainbow Theatre. These are unadorned performances---there are no overdubs and no duplicate performances (although there are duplicate songs but the set lists vary). James Brown may have been the hardest working man in showbiz but Van and his band from this time were a close second.

Please note: it appears that there is one duplicate song from the previous set but is remixed--""Into The Mystic"".The performance sounds VERY similar.

The DVD features a terrific show from the Rainbow Theatre as well (keep in mind that Van did multiple performances at each venue during this tour). My only complaint is I wish that we would have had 1) more than one choice when it comes to format 2) I would have loved the CD available as 5.1 mixes (but then they do want us to buy more product, right?). Blu-ray could have held ALL of the concerts in lossless 5.1 mixes as well as the live footage.

The packaging is nice but could have been a bit better--the CD's and the DVD come in a digipak with each disc in a plastic tray. The booklet only includes some photos, a brief comment on the shows and credits. It would have been nice to have some context for the concerts with a great booklet. Yes, I know some people could careless but there are those who do. The music, though, is the ultimate goal and from that perspective, this is a big winner.

A classic album gets four siblings expanding on a classic live album.

Highly recommended.",1465603200,5

78319,5570,17785,"This is a very cool first time ever career-spanning post -Beatles cd box set from Paul. I give it 5 stars all the way simply because it's unique and it has versatility. Paul and team chose and hand picked these tracks for us. The sound quality is amazing. The book with photos is worth this set alone. This set is actually not meant to be a substitute for past compilations like Wingspan or the recent archive re-releases but it is exactly what Paul had in mind for this set: enjoyable for all settings. The sequencing of the songs together on the four discs is fun and interesting. The well known classics from throughout the years are here mixed in with the deeper tracks and gems. As fans, we notice some omissions...but that's ok...because many of those gaps are actually filled and found on the 3 DVD set from 2007 called ""The McCartney Years""...which can actually serve as a nice companion piece to this set. That set included his footage and videos from the 70's, 80's and 90's as well as classic concert footage. So back to this set: there is basically not much I would change about this set at all...but..did notice each disc has some extra room for a couple of more songs or so for each disc if they were to be added for a cool total of 74 tracks or some possible subs for other songs ..but that's just minor stuff. Examples: would have like to see the songs: Young Boy & Letting Go(currently on his concert setlist) in place of: Waterfalls and Appreciate. Also would have like to seen Bluebird, Hope of Deliverance, and Take it Away in place of songs: Girlfriend, Winedark open Sea, and We all Stand Together. With the extra room, adding Ever Present Past, That was Me, Friends to Go or Follow Me would have been cool somewhere but as mentioned...minor stuff...all good.. Another note, my favorite McCartney album, from 1997, Flaming Pie, right off the Beatles Anthology, is highly represented here with 8 tracks. Although i do miss the track Young Boy for this set, it's really good to hear many of these songs mixed in. Next year actually marks the 20th anniversary of the release of Flaming Pie. Let's hope for an archive re-release for Flaming Pie. Thinkin of a 2cd/dvd set hopefully which would include the album, rare tracks/demos and the In the World Tonight documentary. Overall, this set: Pure McCartney, is a high thumbs up for the all time fans as well as anyone new who is discovering this great music for this first time. Enjoy!!",1465603200,5

78322,18,17785,"Music: 5 stars; Compilation: 2 stars; Sequencing: 2 stars; New relevance: none.

It's of course pure coincidence, but with McCartney scheduled to come to Cincinnati in early July, I've been going through another Macca re-appreciation phase. I have many of his CDs (but certainly not all). Recently there was the new biography ""Paul McCartney: The Life"" by noted rock biographer Philip Norman. And now there is this, a new 'best of' compilation (the first one since 2001's ""Wingspan""), and on top of that, personally curated/selected by Sir Paul himself.

""Pure McCartney"" (4CDs; 67 tracks; 257 min.) is a head-scratcher from start to finish for me. Let's start with the obvious: there is a TON of great music on here, opening perfectly with ""Maybe I'm Amazed"" from his debut solo album, and then quickly going to a selection from the Ram album (""Heart of the Country""), and by track 3 we are already in Band on the Run territory (""Jet""). By the time we are at the end of CD1 and going into CD2, I can't make heads or tails as to the sequencing of these tracks. It seems frankly all over the place and without any rhyme or reasons. Then, what is even more remarkable is what is MISSING on this compilation. Despite being a generous 4 CDs, there is NOT A SINGLE TRACK from the 1989 'comeback' album Flowers In the Dirt. Hence, no ""My Brace Face"" (a genuine hit, actually), or the touching ""Put It There"" or ""Figure of Eight"". How in the world is this possible? Surely I am not the first one to notice this, and Macca management asked Sir Paul about it. Also missing, just to mentioning these: ""Take It Away"" (a hit from Tug of War), ""Hope Of Deliverance"" (the delightful and warm 1st single from ""Off the Ground"" (and a genuine hit), and ""Wonderful Christmastime"", an iconic song that, despite its mere seasonal appeal, should be on here. And the worst of it is that we really shouldn't have this discussion as the 4 CDs as they are contain free space of good for about 40 min. worth of music, meaning another 7 or 8 songs could've easily be added to what is here.

Bottom line: I'm not sure for whom this compilation is intended: the casual (?) fan, if there is such a thing, or the die-hard fan? If you are the latter, you already have everything on here as there is no new or unreleased music of any kind. I would much rather see a ""McCartney Anthology"" release, patterned after the Beatles Anthology, with outtakes, demos, unreleased songs, live material, Just one example:""The Mess"" was a live track from Wings' European tour in summer of 1972 (released as the B side of ""My Love"", later included in the reissue of ""Red Rose Speedway""). This surely isn't the only song recorded on that tour? Let us have more! Now that would be something! Meanwhile, I am looking forward to seeing Sir Paul live in Cincinnati in early July!

*UPDATE* I saw Macca in concert a few days ago. Fabulous 2 hr. 45 min. show, The guy looks at least 15 years younger than he is (74). Five years after his last show in Cincinnati. I compared the setlists of both. Remarkably, he played TWENTY songs not heard in the 2011 show. Thank you, Sir Paul.",1465603200,3

78326,14868,17588,"Tiger Army are always evolving and never put out the same material in a different form. Sure, each album may sound completely different from previous albums, but that's one of the things that makes them such a great band. V is an amazing album, a perfect combination of Tiger Army's heavy psychobilly along with hauntingly beautiful slow songs like Happier Times. This is the type of album you can put on the turntable and listen to from start to finish--over and over again.",1465603200,5
78327,7448,17808,"The album isn't out yet, but this is the second release from Never Alone.  Monster is goth-rock with catchy harmonics and a bit of pop. I despise pop. But they have just the right mixture to make it all come together and work well. It is challenging to find much on this band - they appear to have gone through a few phases before finding themselves with the current look and sound.  I did sample earlier work and some of it was pretty good.

If you dig the sound, check out Finally Free and Event Horizon (first and third release from Never Alone), which drops June 17,2016.",1465603200,5

78373,482,13078,"Shawn Colvin's ""Uncovered"" got a number of lackluster reviews for being too bland, too soft.  It is a quiet acoustic disc with tempos largely on the slower side.  But there are some real gems here, well worth repeated listening that make the set indeed welcome.  Perhaps my very favorite is Paul Simon's ""American Tune"" which is such a fine song, giving voice to idealistic disappointment.  Sean's voice aches expressively and polishes Simon's gorgeous melody, ""Many's the time I've been mistaken, and many times confused; and I've often felt forsaken and certainly misused.""  The Brenton Wood hit ""Gimme A Little Sign"" has a little more bounce than the surrounding tracks with Sean's pace slower than the original, letting her stretch out the lyrical feeling.  ""Where is my God, He lives inside on me,"" Shawn sings on the Stevie Wonder-penned devotional ""Heaven Is Ten Zillion Light Years Away.""  Other tracks are strong like her take on ""Baker Street,"" Neil Finn's ""Private Universe"" & the country arrangement of ""Lodi.""  ""Uncovered"" is a strong, albeit quiet set.  Enjoy!",1465689600,4

78399,10192,16513,"World renowned as a piano virtuoso and music composer, Fiona Joy released Signature  Synchronicity in 2016. In 2015, Fiona released Signature  Solo and its follow up, Signature  Synchronicity takes her music to a whole new level of sonic excellence. Taking the solo piano music of Signature  Solo and reproducing it with number of musicians, the results make Signature  Synchronicity Fionas most exhilarating album to date. Commenting on the differences between the two albums, Fiona told CD reviews site mwe3.com, I took the same 10 songs and recorded them on a hand made contemporary Australian piano with 97 keys in an edited, overdubbed studio environment with full orchestration. Totally different worlds! I added lyrics, many layers of instrumentation and yet the piano parts are identical almost note for note, taking the keyboard length variations into account. I wanted the listener to see how different each approach can be. The approach may be different but the music sparkles in a new and different setting. The production work of Will Ackerman, Tom Eaton and James Englund adds to the sonic experience. Recorded in both Australia and the U.S., Signature  Synchronicity also benefits thanks to the added input from key musicians such as Tony Levin (NS bass), Marc Shulman (electric guitar), Will Ackerman (guitar), Tom Eaton (keyboard pads) Jeff Oster (flugelhorn), Borbala Bodonyi (backing vocals), Nick Hawkins (beat box), Jeff Haynes (percussion), Eugene Friesen (cello) Rebecca Daniel (violin) and others. While the basic piano themes of Signature  Synchronicity were first explored on the Signature  Solo album, the music gets a new shine on these newly recorded versionsproving that great music can work in any production setting. An ethereal and captivating listening experience flowing with lush melodies and exquisite production techniques, Signature  Synchronicity is Fiona Joys most celestial-sounding music yet.",1465689600,5

Their first single The Devil's Bleeding Crown is as heavy as it gets. Marie Laveau is awesome but not very heavy, the title track Seal the Deal & Let's Boogie is very satisfying, and the last track The Loa's Crossroads is pretty heavy and very nice.

To be honest I couldn't pay attention to the rest. It became noise in the background. It didn't really interest me at all. It's not a bad album, all the songs are well written and played, I just prefer it much heavier and catchy. I even bought the Best Buy addition for the extra songs. The first song on there is called Slaytan and it's awesome! Sadly it's 58 seconds long lol.",1465689600,4

Bill Burr is one of my all-time favorite comedians. His albums have great replayability: I find myself coming back to them every few months and I still laugh out loud. He's starting to make some TV and film appearances, which leaves me a little conflicted (I'm thrilled to see his career take off, but nervous he'll stop doing new stand-up). Anyway, you owe it to yourself to get this album and all of his others. A lot of his stuff is available on a prominent interNET service that streams movies & FLIX. I have some favorite tracks from this, but I'm not listing them because you need to get the album and listen to it in it's entirety.

If you like Bill Burr's comedy, I would also recommend Tom Segura, John Mulaney, Louis CK, Tommy Johnagin, Nate Bargatze, & Pete Homes. I enjoy Patton Oswalt & Jim Gaffigan, too, but they're already pretty well-known.",1465689600,5

And the Lost ones were pretty neat, definitely liked the finished forms but it was neat hearing how a lot of the songs got started. I don't know about anyone else but Enigma is oxygen for me.

Most of the performances are first rate.  A few are good but do not rise to the level of the majority, thus the Four Stars.  I was happily surprised to see that many of the trumpet solos were played by Helmut Wobisch.  I have not found any of his recordings for quite some time.  He and Adolf Scheerbaum were the most famous German trumpet soloists of their time and deservedly so.  Highly Recommended at this incredible price!!",1465689600,4
78492,1665,17827,"I have to say that I wasn't all that keen on Tom Odell's debut, Long Way Down, but I saw him give a magnificent performance of Magnetised on Radio 1 Live Lounge (still available on the BBC iPlayer and YouTube and well worth catching, along with his incredible cover of I Took A Pill In Ibiza from the same set.)  That persuaded me to try Wrong Crowd.  I'm glad I did, because it's a good album with some cracking highlights.

This is a more highly-produced and slightly less grindingly downbeat album, and it benefits from both, I think.  There are certainly intense songs and plenty of heartbreak, but the atmosphere is one of poignancy and insight rather than pure poor-me misery, and it's a very powerful listen in places.  The title track and the superb Magnetised get the album off to a great start, as does Concrete, which has a great stripped-back, beaty sound and shows a really nice witty but tender side to Tom's lyrics:
""I'd sleep
On a bed that's made of
Concrete,
Just the two of us and
No sheet,
Just your feet
Rubbing up against mine""

Not all of the lyrics are so good, mind you; Sparrow's lyrics are fey and very clich-ed, even if it is rather a lovely song, for example.  I also found the production just a bit samey and over-reliant on mixed-forward percussion, and I could have done with a bit more variety of sound.  However, as an album I like it a lot  and the closing track of the Deluxe Edition, I Thought I Knew What Love Was, is an absolutely heartrending piece of brilliance, I think.

A very good album, then, and very recommendable.  I'm looking forward to more Tom Odell; he's very good now and on this evidence I think he may develop into something really special.",1465689600,4

Nick doesn't need any guest singers or rappers to show that he is talented. The special guests may be talented, but the way some of the raps were sequenced into his song sounds awkward.

It would become one of the biggest hits of the summer of 1968. In an interview with Goldmine Williams described the song in this way: ""half flamenco, half Flatt & Scruggs, and half classical."" In fact this song actually garnered 3 Grammy awards as ""Best Instrumental Arrangement"", ""Best Contemporary-Pop Performance"" and ""Best Instrumental Theme"".

78607,12631,17841,"She was the leading solo singer of the 1960's ""girl group"" sound. Born in Manhattan and raised in Tenafly, NJ Leslie Gore released a single every 10-12 weeks during her heyday between 1963 and 1968. Her biggest hits occurred at the beginning. Songs like ""It's My Party"", ""Judy's Turn To Cry"" and ""She's A Fool"" were all huge hits for her back in 1963. Personally, I prefer several of her later releases one of which was 1965's ""Look of Love"". This bright bouncy tune peaked at #27 in the early part of that year.  This is the original Mercury single release you would remember from the radio.",1465776000,5

This multi-talented individual was also a folk guitarist, songwriter, author and photographer among other things. In 1968 he recorded the Grammy-award winning instrumental ""Classical Gas"". It would become one of the biggest hits of the summer of 1968. In an interview with Goldmine Williams described the song in this way: ""half flamenco, half Flatt & Scruggs, and half classical."" In fact this song actually garnered 3 Grammy awards as ""Best Instrumental Arrangement"", ""Best Contemporary-Pop Performance"" and ""Best Instrumental Theme"".  This sounds every bit as fresh today as it did when it was recorded nearly 50 years ago.",1465776000,5

78668,12631,17850,"Like Little Willie John and Jesse Belvin before him Billy Stewart remains a largely unknown and vastly underrated figure in the history of R&B. Billy Stewart was discovered by the legendary Bo Diddley who was so impressed by his ability to play the piano that he asked Billy to join his band back in 1956. Diddley even got Stewart a recording contract with his record label Chess in the late 1950s. Nothing much came of it for a couple of years but beginning in 1962 he made several outstanding and really unique records. Billy finally struck pay dirt in the summer of 1965 with a beautiful song called ""Sitting In The Park"". It was becoming apparent to an increasing number of music buffs that this man was going to be a star.",1465862400,5

New Rush is excellent, and most of the other songs will likely grow on you, and some of the experimentation is really cool. But a couple of songs would've been better left to other artists with to cover, as they just don't fit Wigmore's voice /or vocal range.

I wonder what the ZZ stands for? Is ZZ the lead singer.? what's up with them there beards? I knew a band called AA Dreidel. Very similar to ZZ Top. I also like the Spinners. Somehow that seems related.

78730,12631,2418,"When Tommy James was just 13 years old, he and a group of junior high school buddies formed a rock `n roll band in their hometown of Niles, Michigan. They called themselves The Shondells. The group caught the eye of a local record producer and the Shondells were given a chance to cut a record. The Shondells released a tune called ""Judy"" in 1962. Although that record went nowhere, a local DJ that was starting a new label late in 1963 decided to give The Shondells another shot. They recorded a tune called ""Hanky Panky"" on the fledgling Snap label and this time they had themselves a local hit. However, the record never received any airplay outside the local area. Fast forward now to 1966 when Tommy James received a bizarre phone call from a promoter in Pittsburgh with an urgent request that he come to town to do a live concert. Since Tommy had never even been to Pittsburgh he had no idea what was going on. As it turned out, this promoter had found a copy of ""Hanky Panky"" in a used record bin. He liked it so much that he began playing it at dances all around town. Suddenly, radio stations in Pittsburgh were getting requests for this tune. Tommy James packed his bags and headed for the Steel City. The original Shondells had broken up so if was going to do concerts he would need a band to back him up. He hired a local Pittsburgh outfit called the Reconteurs to fill the bill and Tommy James and the Shondells were born. Soon thereafter the group signed with Morris Levy's Roulette records and re-recorded ""Hanky Panky"". This new recording was a bit more uptempo than the original and was an immediate smash. ""Hanky Panky"" would climb all the way to the top of the Billboard Hot 100 Singles chart and would remain there for two weeks. Tommy James and the Shondells were on their way.  Though this was never one of my favorite Tommy James songs the story behind the story is pretty interesting.",1465862400,3

78732,291,17857,"The great William Bell is back with Stax where he first arrived 55 years ago, and the result is is one of the finest traditional soul albums of the century, rivaled only by the late Otis Clay, Johnny Rawls and Bettye LaVette.  This is superlative Memphis-style southern soul, no matter if it was recorded in NYC and produced by a man (John Leventhal) more associated with alternative country, particularly the magnificent albums of his wife Rosanne Cash.  As a matter of fact, Leventhal and Cash wrote one of the many new masterpieces contained here, the warmly and deeply soulful and wise ""Walking on a Tightrope.""  I wouldn't be surprised if they also had the idea for William Bell to cover the ultra-poignant and and wise (wisdom about growing old with a lifetime of experience) ""All Your Stories,"" the stunning acoustic-ballad closer from Jesse Winchester's 1972 landmark alternative country LP ""Third Down, 110 to Go.""

William Bell co-wrote everything else here, including his 1960s masterpiece (one of several) ""Born Under a Bad Sign,"" immortalized as an all-time Memphis Stax blues classic in 1967 by the incomparable Albert King.  For this revival of the song, Bell and Leventhal wisely make it more of a steadily-building acoustic-led blues, rather than trying to compete with Albert King's electric guitar pyrotechnics.

The rest are all newly written songs by Bell and Leventhal, some with Marc ""Walking in Memphis"" Cohn.  ""Mississippi-Arkansas Bridge"" mixes Memphis with a Tony Joe White-like mlange of bayou blues, rock and soul.  So many others are hauntingly poignant, pensive and personal (""More Rooms,"" ""The Three of Me,"" ""The House Always Wins,"" ""All the Things I Can't Remember"").  ""Poison in the Well"" is a pulsating grabber about a woman so tempting she can precipitate a man's fall from grace; while ""I Will Take Care of You"" is a purely devotional slow southern ballad.

The title song (""This Is Where I Live"") is autobiographical and extols Memphis as his home.  ""People Want to Go Home"" is the moving closer all about returning home, and it features a superbly soulful chorus behind him.

This beautifully produced and performed album is of 39 minutes duration, but it feels as though I just read an autobiography of the man and artist, William Bell, that delves deep into his emotions and his soul.  The world's greatest author on the subject of soul music, Peter Guralnick, contributed three pages of brilliant liner notes to this project.  I agree so much with his statement that ""[the] combination of introspection and universality is what has always given William's music its unique feel...""  Never more so than now,

This is phenomenal, and we can only hope there will be more like it.",1465862400,5

78757,12282,15953,"I have maintained for some time that the very best contemporary instrumental music is written for the movies.  Like Alexandre Desplat's score for THE KING'S SPEECH, Roque Banos' score for RISEN made a big if mainly subconscious impact on me when I heard it in the movie theater.  Hearing the score again, in isolation via digital download helps me to appreciate more fully how truly exciting the opening ""battle"" music is (Track #1), how haunting the more lyrical theme associated with Clavius' acceptance of Jesus Christ is (Track #9 and others), and how atmospheric and evocative of the ancient world -- of Roman brutality and of Jewish mysticism -- the score as a whole is.  Banos, clearly a gifted composer, has created the perfect score for an extraordinary addition to the ""Biblical movie"" canon.",1465862400,5

78759,12631,3379,"When you pause to consider Linda Ronstadt's entire body of work over a period of four decades it it difficult not to come to the conclusion that Linda really is one of the great singers of the past half century. She is more than capable of singing all manner of material from rock and roll to country to tunes from the Great American Songbook.

In 1965 Linda Ronstadt moved to Los Angeles and was a founding member of the Stone Poneys. Within a relatively short period of time the group signed a recording contract with Capitol records and in 1967 had a pretty impressive Top 20 hit with a tune called ""Different Drum"". Linda did a terrific job singing lead on that record and Capitol decided that they had a potential star on their hands. In 1970, Linda Ronstadt would have her very first hit as a solo artist. The song ""Long Long Time"" remains my very favorite Ronstadt tune of all time. Here is the most poignant song about the pain of unrequited love that you will ever hear. I still get chills each and every time I hear it.  Without a doubt a five star performance.",1465862400,5

While I enjoyed much of his work as lead guitarist with The Beatles I was really not too sure that he could make it as a solo artist. My doubts were quickly dispelled in the late fall of 1970 when Harrison released his epic 3 LP set ""All Things Must Pass"". George Harrison's debut LP as a solo act was an immediate smash. In the years that followed I found that much to my surprise George's work as a solo artist was by far the most interesting to me of all of the Fab Four.  One of my very favorite Harrison tunes was his 1987 cover version of James Ray's 1962 hit ""I've Got My Mind Set On You"".  Much to everyone's surprise the release would become George Harrison's last #1 record.  I think it is fair to say that in this case the re-make is much better than the original.",1465862400,5

78798,10506,14411,"Back in 1979, I had Bonnie Pointers HEAVEN MUST HAVE SENT YOU song on one of those K-tel compilation albums and thought it was an ok hybrid of Disco and vintage Motown but I found her voice kind of thin and reedy not unlike Diana Ross.  When Big Break Records released this remastered deluxe CD I decided to make a blind-buy purchase since I loved what they had done with a large chunk of the Pointer Sisters catalog.

At first I wasn't that impressed, but this album has grown on me and so have Bonnies vocal stylings. She displays such versatility here as she tackles lite jazz on FREE ME FROM MY FREEDOM, another retro Motown offering on WHEN IM GONE and some red-hot funky R&B on AH SHOOT. But my favorites on the album are the stripped-down, acoustic numbers MORE AND MORE, I LOVE TO SING TO YOU, I WANNA MAKE IT (IN YOUR WORLD) and the piano ballad MY EVERYTHING. These are just beautiful in their simplicity and allow Bonnies voice to shine through and really move the listener.

Sound quality is terrific on this remaster and best of all is that theyve included the 12 versions and single versions of FREE ME FROM MY FREEDOM and HEAVEN MUST HAVE SENT YOU. Both are better than the album versions with a hot bass-driven break in the former but the latter must be heard to be believedits an extended mix that has this mesmerizing instrumental interlude where the frantically-scrubbed guitars and screeching violins battle it out. It sounds like something out of the famous PSYCHO shower scene and will give you goosebumps.

This albums a grower and is definitely the best of the solo Pointer Sisters offerings. FIVE STARS.",1465862400,5

78863,2600,17628,"I really like this album by Paul Simon.  He has always had the ability to uplift me and soothe me with his voice  My favorite song is ""Wristband"". The bass playing on this song is really groovy.  Only Paul Simon can sing a song about wearing a wristband sound cool.  I love the horns playing on the song ""Cool Papa Bell"". This song makes me feel happy. I can tap my feet to the beat of the songs ""The Werewolf and In A Parade"".  These songs are so enjoyable to listen to.  There are two great instrumental tracks on this album.  In the Garden of Edie"" is simply a minute and half of soothing guitar playing. This is a lovely tribute to his wife. I love the simplicity of a song like ""The Clock"". The chimes featured on this song are beautiful.  ""Street Angel"" is an upbeat song about the sacrifices that street performers make for their craft.  The drums playing on ""Street Angel"" are very good. I love the saxophone playing on the song "" Stranger To Stranger"". ""Insomniac Lullaby"" is a lovely song.  I will play this song when I am unable to sleep.  Paul Simon sounds so peaceful on this song.  I love the song ""Duncan"".  It is a good story song about coming of age.  ""Duncan"" is actually an older song from the seventies, but it sounds fresh performed live on this CD.  I love this music by Paul Simon.",1465948800,5

This small, four track album is the result. Simply put, this album is a mess and simply isn't the greatest hits collection that its advertised as. These four tracks, also included on Tates Frequency Unknown record under the Queensryche, simply aren't up to the quality of the original tracks. Tates voice has declined over the passage of a quarter of century and that is clearly evident here, especially on I Dont Believe in Love. The session musician trying to take the bands place simply isn't up to the job. Add in some poor production efforts and this album is the result. All four of these songs are easily avaliable on their original albums (Operation Mindcrime for I Dont Believe in Love while the other three are on Empire) with better singing, music and production.

79017,10941,8706,"THE WATERFALL is my first My Morning Jacket purchase & I am ecstatic!!!  I did listen to samples, which only scratch the surface on this gorgeous piece of music with outstandingly beautiful vocals!!

From start to finish, THE WATERFALL is music as art.  For me...it's music for those ""mellow/chill"" moments (not what I'd listen to driving!  Different music for different moods!).  If music were a massage, 'THE WATERFALL' would be the BEST massage you've ever had!  It's not merely pleasing to listen to; it's an uplifting, ethereal experience!!  Just listen & float to a higher plane as it transports you, leaving all your worldly cares behind.  ""BIG DECISIONS"" is the Big Song here.  It will (mostly likely) pull you out of your trance, since It is literally ""bigger"" & bolder than other songs, but it's well worth it; it is such a SPECTARULAR Song!! - The one I first heard that led me to listen to the samples, read some customer reviews & to the purchase of THE WATERFALL in the first place!

The cover artwork (& inside) is also absolutely striking!  Whoever purchased the lp version can appreciate it even more!  The only other time I've heard music this pretty is from Mazzy Star (Hope Sandoval).  Now, there would be a dream duet: Jim James & Hope Sandoval.  But, I will take this as the gift that it is....that these highly talented musicians of My Morning Jacket created such a masterpiece in THE WATERFALL for our listening pleasure, and it IS my pleasure!!!",1466035200,5

79021,10941,16882,"I had heard ""HUMAN PERFORMANCE"" (the song) and thought (and most of you will think, ""she's gotta be trippin'""!)  But, I actually have a very keen ear, musically & have been told this by many people & some in the industry.  When I first heard it, my thoughts didn't turn to Velvet Underground, as seems to be the general concensus.  No, I, of course, always seem to ""zig"" when others  zag""!  I thought of Jimi Hendrix!  And, please let me explain, so I don't seem totally from another planet!  The guitar, of course, is nothing alike.  The style isn't at all similar.  But, there is something in the singing, or the enunciation of Andrew Savage that just subtely hints at Jimi H.  Otherwise, nothing alike! REALLY!!  When I saw the music video, Andrew Savage couldn't look less like Jimi Hendrix if they were a different species. Which is perfectly alright...PARQUET COURTS are a really great band!

I'm enjoying this CD immensely!!!  I can listen over & over & I can only do that with a handfull.  I love all the songs, but ""HUMAN PERFORMANCE"" is definitely my favorite.  I am, though, getting a big kick out of the song ""Dust""!!!  It's great to find a band with a sense of humor about them, too!  Even better is they hail from Texas & instead of swinging by Austin (or relocating to Portland, as has become popular; I don't think I need say more on that!) came to Brooklyn!!!  Curiousor & curiousor...this is an intriguing group of guys!

Entire CD/LP ""HUMAN PERFORMANCE JUST GREAT!!  I really don't think their instrumentation is similar to anyone at all; I think they give a distinctive, very unique ""human performance"" musically!!!",1466035200,5
79022,14708,17778,"This album came out during my junior year in college. Van Morrison was at his peak. The performances, rightly regarded as classic, were well regarded, but the recorded sound and production on the original vinyl album was not. While the ""Caledonia Soul Orchestra"" was a great unit, their sound was not well captured. This new remastered release belatedly corrects that situation.

While I still miss the full sound of David Hayes' bass, it is far more prominent than before. More importantly perhaps, Van is right up front. Another reviewer suggested that if you turn it up, you'll feel as if you are right at the show - and that is true, particularly with a fine sound system. Just be prepared to turn the bass up a bit more than usual.

These two discs capture Van The Man at his creative, musical, and performing peak. Not an easy thing to do - in 1973, 2003, or even 2013. Van and the band really s-w-i-n-g on these tunes - this is not merely a run through of the standards/hits from his big early 70s albums. Everyone's clearly having fun. Even Morrison himself. Everything sounds fresh and newly written. If These Dream Of You doesn't get you up and rockin' around your living room I don't know what will. Celtic soul indeed. Help Me.

How good is this set? So good, I've just ordered the complementary set (Vol. II, III and IV).

79083,3315,17785,"I bought this at the local Barnes & Noble, and I have no complaints about the 4 CD set. As it happens, I'm not the biggest McCartney fanatic in the world, although I do think he is a phenomenal singer and songwriter (though he should stay away from the classical concert hall, except to attend performances), and also one of the finest rock bassists of his generation, and I do have most of his early solo stuff (up thru, say, 1978), in their deluxe editions where the latter exist.

And the simple fact is, I didn't have much of his post-1985 stuff (one or two of the experimental albums he's done, and they're fine), so this set tied up quite a few loose ends. And unlike the perfectionists who love to whine about anything that isn't just so, I'm not worried too much if a single edit is here in place of a full-length album cut -- it won't make me lose sleep over it in frustration. The sound is great, production notes are detailed just right, and the pictures are fine, for those who care about packaging, and the whole deal is also nice and compact (a virtue that is absent from the super-deluxe editions of his key albums). I've been listening to it all day, and there's not a clinker in the bunch among the songs I didn't know -- and certainly the ones I already knew are just fine!

People will always find something to gripe about. Van Halen S/T album is one of the greatest albums in rock history at 35:00 so... Kiss Love Gun 33 minutes.... Many other examples.

Update:

Been spinning this one a lot as of late. The record came with a download card and this has not only become my go-to driving music, but seeing heavy rotation on the treadmill to get me inspired in the morning.

I cannot imagine that anyone will not find a song that is omitted or wonder why another was included.

The album is a continuation in a sense the wonderful ""The Bright Mississippi"". It is an album full of melancholy and emotion. After his title ""American tunes"" a gem of other times hidden, another way of understanding music, sounds belonging to that wonderful city that is New Orleans. It is a very classic and evocative album. Today you can not understand this city without their music. Arranger, composer and musician who distills New Orleans from every pore. It is difficult to explain all these feelings and all the experience behind her notes, HOWEVER Joe Henry has done it. Beautiful themes, emotional voices and musicians first, Bill Frisell, Van Dyke Parks, Charles LLoyd ... but especially his piano. Always on the front line of sound, always evocative ... The man who got love Costello, The Band ... and many others. There are issues of Allen piano solo, intrumentales issues and sung, but always exciting and splendid. New Orleans always background, always with magnificent arrangements, always with class and simplicity already lost. An eternal CD that transports us to another place to other feelings.

79116,18,4175,"I recently saw Elle King in concert for the first time (more on that later). I admit that I really didn't know all that much about her before I saw her live show. Of course I had heard ""Ex's & Oh's"", a great single, reminding me of Adele, never a bad thing. It is the big hit of this, Elle King's debut album (released last year).

""Love Stuff"" (12 tracks; 42 min.) opens with the wickedly funny ""Where the Devile Don't Go"", which is followed by the hit single ""Ex's & Oh's"". ""Under the Influence"" continues the pop-smart sounds. ""Last Damn Night"" is an outright rocker, yes! Side A closer ""Song of Sorrow"" does not sound sorrowful at all. Side B opens with the other hit, ""America's Sweetheart"", another highlight on the album. The off-center ""I Told You I Was Mean"" reminds me of Amy Winehouse to an extent, but the lyrics are Elle King through and through (the song opens with ""I lied to you/I never cried for you/I swear that I tried to/But I had better things to do"", and that's just for starters... wow). ""Jackson"" is another hard-charging rocker. The album closes with the only introspective tune on here, ""See You Again"", just Elle and her acoustic guitar. What a way to finish things off!

I recently saw Elle in concert at the rapidly growing Bunbury Music Festival here in Cincinnati. She played an early evening set before a massive crowd, obviously playing mostly from this album, but surprisingly not ""America's Sweetheart"". But it's a minor quibble. Her set was simply amazing. Elle switched from guitar to banjo back to guitar, and live is sounds a lot less ""pop"" than on the album and a whole lot more rough and down to earth. Elle reminded the crowd that she hails from Ohio originally (albeit the eastern portion), and the crowd roared in approval. If you have a chance to see her in concert, do not miss her! Meanwhile, ""Love Stuff"" is a strong debut album for sure.",1466035200,4

79158,2402,17778,"The original Volume 1 of It's Too Late to Stop Now was first released in 1974 and showcases the best moments distilled from three live performances on Van's 1973 world tour: at The Troubadour in LA, the Santa Monica Civic and the great and much-missed Rainbow Theatre in Finsbury Park, London (which, alas, is no more). Many make a convincing case that this is the greatest live-performance album of all time, by any artist.

Van has always been a multi-talented writer, producer and arranger and this tour featured his Caledonia Soul Orchestra with string and brass sections complementing the rock music instrumental backing line-up to highlight every mood change during the gig: brass for the full-on rock/soul numbers, strings to fill out the more atmospheric pieces, and the whole held together by Van's unique, powerful and insistent vocal. The result by any logic shouldn't even work, but Van's extraordinary genius for synthesising different styles into his own trademark sound makes for a one-off, an all-time great. Even if you're not a committed Van Morrison fan, listen and you'll understand why he inspires such respect and has such a loyal fan base. From the explosive opener When you got a heartache youll just be overtaken by the irresistible urge to jump to your feet and dance  even if you're driving, which can be a problem!

I saw this line-up live at the very first Knebworth One-Day Festival on a hot summer Saturday in 1974 (I was very young and it was my first ever outdoor concert), and have never forgotten Van belting out those powerful, soulful vocals into the summer afternoon sunshine backed by a band so tight, so seamlessly unified yet infinitely flexible and responsive they were one beautiful organic whole, to treat the listener to a truly awesome, unforgettable experience. Since that day, I have been a die-hard Van Morrison fan.

The 18 numbers performed on this album are the best of the best, performed by one of the world's great musical artists in his prime, still with the power and restlessness of youth in his soul but with enough experience and maturity to understand the complexities of sound and instrumentation mix and the discipline necessary to pull it together and make it work. The power of Van's vocal delivery and his ability for on-the-spot improvisation to go with the mood of the moment often belie the committed professionalism of execution, the attention to minor details behind the performance. It's masterful.

This album is a true classic. It's outstanding; it has soul. Whichever of the various releases over the years you listen to (it doesn't really matter), just listen to it. Then buy the 2016-released package containing volumes 2, 3 & 4.",1466121600,5

79168,634,17909,"Prime Cuts: Back to Bethel, Come to My Rescue, Bring You Glory

Longevity gets a new definition with the McKameys.  While many artists would be content if they could rank up a dozen albums under their belt over the course of their careers, ""Something Worth Saving"" is the McKameys' 52nd album!  And they have been signed to Horizon Records ever since 1992.  Such a fleet is unheard of in these days of fledging loyalties.  Not only are the McKameys consistently scoring one radio hit after another, they are also touring at least a 150 dates a year, an accomplishment many of their peers would only admire.  Showing no sign of slowing down, they have deliver yet another stunning album of 10 newly recorded songs.

Before we delve into an exposition of these songs, it's fair first to say a word first about the McKameys.  It all started way back in 1954 in the home of a Christian minister where three of his daughters decided to sing in church one Sunday.  Dora, Peg and Carol McKamey not only caused a stir in their home church, but soon they were attracting the attention of out of town evangelists.  They began singing at revivals which really got the ball rolling.  Despite several configurations in the group's makeup over the years, the McKameys became a tour de force in Southern Gospel music over last six decades.

Surfacing out of listening to ""Something Worth Saving"" is secret to the longevity of the McKameys.  Over the course of these 10 songs, this Southern Gospel group shows consistency and impeccability in their song choices.  Rather than riding on the coat tails of fading trends, this McKameys release is rifled with songs of great tunes married with Gospel-centered lyrics. Lead single ""That's Why There's a Cross,"" one of three Sheryl Ferris' compositions, is exemplary of what a classic Southern Gospel tune need to sound like.  Majoring in the Cross-work of Jesus over a gorgeous country tune quipped with those deliciously sounding harmonies, ""That's Why There's a Cross"" has the word ""classic"" stamped all over it.

More Gospel moments abound with ""Come to My Rescue.""  Sung with an earnest brokenness, ""Come to My Rescue"" is a heartfelt and humble cry to God for his mercy and forgiveness. ""Bring You Glory"" continues the McKameys' balladry tradition of thoughtful singing over a slow waltzy tune. Arguably one of the best songs on the doctrine of perseverance is ""Back to Bethel"" which also has an old fashioned country charm to it that is extremely heart-warming. The title cut ""Something Worth Saving,"" on the other hand, takes on a more rootsy approach with some prominent sounding guitar riffs that may be a tad intrusive.

Despite the lofty quality of the songs and the McKameys' signature takes on them, the album leans towards the predictable side.  ""Something Worth Saving"" doesn't demonstrate much risk on the part of the team to tackle a more ""modern"" sound or to branch off into more adventurous musical terrains.  Nevertheless, as far as solid tunes go, you can't go wrong with ""Something Worth Saving.""",1466121600,5

79192,4505,17913,"Let me preface this by saying that as a general rule I hate kids' music. I don't mean songs kids sing in school and such. I mean professionally recorded music made for kids. Usually it's really annoying and I just refuse to play a studio recording of The Wheels On The Bus when we're driving in the car. I figure the Beatles were good enough for me when I was 6, so they are good enough for my kids.

That being said, Recess Monkey is alright! They are not obnoxious at all. Their music sounds cool. It's still obviously kids' music, but the band can play. They have a groovy sound. (Yeah I said groovy. What of it?)

The lyrics are fun and more importantly funny. They are all about simple subjects that we can all relate to, even if only nostalgically. Show And Tell is a great example. It's a song about show and tell at school. Simple as that. Remember show and tell back in the day? When you got to bring a favorite toy from home and bring it to school, connecting your two worlds? It was awesome! This is a song about it. It's fun.

I haven't enjoyed, or tolerated, an album made for kids this much since They Might Be Giants released their ""Here Comes Science"" album.

So as opposed as I am to kids' music in general....and as much as I think we should stage a modern day Disco Demolition Night like the White Sox did 30 years ago but only for Kidz Bop CD's....this album is cool and I will play this in the car with my kids.",1466121600,5

Not as much guitar scratching, some good harmonious parts, some breakout heaviness and shorter songs. A different release for sure than prior stuff. Vocally for sure. most is much cleaner.
They always had hit or miss tracks, but the HIT tracks were really strong. Here there is a lot of consistently good stuff, yet nothing extremely mind blowing.

Not to say this isn't a great listen and certainly not a time consuming one, but hardly a game changer as some reviews describe. Merely evolution for a band trying to get to the next level. Makes sense.
But it hits its mark in most spots, just seems to have a slight amount of filler for such a short listen. The mind blowing parts don't totally make up for the soft spots in my opinion. That is strictly my opinion. But its definitely worth a purchase.

A must buy regardless of minor flaws. Just not a 5. Good growth for a great band though. Spend the $10",1466121600,4

Pearl Jam grab their gungo ho grooves by the neck and shake their sound system on the 10 track, 44 minute Self Pollution Radio 1995 CD that is now available via Gold Fish. Eddie Vedder leads from the front on this Seattle, WA, FM Broadcast and as per usual the Jam is one of a noted jewel and that is of course Pearl.
Pearl Jam played this set on a noted evening where a host of other icons also appeared. However, Vedder and his troops are the focus here and their current album of the day Vitalogy forms the core of this recording with other numbers being lifted from the Ten and Vs releases. The session also features drummer Jack Irons who had  recently replaced Dave Abbruzzese.
This recording is an important historical document in the Pearl Jam story and the band plays as though their very lives depended on it. Pearl Jam are live and loud, passionate and proud-and, the 90s were certainly a high point in their career. This offering does justice to their reputation and is a magic carpet ride in to eye of an American aural assault that created a new face for musical momentum! The amazing fact is all of this fire was laid down in the home of Eddie but that does not mean that any corners were cut. If you want to lunge for grunge or take stock of rock this US bounty of bombast is the required prescription to satisfy your sonic health.",1466121600,5

79203,1620,17917,"Is it really the end for Nathan Drake?  Henry Jackman's score for ""A Thief's End"" certainly seems to say so.  It's certainly an elegant, moving and somewhat bittersweet sound for the series that has certainly helped to restore my confidence in Jackman's abilities.  Having some mixed feelings concerning some of Jackman's previous efforts and the fact that Greg Edmonson wasn't returning had me a little concerned for the music behind Drake's latest adventure.  The Uncharted series is the reason why I ended up purchasing a PS3 and this latest adventure will certainly be the motivation for eventually picking up a PS4.  The gameplay, story, and the music has always been top notch for these games so when this soundtrack arrived, I couldn't tear open the wrapper fast enough.

Jackman's opening track, ""A Thief's End"", starts the score off wonderfully as it brings us back to the mystery and adventures of Nathan Drake.  While not as dynamic or robust as a ""Nate's Theme 4.0"", it does give way to storytelling approach that signals ""one final adventure"".  Jackman pays homage to Edmonson's Nate theme in a special way with a variation that slowly builds into the familiar tune and I must say that he handles it very well giving fans of the series something familiar to hold onto.  You can only smile once it reaches it's full grandeur and Jackman references the theme in other pieces like ""Brother's Keeper"" (track 22).  Other tracks where you'll hear the Nathan Drake theme through variations are tracks 5, 16, 22, 23, and 24.

While some reference points to Edmonson's work is present, the score is essentially Jackman's and he does a wonderful job of producing music that  fits right in with the series and what we'd expect to accompany a story concerning Nathan Drake.  The first action track, ""Cut to the Chase"" (track 4), has a large orchestra pounding out some great thematic music that is easy to hum along with and tattoos itself instead your head.  It's not all just about the action music however.  There are some great adventurous exploration music here too.  Jackman spins out some carefully crafted tunes as if you are searching in dark caverns or forgotten places and finding a long forgotten secret.  ""The Grave of Henry Avery"" (track 7) is an example of one of these pieces that does a great job of creating this ambience that I am sure is very effective while playing the game and getting involved with the story.  The score bounces back and forth between these story building moments and more dynamic action pieces just like every good adventure should.  The hard thing about developing these action sequences is avoiding the problem of just creating action noise.  Jackman does an excellent job here with developing great pieces that have nervous and agitated violins supporting the big brass who are essentially pushing out a heroic theme that works really well in keeping everything entertaining for the ears and imagination.  ""The Twelve Towers"" (track 9) is a great example of this and one that I really enjoy.

""One Last Time"" (track 23) is an interesting cue that has a few different movements in it and must be a pivotal point within the story.  It begins with a very ominous tone that moves into a heroic romp that is suddenly cut short with a shift into a sad yet mysterious echoey piano.  It's a great piece and has me wondering what is happening here?  The score closes with ""Epilogue"" (track 24), that is a very fitting as a bookend to this story.  It's somewhat sad as there is a bit of finality to everything but it ends a bit abruptly and within that I'll store my hope that we might see Nathan Drake again on the PS8 or something.

La-La Land Records again provides fans with a limited edition (3000 copies) release of the CD for fans.  While not a double disk like their previous releases for the Uncharted series, they have provided a great soundtrack with 24 tracks with a running time of 1 hour and 11 minutes.  The CD comes with a 12 page insert with a note from the composer, a note from Neil Druckmann (writer and creative director), photos from the game, and production credits.  Rest assured, Jackman has done a great job with this score.  He's kept it connected to the series but has managed to put his own creative spin on things as well.  While there is plenty of great adventurous action music, Jackman also crafts some elegant exploration and even emotional music as well.  I recommend!",1466121600,5

79206,1726,17918,"Alison Lewis was described by Cabaret Scenes as ""a singer with a hauntingly beautiful voice who transformed the ordinary into the extraordinary with brilliant arrangements and vocal experimentation."" No stranger to stages large and small, Alison has performed in venues ranging from intimate clubs in Europe and the United States to the Skirball Museum in Los Angeles and Lincoln Center in New York. She spent years touring with the six-woman world a cappella group, Vocolot, as well as singing lead with San Franciscos Glide Memorial Gospel Choir, several major cover bands, R&B acts and jazz ensembles at high profile events throughout California.

Alison has additionally dedicated a large portion of her life to human service projects, both locally and abroad. Much of her artistic inspiration, in fact, stems from some of her unforgettable moments in India, Honduras, and beyond. In 2009, Alison relocated from San Francisco to Los Angeles and launched her solo jazz show, At Liberty, to much acclaim. She continues to perform live at various clubs, concert halls and houses of worship, and provides session vocals for a number of independent artists, film and video game composers. Her voice is best described as possessing a wonderful combination of purity, richness, warmth, earthiness, and soul.

The ensemble is Alison Lewis: vocals, Mitchel Forman: piano, Fender Rhodes, Hammond B3 Organ, Kevin Axt: bass, Ray Brinker: drums and hand percussion, Andrew Synowiec: lap steel and acoustic guitars, Eddie Reyes: cajon and udu, Adam Shulman: piano, Paul Eastburn: bass, Ricky Carter: drums, Jude Gold: acoustic guitar, Anne King: muted trumpet.

The tracks are as follows:

79245,4297,17914,"Gojira returns with a masterful album that sees them taking steps forward without making any jarring stylistic changes. Magma's melancholic atmosphere coincides with the loss of Joe and Mario Duplantier's mother, who sadly passed away as they worked on the album. Even in the heaviest tracks, you can feel an innate sadness that serves as both mourning and tribute. It's therefore not surprising that what may be their softest, and incidentally most accessible, song to date, The Shooting Star, leads off the album and sets the tone right away. Lest longtime fans fear a new direction, the gears quickly shift into far heavier territory for the next several songs, and really the entire core of the album. While these songs, by the band's own admission, involve less complexity than what might be typically expected of them, I found myself over and over either banging my head along with the tracks or shaking it in wonder at some ridiculously unconventional moments of metal oddity. The back-to-back freakiness of The Cell and Stranded (tracks 3 and 4) might best exemplify what I'm talking about. Both songs recall the glories of albums past, but infuse more atmosphere in the guitar melodies and increased use of clean vocals. This band has shown growth throughout each chapter of their career, and that continues here, as seen in the title track, which combines Swans-like vocals, quirky, otherworldy guitar noises, subdued but signature riffs, and a crushing riff in the midsection. The album is regretfully short, as only eight of the ten songs are full tracks. Yellowstone and Liberation are both spare instrumentals that I could honestly take or leave, but I'm sure some will find that they add dynamics to the overall listen. Before the closing Liberation, Magma rolls toward the finish with a triad of heavy, but atmospheric, songs that finish off an extremely strong album. Gojira once again impressively represents a newer generation of metal that needs more obvious champions as the legendary acts from the '80's and '90's begin to wind down their careers. This band should be at the top of the game in the next decade or more going forward.",1466121600,5

79264,56,1523,"There is no question that so many of today's divas are really more like trashy pop tarts, than really showing what the voice is suppose to be from the inside. But honestly, so many of those simply legendary divas have either retired, stopped making music, or just passed away. That has been the case with so many pop divas from Whitney Houston, or Tammy Wynette. And there have been some divas that have never gotten the credit they rightfully deserve. Phyllis Hyman was one of those divas. Hard to believe that it has been over twenty years since she tragically committed suicide and just left behind a mark that was never given the commercial success that acts like Patti LaBelle or Aretha Franklin have garnished. When I think of what Phyllis had as a singer, I think of so many of her brilliant songs, and Living All Alone is one of them. It is just a soaring ballad that speaks so well from the soul that is haunting and beautiful. Phyllis had sung so soulfully, that she really could have been able to move mountains, but no river was cast over stone for the populace. I would say many of today's divas that have no voice or soul whatsoever like Beyonce' Knowles, Rihanna or Ariana Grande could learn a thing from what Phyllis had recorded over the years. This is a great song, and a beautiful download for new and die hard fans of the great Phyllis Hyman.

79281,12631,8127,"In April 1964 veteran R&B impresarios George Goldner, Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller teamed up with the multi-talented producer/songwriting team of Jeff Barry and Ellie Greenwich and launched Red Bird Records in New York City. This was a match made in heaven. Over the next several years the Red Bird label would release some of the most exciting pop records ever recorded. And while it wasn't really planned that way nearly 90% of the labels successful releases were by female groups or solo artists. One of the most interesting and innovative tunes to be released by Red Bird was The Dixie Cups classic recording of the Mardi Gras favorite ""Iko Iko"". The song, under the original title ""Jock-A-Mo"", was written and released as a single in 1953 by Sugar Boy and his Cane Cutters but failed to make the charts. There are as many guesses about the meaning of this song as there are versions of it. So why not forget about all that and just enjoy the original hit recording of this fabulous tune?",1466208000,5

79307,1665,17931,"Sarah Jarosz is a class act.  She's a fine musician, an excellent songwriter and a very good singer, all of which are in evidence here.

I thought her last album, Build Me Up From Bones was one of the best of 2013.  Undercurrent (quite an apt title, I think) is rather different in character  quieter and more contemplative overall, with several tracks featuring Sarah Jarosz playing and singing solo.  It takes a bit of getting into, I found, because it doesnt always have the immediacy of, say, Over The Edge or Gone Too Soon, but after half-a-dozen listens, I'm hooked.  These songs are beautifully crafted musically, and often have very good lyrics.  They are personal and varied, with tender celebrations of love, harsh break-up songs (the excellent House Of Mercy) and yearning hints at reconciliation in the lovely, haunting Lost Dog.  There are some excellent collaborations, including with Aiofe O'Donovan on Still Life (returning Sarah's appearance on Aiofe's fine album Magic Hour). Production is restrained but spot on for these songs, I think, allowing each one to speak as it should and the more I listen to this album, the better I like it.

I saw Sarah Jarosz live at London's Bush Hall a couple of years ago.  She was brilliant, performing superbly, making it look effortless and plainly putting everything into the music.  You can't fake that sort of quality, and Undercurrent is a worthy next step.  It's an album of real quality and it's a great listen.  Very warmly recommended.",1466208000,5

79316,7220,17862,"Thankfully I read other customer reviews before I got this. The explicit version came out June 17th, and it was so worth the wait. Juicy J does music about drinking, smoking, and f'ing better than anyone else, and this is exactly what I wanted to hear from both Juicy J and Wiz. TM88 came with some fire beats, and Juicy & Wiz did these beats justice. Cell Ready,I See It I Want It, She In Love, Luxury Flow, and, Hit Me Up are my favorites, but the whole album goooooes off. It is funny noticing that Juicy J does nearly every hook, every ad-lib, leads off on the songs, and has 2 verses on every song while Wiz has one, with exceptions being Luxury Flow (Juicy J solo), and Cell Ready, which is both of them rapping back and forth like Styles P and Jadakiss. This is a must have for both long time and newer fans of both artists. If you liked Rubba Band Business 1 & 2, Stay Trippy, and 2 of the Cabin Fever tapes, you will most surely enjoy this.",1466208000,4

79327,9766,17932,"Local Texan rumba flamenco guitarist Russ Hewitt impressed us with his recording debut Bajo El Sol eight years ago and has been patience and particular with his steps since. Waiting three years to record his equally strong follow up Alma Vieja Hewitt avoided the sophomore slump and now it has been over 5 years for him to finally release his latest recording Cielo Nocturno. Keeping a creative streak is a difficult task for even the best of musicians and streaks are made to be broken. Clearly this is the case with Cielo Nocturno which is not of equal strength of his prior recordings but frankly exceeds all expectations from this artist that grows in his compositional capabilities.

Cielo Nocturno presides with perhaps one of Hewitts most impressionable composition to date with the exhilarating Presidio. He has no hesitation seeking  assistance from his friends in high places as the track also features Ardeshir Farah from Strunz & Farah who is also featured later on the more progressive and chaotic Persian Sky. Even more impressive is orchestrating the appearance of Larry Carlton on the sublime North Of Home which is already getting much attention from several different playlists.

However, Russs latest creation is not about impressing you with the company he keeps but introducing you to his most melodic immediate recording to date without any sign of a commercial sellout. Check out the wandering 40 second introduction that then breaks out into a gorgeous melodic chorus found on Arenas Blancas. Hewitt and his usual band of suspects flow effortlessly with no superstar present followed up by the percussive driven Cervezas And Cigars. Add in a little attitude from an accordion this song essentially transports you to an exotic cyber Cuban bar where the the smell of Havana cigars lingers in the air. Equally up to the task is the bossa nova influences found on playful breezy optimistic Um Abraco Do Bossa.

Hewitt has never disappointed and despite his impressive prior recordings Cielo Nocturno has truly set the bar even higher of what this unique Texan guitarist can do. Without out a doubt there is nothing but immediate high quality tracks that are impressive on its very first listen making Cielo Nocturno the most melodic appealing album to date with absolutely no diminishing originality. Good luck Russ outdoing yourself after this one!!!",1466208000,5

79344,12631,7193,"If you did not grow up in the 1960's you just might wonder why so many baby boomers continue to be fixated on the music of that decade. The Billboard charts were filled with so many new and exciting sounds. When one thinks of 60's music the British Invasion and Motown immediately come to mind. But there were a number of other sounds that made an impact in the 1960's as well. Sergio Mendes brought his unique blend of Brazilian, jazz and American pop styles to America for the first time in 1966. His music was an instant sensation. Although Sergio Mendes himself did not sing, he was the pianist, arranger, producer and musical director of this unique group. Led by vocalist Lani Hall, Sergio Mendes and Brasil '66 would produce some of the most innovative sounds of the late 60's. The group's second major hit in the USA was a remake of a Lennon-McCartney tune from The Beatles ""Magical Mystery Tour"" album released less than six months earlier. Sergio Mendes re-imagined ""The Fool On the Hill"" and recorded it in his own inimitable style. The record buying public loved it as it spent 12 weeks on the charts and peaked at #6. Yet another great record for the group from South America.",1466208000,5

I'm glad she got to break from the chains of record labels to be able to make the music she wants to make without being forced to change it and make it true pop music as they did with Wild Child.

I have been a fan of Juliet since the Automatic Loveletter days and I can truly see how much she has changed over the years. You'll never find someone as talented as Juliet. She never fails me with her amazing voice!
I have seen where people says this is auto tuned when it's clearly not. You can just hear how real and emotional this record is. Not to mention she has said that she doesn't want to use auto tune because it takes away the specialness of the music you're making.
This record is true, powerful, emotional, and beautiful. I highly recommend this EP along with all of Juliet's other music. Also be on the lookout for her next new EP ""From The Grave"" that's coming out July 15, 2016!!",1466208000,5

As a reigning teen idol Bobby's face was plastered all over the teen magazines and his records were selling like hotcakes. Then in 1964 the phenomenon known as the British Invasion caught everyone by surprise and suddenly stars like Bobby Rydell, Gene Pitney, Roy Orbison and so many others were cast aside. Times had changed and youngsters in the mid sixties were movin' and groovin' to new and different sounds. At about that same time Bobby learned that his longtime record label Cameo-Parkway had been sold and was moving its operations out of his native Philadelphia. His last big hit record for Cameo was 1963's ""Forget Him"" which peaked at #4 on the Billboard Hot 100. Sadly, Bobby Rydell would never have another hit record again.",1466294400,5

79449,56,5302,"There are just so few singers that today have been timeless because of the sophistication of the voice alone. Hard to believe that so many of them from Soul & R&B music have passed on too young. Unfortunately, it has been over a decade since Luther Vandross tragically passed away, and so far no one has been able to really shine based on the sophistication of the voice alone. There has never been a soulful singer from today's music that has not even been able to scratch the surface from the soulful voice Luther Vandross left behind when he passed away from complications of a severe stroke he suffered in 2005. One of Luther's last songs Dance With My Father is definitely a brilliant classic that still shows a whole lot of heart for a father whom passed on when a child is too young, and all he prays like his mom is to see the light from his deceased parent's eyes again. It is just one of those deep songs I will always think of Luther Vandross for, because Luther really gave his heart on this song. If you have never even heard a Luther Vandross song before, this is sincerely one to recommend going to.

They always put out good music and over the years some of their cds like Have Arrived, Together, Step On Out, American Made, Colors and Front Row Seats are some of my favorite cds.  This cd is through Cracker Barrel.  I used to go to Cracker Barrel some but most of the friends that I went with are gone now so I don't go there too much anymore.  So this was kind of a hard cd for me to get.  I don't remember where I got it and it was over priced.  Something like 40 dollars.  But I don't care.  I wanted it.
The cd has some new songs like What 'cha Gonna do and BEore I Die, and a very good song Louisiana Red Dirt Highway.  And its got re recorded versions of songs like True Heart, Lucky Moon,Gonna Take A Lot Of River and Elvira.  Like everything else this is a good cd",1466294400,3

79464,12631,4950,"In the four year period between 1960 thru 1963 Bobby Rydell was pretty hot stuff. As a reigning teen idol Bobby's face was plastered all over the teen magazines and his records were selling like hotcakes. Then in 1964 the phenomenon known as the British Invasion caught everyone by surprise and suddenly stars like Bobby Rydell, Gene Pitney, Roy Orbison and so many others were cast aside. Times had changed and youngsters in the mid sixties were movin' and groovin' to new and different sounds. At about that same time Bobby learned that his longtime record label Cameo-Parkway had been sold and was moving its operations out of his native Philadelphia. His last big hit record for Cameo was 1963's ""Forget Him"" which peaked at #4 on the Billboard Hot 100. Sadly, Bobby Rydell would never have another hit record again.",1466294400,5

Radiohead music is kind of in a class by itself.  You either like it or you don't. I enjoy this new music and would highly recommend it to any true Radiohead fan. Check out the video for Day Dreaming on You Tube.  It is really a unique viewing experience.

79541,10607,17962,"Out of print for many years, this album came from the split of the Bee Gees in 1969. Despite poor album sales the single `Saved By The Bell' went to #2 on the UK pop charts. It's an interesting and sometimes perplexing array of songs. Robin Gibb once mentioned that he felt the album was unfinished and that is noted. Pop historians have regarded this as a unique dive into baroque pop of its own kind. Although `One Million Years' and `August October' were also released as singles, the album is a hodgepodge of creativity. `Lord Bless All' is an overly overdubbed chorus, `Farmer Ferdinand Hudson' is a garbled mix of unintelligible lyrics and `The Worst Girl In This Town' is simply bewildering. However, some songs are simply pop gems like, `Give Me A Smile' and `Most Of My Life' with the classic Bee Gees orchestration for mood and backup. The use of horns is nicely done. There was to be another solo album called, ""Sing Slowly Sisters"" to follow, but the reunion of the Bee Gees placed that on the ""lost albums"" list. If you like Robin and his warbling voice, you'll enjoy this album. But don't forget that it was he who said he felt it was unfinished. Regardless, it is a piece of pop history.",1466380800,4

However, I like this combined effort very much. There's all the songwriting skill and musical excellence they have shown individually, and this time it really speaks to me.

The sound is generally harmonic, rich and atmospheric without being over-produced. It's also quite varied in style, which I like a lot. To choose a few tracks almost at random, Delirium sounds something like a cross between Pentangle and The Mamas & The Papas, and the 60s are often close at hand with an almost psychedelic feel in places. 1000 Miles Away is more jazzy and Sade-like, Supermoon has the feel of contemporary Americana from largely acoustic singer-songwriter and Why Do We Fight reminded me strongly of The Carpenters  which is just fine by me.

I'm enjoying this album very much (and far more than I expected to). It's thoughtful, beautifully crafted and very listenable and I can recommend this warmly.",1466380800,5

This is the first original Dark Adventure Radio Theatre program, and when combined with all the great old-time radio program touches that make all the HPLHS DART programs a delight to listen to, the result is superb.

79586,56,4663,"Hard to believe it, that singers of today have been more like jokes than the soul from the heart of the inside. But honestly, there are some singers from years ago that really have not been able to be ageless, and their songs have shown that they are never sounding tired or annoying as products, but soulful people. Sting is one of those singers that has shown to be completely ageless. When he was a part of The Police, he had some great songs with the group. But since he started his solo career on his own in the 80's, he has still shown brilliant growth in his songwriting. I think that is why his songs have never gotten out of date, they have instead been better with age like a fine glass of wine. One of my favorite songs of his from Nothing Like The Sun is fragile. The song is so intimate from the soul and sincerely cathartic at the guitar chords. It is one of those songs that has not been beautiful, but sincerely deep at the heart. I love how simple and beautiful the song is, and all this time never gotten old. This song is worth downloading from start to finish, from a fragile and beautiful soul.

79589,12631,5224,"Imagine learning when you are a young child that you are only expected to live until age 30. This was the reality Bobby Darin was forced to cope with. Even in his early teens Bobby Darin knew just what he wanted to do with his life. He craved the spotlight and realized early on that music was in his blood. Not only did he love to sing and perform before live audiences but he was also an extremely gifted songwriter and a talented musician as well. And because of his serious medical condition he was determined to make a name for himself before the age of 25. Well lo and behold Bobby Darin did just that!! In the decade between 1958 and 1968 he churned out more than 40 singles. Several were major hits including his signature tune ""Mack The Knife"". Perhaps my favorite Darin recording is his big 1960 hit ""Beyond The Sea"". This was the stuff of night clubs and Broadway shows. Audiences loved it and the record zoomed to #6 on the national charts. Don't hear this much on the radio anymore but when I do I crank up the sound!",1466380800,5

79618,898,17516,I confess that Im going to have to look up the meaning of Dark Necessities by Red Hot Chili Peppers this week to figure out the meaning despite enjoying the song after recently hearing it on local radio and then also listening to it online. This version combines alternative rock with a slight bar lounge/jazz type of vibe with definite music experimentation on their part. A good way to determine if you might like this song is to listen to Higher Ground also by Red Hot Chili Peppers (due to Dark Necessities being a brilliant gem that channels the well done music experimentation of Higher Ground).,1466467200,5

79639,5843,17914,"I can't help but feel that Magma is one of their weaker albums, it's very average on the whole. And this is just in terms of the album as a stand alone work. It would be a bit unfair to compare it to their old material, even though I love those early albums. They brought some different sounds to the album overall but it's certainly toned down in terms of heaviness and technicality. And where as the previous album had strong tracks all around, Magma only has a few. Silvera is a highlight because it gives the album a much needed punch and succeeds in being hooky while also maintaining a fair bit of heaviness. Pray is a good representation of the atmospheric tone of this album, it's a good, haunting, and well crafted track. After that it gets a little bare bones in terms of highlights. Shooting Star, The Cell, Stranded, and Magma are all mildly decent songs, however they mostly kind of plod along and don't really go anywhere, save for the end of Stranded. I'm not seeing anything that great about any of them. And then there's Only Pain and Low Lands which I find forgettable and uninteresting. Yellow Stone and Liberation are short instrumentals that feel like tacked on ideas instead of fully composed pieces.

I'm really not agreeing with the critical acclaim and rave reviews Magma has received. I guess I could say that at best it's an average diversion for the typical Gojira fan, or maybe it's just me not being able to really connect with the material. It's a very subjective review because if you're an older fan this simply might not do it for you. And on the other hand if you like the direction they've been heading in, you might love it. Either way though for me it's an underwhelming album that I don't really swing one way or the other with. It's not bad by any means, theres a couple pretty good songs here but I'm not feeling it as a whole. And it's actually kind of repetitive and lackluster. I think 3 stars out of 5 is a fair score for Magma.",1466467200,3

I have also heard a version by Tom Jones before on one of his greatest hits collection. Around 2015,I then heard it on iheartradio and this version of Black Betty by Ram Jam grew on me after hearing it enough times on my personalized favorites radio station especially because of the guitars and the well timed lyrics with the music.

79686,1399,15321,"Singer Wendy Pedersen and pianist Jim Gasior have been longtime participants in the South Florida music scene, both graduates of Univ. of Miami music programs and each deserving of much wider exposure and recognition.  Pedersen is the consummate jazz vocalist, with finely nuanced phrasing, a swinging and adventurous rhythmic sensibility, and a charismatic delivery, while Gasior is a pianist of great technical facility and stylistic flexibility, as well as being a compelling soloist and a sensitive accompanist.  The combination of Pedersen and Gasior's substantial talents on this their first duet album result in what should be considered among the best jazz releases of 2016, as they artfully invigorate 14 standards (counting two medleys).

""The Late Late Show"" finds Gasior's affecting, striding accompaniment meshing perfectly with Pedersen's bluesy, pitch perfect exuberance, and the pianist's solo is a joyful nugget in the best classic jazz tradition.  Pedersen's reading of the lyrics to ""It Ain't Necessarily So"" toys knowingly with the rhythmic structure through her multicolored phrasing, with Gasior in solo and supporting roles displaying great harmonic sophistication and inventiveness.  The thought provoking medley of ""If I Should Lose You"" and ""If Ever I Would Leave You"" is stamped by Pedersen's plaintive / declarative vocals that possess an emotional authenticity, as Gasior's chords and fills ring true to her purposeful message.  Duke Ellington's ""Everything But You"" is given a sly tongue-in-cheek rendition by Pedersen, with Gasior's vibrant, loose-limbed Earl Hines-like assistance, plus his buoyantly upbeat improv.

Gasior channels composer Fats Waller's carefree striding style on ""Jitterbug Waltz,"" during which Pedersen evinces her trademark rhythmic agility and uninhibited, naturally flowing turns of phrase.  ""Besame Mucho"" receives a heartfelt and devastatingly moving interpretation, Pedersen's singing in Spanish and Gasior's rhapsodic piano complementing each other to a tee.  The clever juxtaposition of ""The Best Thing For You"" and ""Just You, Just Me"" is contained in a zestfully syncopated, succinct 2:47, two minds operating as one.  ""Meet Me At No Special Place"" proceeds along the lines of ""Everything But You,"" with an earthy Pedersen in high accord with a rollicking Gasior.

""'Round Midnight"" is gripping from the start, as Pedersen's expressively intoned, elastic voice and Gasior's sparse, chiming backdrop (and later disarming solo) draw you in for an absorbing journey of seven-plus minutes that never wears out its welcome.  ""My Favorite Things"" is taken in 11/8 tempo, which makes their duo vision of it even more fanciful than usual.  Unison wordless vocal and piano passages are transfixing and stirring, as is Gasior's sprightly statement.  ""Oh, What a Beautiful Morning"" emerges as reverent and endearing, a nourishing gospel-styled treatment, with both artists reaching the very pinnacle of eloquence.  The closing ""Exactly Like You"" features nimbly swinging Pedersen, with Gasior's comping an endlessly fluctuating stream of rhythmic patterns and / or motifs.",1466467200,5

79723,898,13964,I admit that I enjoy listening to the R3hab version of Wildest Dreams by Taylor Swift because I also like the original version of Wildest Dreams from Taylor Swifts 1989 (Deluxe version) compilation. This version of Wildest Dreams (R3hab Remix) by Taylor Swift combines both club and trance elements with the original pop/dance version. The song appears to be about meeting someone who is a dream come true and there is also a video available to go with the song that adds to the story imagery of this tune.,1466467200,5

The song was actually extremely popular by some of the people in my high school to the point that this song was actually played once before inside my high cafeteria  during what was either my junior or senior year of high school. I admit that I was drawn in because of the guitars and the well timed singing of this song. However, I did not figure out the meaning of the song until after I lived here in the Washington D.C. area (through online sources). I actually understand why our military (and our allies)have to continue be supported both politically and financially as well as trained yet this song still catches my attention because some of the lyrics ended up being prophetic.",1466467200,5

79763,898,2167,I have to definitely credit both VH1 and local radio as why I first heard this pleasant tune of Shes So High by Tal Bachman as a teenager during the 1990s. Im taking this upbeat 90s contemporary pop/coffeehouse rock song to be about being in a relationship with someone who has a beneficial influence on the other person.

I say over six years because I had first heard this song either when my husband and I were living in Mayport Naval Base Florida or Orlando Florida. I have also heard a version by Tom Jones before on one of his greatest hits collection. Around 2015,I then heard it on iheartradio and this version of Black Betty by Ram Jam grew on me after hearing it enough times on my personalized favorites radio station especially because of the guitars and the well timed lyrics with the music.

79794,56,16604,"There is so much going on with the great Phil Collins right now. Musically, he had been absent from making new music for quite awhile to deal with personal issues from having back surgery to take care of his own needs, after battling problems plagued all the way back to when he reunited to tour with Genesis in 2007. His catalog has also had a very strong makeover, being remastered and re-issued with new music, demos of classic hits and live material that sounds really strong today, like when it did years ago. His career has been really shining again, and his classic songs are also as well worth being rediscovered. I Don't Care Anymore, from his 1982 album Hello, I Must Be Going is a deep driven song from the beat of the drums, which also feels just as much angst and heartbreak from a ended relationship, just as strongly as In The Air Tonight had shown released the year before. It is definitely a song that is worth checking out, even if you had never heard the song the first time it came out years ago. This is a treat for die hard Phil Collins fans, and a good sample for newcomers.

I admit that I tried to look up the meaning of the song online but more or less got that it is a happy vibe type of song (from what I deduce on songfacts).

I'd heard Damn Yankees on the radio but didn't end up paying too much attention. Imagine my surprise when I walked into a record store in October of 1990 to see a brand new Styx album. I noticed that Tommy wasn't on it but pretty much everyone else was. Hey that's cool. They had great records before Tommy joined and I was sure that this one would be up to the usual standards. Unfortunately, that isn't the case. If you look at the photos of the individual band members, you'll notice that it's very much that leather hair band look of the '80's. That's pretty much what you get here. There are a few stand out songs here like Show Me The Way and Carrie Ann but most of the overall album just sounds sort of generic.",1466467200,3

The reviews of Baptist Town mentioned blues themes and were very favorable so I was tempted to try it. But what really coerced me into buying the CD was the cover and the name of the CD. The reviews were correct. There is a tinge of gospel to the CD but for the majority, it is what I call R&B (Rock & Blues). This is a very good CD if you enjoy such type of music.

79929,482,17222,"Cyndi Lauper's ""Detour"" has some great gems.  Her cover of the Wanda Jackson record ""Funnel of Love"" that opens the disc bounces joyfully with Cyndi's voice full of swagger as her band rocks, ""It's such a crazy crazy feeling, weak in the knees as my head goes reeling.""  I also warm to her covers of two tracks associated with Patsy Cline.  ""Walkin' After Midnight"" has been covered by so many singers from Wanda Jackson to Kellie Pickler to Loretta Lynn.  In Cyndi's hands it has a pulsing beat with Cyndi massaging the melody playfully, ""I walk for miles along the highway, that's just my way of saying 'I love you.'""  ""I Fall to Pieces"" has been recorded by so many including ex-Monkee Michael Nesmith, Linda Ronstadt, and yes, Loretta Lynn.  Cyndi goes a little deeper into her register to milk the sadness out of the vocals, ""You want me to act like we've never kissed; You want me to forget, pretend we've never met; And I've tried and I've tried, though I haven't yet.""  Other tracks like ""Misty Blue,"" ""Night Life"" in duet with its most famous singer and songwriter Willie Nelson, and the closer ""Hard Candy Christmas"" also charm.  While not every track here makes me jump for joy, there is enough to warrant strong listening and play.  Enjoy!",1466553600,4

79972,12631,9352,"Return with me now to the late 60's and early 70's when the Top 40 format was still king on AM radio. Most stations would kick off each hour with a driving uptempo tune. Enter The Grass Roots. As far as I'm concerned they were the personification of Top 40 radio. A great many people despised the so-called ""bubblegum"" music in those days. But this music was better than that. I never knew anyone who disliked The Grass Roots. Lead singer Rob Grilli and the gang simply made outstanding pop singles.  In August of 1968 Dunhill/ABC released ""Midnight Confessions"".  Peaking at #5 it would prove to be the group's biggest hit and best selling single.  Since there are a number of re-recordings out there you should know that this is the original hit single version you would remember from the radio.",1466553600,5

79987,9069,17628,"The advance single Wristband set the tone for Simons latest.  Laying out a funny tale of being locked out of his own performance venue, Simon extends the metaphor to an observation on economic justice.  Presented in his self-deprecating, wry manner, Wristband is classic Simon  except for the bubbling percussion bed undergirding the music.  In fact, half of Stranger is Graceland doubled-down.  Percussion  layered, looped, and even extending to the esoteric, 43-tones-per octave colors of avant-garde composer Harry Partchs cloud chamber bowls  drives half the tracks.  Kudos to Simon for trying a new foundation on which to build his poetic house, but the rhythmic clatter too often obscures his soft-spoken vocals and insightful lyrics.  The other, quieter half of Stranger is more intimate and more effective, highlighted by the title track and the gorgeous instrumental In the Garden of Edie (dedicated to wife Edie Brickell).  Stranger danger:  Cool Papa Bell zeros in with a discussion of the MF-bomb that comes off more like a sophomoric prank than a serious lyric, and clearly not one for the kiddies.  I give the man his due, but Stranger isn't as friendly as Id have liked.",1466553600,3

79998,56,17332,"It is so sad that someone young and talented has became more of a product, than a real songstress. Unfortunately for Beyonce' Knowles, she has been more of a product than a real singer. It is so sad because she hasn't even made music that spoke from the soul, and instead tried to pull out another surprise as a product, than the person on the inside. Her Lemonade album has been more like a joke than a stand. Sadly though, she has shown some real cracks unveiled in her personal life. I didn't find the song Formation to impress me at all, and it was more of a joke than a real stand. Sorry, her latest single from Lemonade really takes shots at the two men in her life, her estranged husband Jay-Z and her separated father Matthew Knowles, for cheating on her, and her mother Tina. I found the song to be very poor at soul and didn't impress me at all, and shows that Beyonce' Knowles still hasn't grown as a singer. Perhaps she should take a listen to Gwen Stefani and what she made as a album about being cheated on before hers came out. Sorry is a bust, and Beyonce' Knowles should consider retiring.

80031,12631,5842,"He was a powerful force on the Billboard charts for more than a quarter century. Over the years this dynamic artist would prove to be not only a spendid singer but a talented musician and gifted songwriter to boot. His records were a fixture on American radio through most of the 60's, 70's and 80's. Yes, Stevie Wonder truly was and remains an American original.  One of my all-time favorite Stevie Wonder tunes was his rollicking 1967 #2 hit ""I Was Made To Love Her"".  In my opinion this just might be his finest vocal performance ever while his harmonica work at the beginning of the record was simply outstanding.",1466640000,5

80051,5347,8416,"This album is excellent! Some people would categorize it as Trop- Rock but I believe that moniker is too much of a pigeon hole to encompass the work on this album. This is World/Rock music an a fantastic mesh that delivers satisfaction with each and every song. The first song, Mufasa Returns,  beckons sounds from Asia and the Middle-East and melts almost instantly into the title track, which is an opus onto itself mixing transcendental with Rock and Ska. Tarzan and Kalimba resonates with the sounds of Africa and Reggaeton. Diamond, is Western Reggae. A Little Distance is a Caribbean influenced island beach song with elements of late Police a la ""Ghost In The Machine"". These Dreams is the tune that most people would call Trop- Rock but the play out is purely influenced by Middle Eastern rhythms and transcendental music. The song, Easy and Cheap, is a pure rocker hands down. The song, Maybe, could be considered another opus on the album from its well crafted intro to the rocking climax. This is songwriting genius right here. The last tune on the album, If Ever You Should Fall, is a pop ballad with elements of early Billy Joel, Jimmy Buffett, Beatles, and Bee Gees all rolled into a beautiful tome from a parent to a child.
It is hard to find an album so well crafted and so well defined in the indie music world. Midnight Kahuna surpasses everyone with this phenomenal release.",1466640000,5

80053,6343,13126,"When I heard about Hamilton and that the music was very contemporary, i.e. Rap/Hip Hop I was completely turned off. American History in rap? Really? A confession: I am 71 so I am pretty much old school when it comes to Broadway musicals and the world of contemporary music left me in the 70s and 80s. Someone loaned me the soundtrack and I thought I'd listen to it just to shut them up but I wasn't expecting much. Boy was I wrong! This music is a masterpiece! I ran the gamut of emotions from laughing out loud to being in tears. ""Helpless"" had me singing and dancing and ""Burn"" had me in crying the first time I heard it. This is an emotional roller coaster but worth it. There are so many songs to love that I won't list them all but I know that this is a CD that I will listen to over and over. I am embarrassed to say that quite a bit of this early American history I have forgotten so it was off to look things up and refresh myself on this aspect of our lives. Oh, and Phillipa Soo has an absolutely amazing voice. I'm so happy I was ""forced"" to listen to this. It's the best of the best.",1466640000,5

Sam began his career as a gospel singer and spent six years years as lead singer of the legendary gospel group The Soul Stirrers. But in 1957, Sam Cooke decided to pursue a solo career and signed a recording contract with Keen records. Within a very short period of time Sam would notch his first big hit with a tune called ""You Send Me"". The record would go all the way to #1 and a major star was born.  Enjoy once again the dulcet tones of Sam Cooke.  This is the original hit recording that has recently been re-mastered for your listening enjoyment.",1466640000,5

""Diamond Bell"" reminds me in a lot of ways of ""Boy from Lawrence County"". They mix clever wordplay with mature emotional songs throughout. James's accordion is really highlighted throughout as well. Whether it is Celebration Florida or this album The Felice Brothers make the music they want to make. We are all better for it as Ian Felice is one of the best songwriters of his generation and shows why is family is insanely talented in so many ways. To think the amazing Simone Felice used to be a part of this band is like remembering Jason Isbell used to be in the Drive By Truckers. In both cases a crazy amount of songwriting riches.

Seriously all three of these women can really sing. Of course that's no surprise as they've all been around for a while and made names for themselves and being good singers. But together they really sound great!

The tracks all focus heavily on the vocals, which is smart for a collaboration like this. There is a band in the background but it's really subtle most of the time. Even when you can hear the band more prominently the vocals are still more strongly highlighted and not drowned out.

The harmony that the three of them produce is amazing.

Track 7 - Behind The Armory, particularly stood out to me as just being wonderful music. It's my favorite track on the album. But it's by no means the only good one.

Track 11 - I Want To Be Here, is probably the best example of the trio's harmony together.",1466726400,5

80172,128,18028,"The Ugly Heroes trio of Mello Music Group (Red Pill, Apollo Brown and Verbal Kent) have been the next big thing in hip-hop for the past three years, ever since they released their amazing, self-titled debut LP in 2013. They're easily considered one of Mello's best groups to date and outside of the label, they are making phenomenal strides, combining Apollo Brown's beautiful soul with RP and VK's smart, philosophical, mature, wise and professionally advanced lyrics. Each man has a story. Red Pill from Detroit, the burgeoning enlightened Millennial backpacker is growing healthily within the creative ecology of MMG, Apollo Brown (also from Detroit) is a very accomplished producer with a uniquely identifiable style and a long list of credits, and Verbal Kent of Rogers Park, Chicago also has a lengthy discography and highly trained rap-chops. To the joy of everyone, they release today (June 24) their second album, Everything in Between, still on Mello Music and still on a heroically message-hearty binge. It makes for two back-to-back stellar engagements starting with the Ugly Heroes LP, and who knows? Maybe they'll someday make it a trifecta.

Everything in Between gives us a lot of what we all need more of, beautiful universal truth. Let's start at the top. In ""Today Right Now,"" the refreshing lyrical duo of Red and Kent bring forth eye-opening revelations with the ultimate message being to not take life for granted, and they proceed with more fresh wisdom (""Daisies""), the advocation of good strong character (""Peace of Mind"") and their own experiences with diversity, tolerance and community (""Place Called Home""). The most time-marked, most newsworthy song of the first half, ""This World"" lets Kent and Red Pill set things straight and rap sense about maladies across the globe - racism, Trump, brutal police, etcetera, and everything is presented in a very calm, serene and unobjectionable way, especially thanks to Apollo Brown. His gorgeous soul and easygoing jazz productions are to die for, commonly agreeable listening for all.

Down the line, the subject of ""Can't Win For Losin'"" is falling on hard times, and then Red Pill, who is the biggest star of ""Roles,"" raps about being reluctant of bringing innocent children into a hateful world there. ""Heart Attack"" makes sure dreams, goals and high aspirations do not drop dead, and ""Unforgiven"" lays out two great rap stories. Red Pill confronts a detached resentful grandfather and Verbal Kent says accurately that a criminal set free by the justice system will forever be in mental prison. Lastly, they show their fangs in ""Fair Weather"" to help balance out any softness heard in the lead up sections. This timeless triumvirate are nothing short of magnificent in this perfect Everything in Between album. These Ugly Heroes could literally bring anyone onto their cause because one: they speak the truth and very eloquently at that, and two: they are backed by beat-prodigy Apollo Brown and his soothing jazz, blues and rock in a dynamic mixture. Furthermore, he reaffirms and strengthens his own style. Three heads are better than one here. Each man makes the other two tremendous people by giving them support and approval, and overall, they simply have an exceedingly splendid project on their hands and now it's in their fan's hands.",1466726400,5
80173,9088,18029,"I just received the newest release, Live at the Kessler, from Jim Suhler and Monkey Beat and it's really fun. Opening with I Declare, Suhler gets the crowd warmed up on lead vocal with excellent piano support from Shawn Phares, Chris Alexander on bass and Beau Chadwell on drums. Suhler has a great voice and great tone. On swampy, Across the Brazos, Chadwell's snappy drum beat and accordion like key work by Phares add extra flavor. Rock n' Roller, Doin' The Best I Can, is a hard driver with Suhler showing his super slide technique. This is a great cranker and Suhler presses on with strong support by Phares on keys. Excellent! Tijuana Bible has a real nice thumping bass line and grinding guitar riffs. With it's memorable melody and ZZ Top like feel, this track is hot! Deja Blue has a cool tandem vocal/lead guitar melody with accordion keys giving it a cajun feel. Single note bass line and steady drum lines gives the track a simple structure accenting Suhler's easy slung lead slide work. Very nice. Texassippi has a real nice southern country feel with really supple vocals and acoustic slide work. Sunday Drunk is a great rocker with a relentless bass line. Suhler stretches his strings quite nicely giving the track real bite. Devil In Me opens with a cool drum solo from Chadwell joined by Suhler on slide. Heavy toms and solid bottom is the key to this track with it's slight country taste. Suhler really lets it loose on this one with some slick slide riffs. Excellent! Panther Burn is a heavy lumbering track ... kind of a southern version of Levee Breaks. Alexander and Suhler on vocal with Suhler's slide work and solid drums really gives this track oomph. Scattergun is a really cool shuffle with lead slide. A pure blues number with boss bass lines, this track is great. Suhler and Phares really air it out here for one of the best tracks on the release. Po' Lightnin' has a cool funky beat and with nice lead bass lines and almost spoken lyrics. Prayin' For Rain, built over arpeggios on a theme, is a really sweet ballad. Wrapping the release is Restless Soul, a pure rockin' boogie. If this doesn't get you moving, nothing will. With plenty of slide work this track morphs into a driving version of Bullfrog blues and raw rowdy sliding blues. Excellent closer!  [...]",1466726400,4

80205,56,17906,"It has been a very long time since Maxwell made a impact with making deep music. When he released his 2009 album Blacksummers' Night, it came at a time when we were going through a tragic death in the world, with the loss of Michael Jackson. His work coming back in the music industry, after a seven year wait has been more of a shocker, but honestly it has been worth it. Especially when the R&B music industry has been more diluted with overexposed artists like Beyonce; Knowles and Rihanna that have made it more like it is garbage than brilliance. But for Maxwell, when he does a good song, it is worth listening to. Even if it is a surprising sample that is better than what radio sounds like today. 1990x, the second single from Maxwell's 2016 album, black Summers' Night is very soulful and intimate from his sensual and sophisticated voice. The song also takes on a Michael Jackson sample of his lesser-known song Heaven Can Wait from 2001's Invincible brilliantly. Maxwell really samples the song very well, and takes it more in a soulful simplistic direction. I was honestly very impressed, because it sounds better than the weights Jackson made for his song to sound like from years ago were not as brilliant as Maxwell makes of his washed-up song to a tune that meets Maxwell's heart so nicely. This is a real treat for die hard Maxwell fans, and for anyone that never heard his music before.

80206,9583,17639,"As with most Volbeat cds the first run doesnt do much for me, but by the second or third spin after I have deciphered some of the lyrics and started hearing some of the nuances of the songs I become hooked.
I have had this disk in my truck now for about 3 weeks and there are 6 songs that will make it off on to my iPod when the Saliva disk comes in and replaces it.
6 doesnt sound like a lot out of 13 songs, but that is better than most bands I listen to. I didn't even realize I was such a big Volbeat fan until an audit of my iPod songs showed me that behind Black Stone Cherry I had more Volbeat songs than any other band.
the 6 I like her are Devils Bleeding Crown, Black Rose, Battleship Chains, Bliss, Let it Burn and the title track Seal the Deal. several other songs are good, but if i cant remember the lyrics and name of a song by the 4th or 5th time i hear it then it is not going to be that special to me and i will just end up skipping it.
Keep in mind i have almost 800 songs at this point in my ipod, and thats how they all got there. By way of comparison I am a Black Stone Cherry fan, Shinedown, Theory of a Deadman is ok, i like Hell Yeah and Godsmack and others like that ..

it you like Volbeat this will be better than some releases but not as good as others .. if you don't like them then this will not win you over.

Cant wait to see them live again .. these guys lay it down live and are worth every penny.",1466726400,5

80209,1738,17785,"I'm a lifelong Beatles fan (like everyone else). I've always enjoyed McCartney's solo hits on the radio, but until I got this box set, I never realized just how consistently good his solo career has been, for 45+ years and counting. This box set is easily 5 stars, with the only notable omissions being ""Helen Wheels,"" ""Sally G,"" ""Letting Go"" and ""Take It Away"" (everyone will have a few nitpicks on every comp, and those are mine). But don't let that detract from what _is_ here. At 67 songs for less than $35, grab this while you can. The sound quality is excellent, drums and bass are crisp and clear.

The songs are the full-length album versions, which is nice. Compare the playing lengths of duplicated songs on ""Wingspan"" and the running times are longer here.

I listened to this box set all the way through, and rather than feeling like ""that was too much McCartney,"" I felt like ""darn, it's over already?""",1466726400,5

I have no idea why she has chosen to slur and mumble through her songs, but she has and her vocals make the songs not worthy of listening to them.  The instrumental portion of LW's music is great, but her vocals keep me from buying this crap.  Bob Dylan's voice sucks donkey dongs. So, it is not hard to understand why he sings the way he does.  On the other hand, Lucinda has (at least she used to have) a very good voice and why she would record her vocals as she does is beyond me.

80378,373,4397,"I normally don't review items that do not need closer scrutiny. I mean, EVERYONE has heard of AC/DC. AC/DC's sound; so distinct, so clean and tight, so ""RAW ROCK"" that each new generation that comes along hears the unique, universal, driving sound, and the newbies pick it up and makes this band their own. I've listened to this band for more years than I'll ever admit to, and I have every album they ever made. Through the years, behind the music, there was a story that is still being written. I'm reviewing this one because it was one of the best featuring the original singer, Bon Scott. Bon had a cynical but humorous outlook that was loved by all. He took care of the band like raising his kid brothers. His tongue in cheek bravado, kept the band together. His unwavering confidence in his boys was absolute. Just listen to the lyrics. In the beginning they barely earned enough money to eat, or clothe themselves. Their sound was distinct and catching. During an interview, someone asked Angus Young what kind of ""effects"" did he use to get his sound. Angus replied that he didn't; he simply plugged in his Gibson SG Custom (that guitar costs about $7000 nowadays, and was/is one of the only Gibson guitars that ever came out of the factory with a tremulow bar. The custom has pearl inlay, double humbucker coils, and Gibson guitars is one of the few guitars that are built out of SOLID mahogany, topped off with a lock nut, that will NOT, even after an hour of being tortured, GO OUT OF TUNE!) Angus took this, arguably, best guitar ever made,  and plugged it into a monster Marshal stack and turned it up as loud as it would go...and that's it. No effects or mixing. Just balls to the walls Rock. And one last thing: Angus' brother Malcolm. If the truth be known, Malcolm's PERFECT rhythm guitar playing MADE AC/DC's sound. While Angus, the band's ""gimmick"" --dressed in his (for real) school uniform-- ran around out front, amazing the crowds, playing some of the best riffs of all time, with his small stature, the crowd thought it was a CHILD eating this guitar alive. While getting all of this attention...well, it was MALCOLM that carried their sound. He stayed off to the side in the shadows, his head bowed in concentration, he never looked up, no one paid any attention, but Malcolm had this incredible timing and that big fat rhythm sound, and he never EVER, so much as missed a single chord! The cleanest rhythm I ever heard. Wow...One of the kings of the Guitar Rock era.
  I wrote this review for Bon (RIP) and Malcom.",1466812800,5

80388,7871,18056,"It's hard to tell specifically what the goal was here. While not outright pop music, this album has so much going on that it's like they tried to cover every conceivable base. What happens is confusion and sensory overload, and nothing sticks.  I really think they should just stop working with Rick Rubin. His approach does absolutely nothing for them anymore, it's unfortunate but this band has stagnated and nothing here is worth listening to more than a few times.

Just a terrible record with very little energy left.",1466812800,2

80397,7220,18058,"This album is much much better than Neon Icon. Neon Icon had too many edm/techno influenced tracks, compared to Peach Panther with only one. I'd rate this more 3.8/5 though. Personally, I feel like all the best tracks on here are the ones with no features, besides the songs w/ Dolla Bill Gates and Gucci Mane/Danny Brown. Glad Top Secret Productions is still apart of Riff Raff's team, as they provided the best production on here. Only complaint I really have is the intro song should have been longer and featured more rapping. Salute to Riff for dropping another gem.

Best songs:

80439,12301,17406,"Has the new working class American hero just walked into the room or what?

Rest In Chaos delivers a dusty bluesy countrified bit of rock n roll with some jam band psychedelic influences laced around the edges that allow it to go down easy, and dance across your ears long after the songs are over.  Hard Working Americans lay out a series of stories, and whether they're true or not doesnt matter in the least, cause Im taking em to heart, like they're happening down the street, in the car next to me at the light, and in the supermarket, where I get a whiff of weed as the guy in a tattered muscle shirt rolls by me, with all the wrong stuff filling his cart.

This is pure rock n roll with a sinister attitude belaying disorder, dystopia and an unsavory desire for salvation.  But not salvation from God, rather from skeptics and the streetwise, where gunslingers carry a hard-lived six string, and ride in muscle-cars shot with gray primer and windows that never roll up.  This is a band with a deep bottom and lyrics that hold your attention, sounding lost, forgotten, disregarded, impossible to ignore, and delivers an album that shivers with heart ... making the last minutes of the day seem like the best youve ever lived.

80443,3927,17786,"Many have heard Handclap.  While a good song that will get you moving, my favorite is A Place for Us.  Another favorite is Tricky and Get Right Back.

Fitz And The Tantrums can get even the most laid back person up out of their chair and moving to the music.  I like this more than ""More Than Just A
Dream,"" and that is saying something.",1466812800,5

80447,7220,17266,"If I was a 100% Drake fan, I would feel totally insulted that after a very good IYRTITL album and pretty good banger-filled WATTBA mixtape, that he puts out this underwhelming mess. I've been hear only the stanniest of Drake stans praise this album as some transcending genre-bending album, but all it is is a terribly mediocre, formulaic, water-down version of Take Care. It's almost embarrassing to even listen to. There's literally 4 tracks...4....FOUR tracks worth anything. Views, 9, Faithful, and......wow, I can't even think of the other song, that's how forgettable this album is, that even the good tracks aren't even all that. The rest of the album is filled with corny haiku-like ballads, reggae riddims that would sound better if they weren't so forced, and overall WEAK production. Drake should be embarrassed for feeding this album to his fans, and the worst part about it is they all eat it up and shoot it to the top of the charts, forcing upcoming artists to attempt to make the same type of garbage he put on on here. This HAS to be the least replay value worth album in Drake's entire catalog, which is a shame for such a popular artist.",1466812800,1

80470,7578,14745,"It's a song, that when I first heard it,  moved me in such a way, that I'm not quite sure I can put into words.  It was to me so deep in meaning, so I promised myself that when I had the coins I would buy that track.  Little did I know that the day after I purchased it, I would play it.  I had just lost the love of my life to God and we had previously held each other, knowing that there wouldn't be many more time before God called him home.",1466899200,5
80471,53,1303,"The Pretty Reckless Light Me Up is a very good rock CD with 11 songs and full of emotions that everyone can relate to.  The singer's voice is also very good and on most songs you will feel like humming along or singing along in your car or at home.  Track one expresses the effects of drugs on the singer's life, track two another good rock song with decent lyrics but personally prefer the live version found on the CD single ""Hit Me Like A Man.""  Track 3 is a song you can't help but sing along to and relate to the lyrics at some point in your life ""I'll Never Be Good Enough"", track 4 is a song with strange lyrics but the singer is right about one main thing no matter how much we desire to change ""Can't Be Anything Else But Me.""  Track 5 is another song you can hum along to and enjoy moving to the music but in the end she will get her revenge on those who hurt her, track 6 shows how much you want to numb out the pain, hurt, so you take anything to drown it out but for ""Just Tonight.""  Track 7 shows how fast fame, fortune comes to your life, and then in blink of an eye it's turns you into ""Miss Nothing, track 8 is a song about the singer looking for her hero to save her from 'Going Down.""  Track 9 is another song about trying to fill the void in your life but this time trying to find it in love, religion, or even fame in the form of ""Rock and Roll"", track 10 threw the pain and sorrow you need that special someone to help you get threw it and keep you going.  Last track 11 is a feel good song about enjoy life and having fun by trying to get into the parties and you can move to the music bob your head or body threw the song start to end.",1466899200,4

80479,2571,456,"I saw Eden's Edge live.  They opened for Lady Antebellum a little while before this cd came out.  I had heard the song Amen and just about fell in love with Hannah Blaylock who's name Hannah fit's her because I thought she looked like Miley Cyrus.  Then it seemed like it took a long time for this cd to come out.  And when it finally did.  It is my choice for album of the year.  At least in my cd collection.  Amen turned out to be the only thing close to a hit that they had.  Hannah soon got married and the band dissolved.  Our loss.  There is not a bad song on here.  Swingin' Door, Last Supper the Gosphel Acapella Christ Alone are all super.  But as good as this cd is.  The song Cherry Pie makes it even better.  About all the people in your life who  have influenced you and made you the person you are.  And Cherry Pie is a horse so it is not only about people.  It get's me to thinking about my own life.  And I have to admit if I am listening to it by myself I get a little choked up.  It is stunning.",1466899200,4

80490,5052,18069,"Here's another great Big Box from Bach Guild. I call it delicious because that's what it's like to listen to this wonderful collection of American rags. We have virtually the whole output of Scott Joplin in very fine and graceful performances, of which perhaps the best are by William Balcom, though Virginia Eskin and John Arpin are also very fine. Then there are further offering by other leading rag composers, especially as Joseph Lamb.
Another highlight is an hour's worth of rags by women composers, of whom the standouts, on a first hearing, are May Aufderheide and Julia Niebergall.

I'm also extremely pleased to have almost two hours of pieces by the mid-19th Century Creole composer Louis Moreau Gottschalk, some of it piano solos played by Eugene List and some of it duos including list and Reid Nibley.  Gottschalk wasn't strictly a rag composer, in fact, he predates them by nearly half a century. But like Joplin &c, Gottschalk was a piano-centered composer who combined classical and popular styles, while encorporating flavorful regional folk elements into his music--so to my ears, he fits right in.

At the price, there's no reason not to scoop up this delicious treat, almost like a triple-dipper ice cream cone of your favorite flavors, for 99 cents.",1466899200,5

There are a LOT of Rebel Rouser remakes available for download and none are as good as the original.  Some early digital versions of Rebel Rouser have a fade-in at the start and an early fade-out.  This track sounds the way the original sounded on a 1958 45 RPM record.  It is the lead track on a 1958 summertime anthology I produced for my personal library.",1466899200,5

Its still a great album though that showcases catchy ditties about teenage love and heartbreak. She vacillates between resignation on tracks like THATS THE WAY BOYS ARE, the terrific, boisterous BOYS and THATS THE WAY THE BALL BOUNCES to steely determination when dealing with the machinations of the opposite sex on LEAVE ME ALONE, DONT CALL ME and the fabulously moody IM COOLIN NO FOOLIN.

There are 13 Bonus Tracks culled from her first two albums ILL CRY IF I WANT TO and SINGS OF MIXED UP HEARTS. Now, if you already own the Japanese Remasters of these that were released by Oldays Records and Universal Japan, these tracks all sound better and clearer on those releases than they do here. But if you haven't heard the Japanese versions and only want the best tracks from those albums, this CD will suffice. The sound quality is still great here, but the clarity of the Japanese CDs is astounding. I was originally going to pass on this CD since I already have all 12 songs from BOYS BOYS BOYS on the 1994 Big Bear box set, but they sound much better here so I am glad I bought it plus it has great liner notes and photos in the booklet.

80562,56,18079,"There are sometimes songs that are worth being remixed and sampled that they are better later on. But in the case with covering a song today, it can be as bigger or smaller than when the song had originally came out. Fall Out Boy has had a nice return to the industry a few years ago with Centuries and Uma Thurman. But when I had heard that they were going to do a remake of a classic movie song, I was honestly not impressed with what I had heard. In fact, it sounded much cheaper than when Ray Parker Jr. was accused of stealing from Huey Lewis & The News's hit I Want A New Drug back in the 80's. Fall Out Boy's version of the Ghostbusters (I'm Not Afraid) is honestly one of the cheapest remakes that sounds much worse than what I had first heard years ago. It is not only a poor remake, but definitely is one of those songs that you can easily say, ""Boy, did I waste my time on this song!"" The guys from Fall Out Boy did better covers before, like their rendition of Michael Jackson's Beat It several years ago. You're better off downloading the original, or the original sample from 1984. This version is definitely not worth the money!!

80586,13482,17730,"The music: My normal tastes have evolved to the point that I like my music hard. Like hard rock is at the soft end of my spectrum and on the other end metal, be it Thrash like Megadeth or NWOBHM bands like Judas Priest. However I listen on occasion to Jazz, Blues, Industrial bands like NIN or White Zombie and somewhere in that screwed up mixture I discovered Primus about 5 years ago and bought their entire discography. I'm a fan of anything and everything Claypool. Sean Lennon is a new artist for me and only know of his fathers work. Well, they seem to be a great collaboration! My vinyl collection is only around 100 reissues all bought new, but is ever growing and expanding as I have caught the dreaded vinyl bug.

I was drawn to this album because of well, any 2LP set at under $20 catches my eye, especially colored vinyl, and especially including Claypool. So with that knowledge only, I youtubed the entire album while on the treadmill and immediately knew this album was special and deserved shelf space in my mancave. I thought this will be great when I need a break from the screaming I've come accustomed to, and the trippy atmospheric elements were pure ear candy. I could not buy this album fast enough and of course served up on my main vinyl rig via Senn HD598 kicked things up about 10 notches over the youtubed treadmill session. Really beautiful, and full of relevant lyrics.

A word about quality control (vinyl). What have I got to do to get an album that's not warped, drilled centered and trimmed neatly around the edge??? Thank God I've got a vinyl flat in my future... I even had side-A come with a weird visible coating of like a frosted film over the entire record. Dead quiet recording though and man oh man what a powerful clear sound this album has.

In closing, my highest recommendation. It really made a nice addition to my collection and if you haven't heard it yet?",1466899200,5

It made for a very good listen. I'm not a Drake fan, but he knows how to craft some good songs, and i would have to put IYRTITL as probably his second best release behind Take Care. The production is fairly dark, with a handful of lively beat thrown in to break up any possible monotony. Drake is a decent rapper and a decent singer, but a very good artist overall, and makes for a really good product. This album may be long, but it doesn't really feel that way upon listening. My favorite tracks are Madonna, Legend, Know Yourself, and No Tellin', all on the first half of the album. 6PM In New York, 10 Bands, and Company with Travis Scott (one of only a handful of features) are notable songs too. A lot of nice samples used throughout as well.",1466985600,4

80654,1620,18002,"Where did this movie come from?  I wasn't even aware that a Tarzan movie was in the works until the soundtrack was made available on Amazon.  Since then, I've watched a few of the trailers and the movie looks impressive and it seems to have earned some positive feedback from those who have seen it.  It appears to have been released overseas and is slated for a July 1st opening in the United States.  Rupert Gregson-Williams is providing the score for this latest film about the iconic character and some of you film score fans might see something familiar about that name.  Rupert Gregson-Williams is the younger brother of film score composer Harry Gregson-Williams (who has done films like ""Chronicles of Narnia"", ""X-Men Origins:  Wolverine"", ""The Equalizer"", and ""The Martian"").  I was first introduced to Rupert Gregson-Williams through his ""Battlefield 2:  Modern Combat"" (2005) video game score.  He's also done numerous film scores for Adam Sandler's Happy Madison Productions, as well as, a lot of animated film like ""Over the Hedge"" 2006) and ""Bee Movie"" (2007).  I know he also provided the score for ""Winter's Tale"" (2014) but that is one that I haven't heard yet.  ""The Legend of Tarzan"" appears to be a move towards some of the more blockbuster type films that his brother gets involved with and I think he's done a fairly good job with this one.

The score begins with ""Opar"" (track 1) performed by Zoe Mthiyane.  This opening track immediately takes you to the mysterious and foreboding jungle landscape.  This opening piece is both beautiful and dangerous with Mthiyane's vocals setting up the mood of the setting wonderfully.  She also provides her talents briefly in the piece entitled ""Elephants in the Night"" (track 13).  Her work here combined with RGW's (Rupert Gregson-Williams) music really works well together in creating a peaceful and almost magically surreal moment in the score as you envision these animals in their habitat.  ""Diamonds"" (track 2) is a bit less interesting and appears to be more conflict introducing.  I suspect that there is evil and greed surrounding the diamond trade here.  The tone of the piece is largely ominous evil with a dash or horror mixed in.  I particularly enjoyed some of the more sentimental pieces in the score like ""Togetherness"" (track 3), ""Campfire"" (track 7) and ""Tarzan and Jane"" (track 8).  ""Campfire"" is a bit bolder, thematic, and heroic with it's accompanying support of a choir.  The pieces are not overly complex and at times can be quite daydreamy, especially in the case of ""Tarzan and Jane"".

A Tarzan movie means action and adventure however and you can be sure to find some of that music here as well.  ""Akut Fight"" (track 12) is a really interesting one that grows into an all out brawl.  The percussion work is great and there is this wild sounding tribal (electronically generated) horn sound that is pretty intense.  ""Stampede"" (track 19) is also an epic sounding action track that shifts into various movements to keep things interesting and ""The Legend of Tarzan"" (track 21) revisits some of the themes and moments found throughout the score.

The score definitely works and has plenty of moments both in the action and sentimental realms to keep things interesting and enjoyable to listen to.  The tribal percussion work, solo vocals provided by Zoe Mthiyane, and choir work from the London Voices really help to bring us to this environment and take you away on an adventure in Tarzan's world.  I wish the score could of been more ""organic"" in it's presentation however and rely less on some of the electronically produced instrument sounds.  It would of been great to experiment with unusual and exotic instrumentation to help connect more with the jungle environment of the film.  Although Hans Zimmer is not specifically credited in the liner notes, I'm sure he played an advisory role somewhere.  The score is big and it's diverse enough to keep things interesting however.

Apparently they are not releasing an official CD for this soundtrack so I opted to go for the CDR version offered by Amazon.  Both the digital download and CDR versions of the score are currently inexpensive fortunately.  The CDR sounds great and all tracks played flawlessly.  There is a 12 page insert that contains photos from the film, a brief note from director David Yates, production credits, and some photos of Hozier in the studio working on the included song ""Better Love"" (track 22).  Hozier fans won't be disappointed with this latest song from the talented artist.  He wrote this song specifically for this film and it obviously reflects the love between Tarzan and Jane.  The CDR contains 22 tracks with a running time of 1 hour and 12 minutes.",1466985600,4

There is more romantic stuff and less impressionistic and late romantic music than I would prefer. Thee are several highlights. Emil Gilels playing Saint
Saens 3rd Concerto is worth the price of the album alone. The early recorder and soprano stuff is an absolute delight. I could have done without the can can music and would have preferred more Debussy and Ravel. Perhaps another box is in order with  impressionistic and contemporary French music?

80779,8899,17870,Produced by Tom Petty... great garage rock sound.,1467072000,4
80780,1330,16876,"I wrote this about his previous album: 'even though some of the ""meterer-modern"" sounds he's employed aren't all to my liking, what's valuable is that they've established a pathway by which he is free to develop himself as an artist, and not get typeset as a pure throwback or genre study.'

In a way I was correct, he took the opportunity to further stretch his traditional country roots into further explorations.  The effects here though do not work out for me.  He's sort of molding a 60s black pop sound with horns, where the dynamics never vary.  It's a very boring album  I don't recommend it.  Ironically I do like the one song I'll bet many others won't: the In Bloom cover, even though I'm not a Nirvana fan.  It makes me think that this might have been a better production if he'd done an album's worth of cover songs, the way The Band did on Moondog Matinee.

I give it 3 stars because it isn't terrible.  It's just not a good effort from a superior artist, imo.  This isn't to suggest it's anywhere near as loathsome as the commercial packaged 'urban' junk coming out of Nashville today.  But if we were able to totally ignore such stuff, and only consider albums I've bought in the past year, then it would get only 1 star.",1467072000,3

80784,1463,18105,"Well-known harpist and composer Peter Sterling is definitely in the groove with his latest release, Sacred Visions. The recording combines the rhythms of both East and West in a unique alchemy of ancient and contemporary elements. The result is an album of uplifting positive energy tracks that is sure to raise your spirit and get your toe tapping.

On this album Peter displays his prodigious musical talents on electric harp, Guzeng (Chinese harp), piano, keyboards and loops, percussion, ocarina, recorder, and vocals. Peter also enlists the assistance a number of fine musical accompanists such as Bruce Becvar, Robin Miller, and Fitzhugh Jenkins on guitars, William Aura and Craig Dobin of the band 3rd Force on bass and piano respectively, Hans Christian on cello and sarangi, and Richard Hardy on sax, flute, and pennywhistle.

In addition to drawing inspiration for a number of songs from the natural beauty of his home in Sedona, Arizona, where he often leads tours to sacred sites, influences of India and even a bit of Celtic flavor are reflected on the album. Peter and company cover a lot of diverse musical territory on the album. While largely rhythmic, other facets of Peters sonic spectrum are reflected as well, providing a perfect showcase for his diverse talents and comfort with a variety of musical modes and the many instruments he plays. One of the things that stand out to me in Peters music is the strong sense of spirituality that is expressed. Sacred Visions is an inspired blend of various musical and cultural elements that is both earthy and transcendental that makes for a totally enjoyable listening experience.

80809,5777,9304,"After the breakup of The Beatles each member would of course go on to form their own solo career. John, Paul and George would certainly go on to have hits songs and chart toppers but it always seemed to me that Ringo was over looked a bit in what he accomplished in the years after going out on his own. Yeah he maybe didn't have as big an impact as his former bandmates on the charts but that doesn't mean he wasn't putting out some great music. He most definitely was. The album ""Photograph: The Very Best Of Ringo"" (a greatest hit compilation) is good proof of that. His music maybe didn't have the depth and social message to it as the other former lads were but Ringo's music I always thought was great good times, party kind of music sure to please and entertain anyone looking for some uplifting music.

My favorite Ringo song of all time one of his earliest hits, ""It Don't Come Easy"". Not necessarily one of his ""party"" songs but with a good beat, strong lyrics and Ringo in fine voice makes for an enjoyable piece of music. If you could only download one song by Ringo from his solo career you wouldn't go wrong adding this to your MP3 player.",1467072000,5

80826,2664,18114,"The debut release from this U.K. based supergroup features songs that move from big, soaring atmospheres to a massive roar of world-filling ambient noise, while projecting a post-shoegaze psychedelic power.  Vocal harmonies glide on soundwaves that integrate symphonic synthesizers with industrial percussion.  Haunting heavenly auras are elevated by dark, hypnotic fog-clouds of dissonance and beauty.  Many of the songs begin with a quietly provocative, dreamy elegance that frequently evolves into a turbulent maelstrom of savage & stunning allure.  The breathy innocence of Rachel Goswells voice provides a brilliant pop balance to the thick churn of electronic radiance.

80842,2664,17241,"The 9th album from this U.K. band projects a subtle sort of edgy, nervous tension thats surrounded and engulfed by a soaring swirl of magnanimous and expansive, gloriously radiant beauty with a near-religious fervor.  Thom Yorkes voice implores all the little gods of the universe with its slurred open-wound fragility.  Classical lounge piano and orchestrated choral clouds of mystic-threaded magic intertwine with haunted acoustic guitars and motorik rhythmic soundscape atmospheres.  As usual, Radioheads music both confuses & intrigues, as it vacillates from sleepy monotony to stimulating electric jolts of sound.  On A Moon Shaped Pool the band reaches for an alternate audio reality of hypnotic sophistication.  Whether they ultimately find it will depend on your interpretation of the energy & flow.  Either way, its a stellar effort.",1467072000,4

The guitar solo by Ritchie Blackmore is insanely wicked, one of the best I've ever heard.

80886,56,16940,"It surprises me that there are still some singers that have been more unsung, than really soulful on radio. Unfortunately, Chrisette Michele has been one of those songstresses that does deserve more credit because of her soul from the voice alone, but somberly she has never gotten it, in the severe overexposure of others like Rihanna and Beyonce' Knowles, whom are more products than people. Hard to believe that it has been a decade since she came out of the bloom with her debut album, I Am, and she still has had better music than most of the jokes on radio today. Sadly, Chrisette has such a beautiful soul but she still never has gotten the credit she deserves with her work. Her latest single, tries to show that Chrisette is going for a more modern R&B sound that really does work in her favor, where she has had several songs from the past few years not work in her favor. Unbreakable, the lead single from her 5th album Milestone, is short and simple but shows she is still making better songs than what is out there in radio today. This is a nice download if you have followed Chrisette Michele for the past decade, and if you really enjoy her work.

Song: B 1/2-",1467158400,4
80887,9693,17964,"This album is nothing short of fantastic.  Ive been a pretty heavy follower of K.D. Lang in the late 80s and 90s.  She couldn't do any wrong with her gender bending - genre crossing songs.  As time when by I discovered Neko Case in the late 90s.  I was fascinated by her rock n roll ambient folk twists.  It seemed like music right up my alley.  Blacklisted is still my favorite album.  Set me off on a whole new direction of indie folk rock.  In 2003 I came across Laura Veirs because I loved the direction of indie folk rock and was taking and was always searching for new artists.  The Triumphs and Travails of Orphan Mae was my first and in my cd rotation quite frequentlythe hints of bluegrass folk and that beautiful haunting voice was the ticket to my ears.  Ive followed ever since and saw her at the Doug Fir after the in the Warp and Weft album (which is still one of my favorite albums created by her).
Which brings me to the awesome collaboration women and music styles that make up a very distinct era of folk rock.  Each are unique and beautiful in their own right blending seamlessly into a very beautifully produced album.  How lucky are we to have all three  who ever had THAT idea needs an extra star!  I certainly don't agree with other reviewers that the album sounding the same  that is simply not possible with such distinct styles.  Gee, and if you don't know of Neko or Laura someone needs to plant you in front of some good speakers and give you a real education in music.  Plan to see them July 2nd in Portland!",1467158400,5

80908,10771,18128,"Willie Sugarcapps' eponymous debut was so enjoyable this album comes as a let down.  The easy-going, good-natured comraderie of the first album is absent here and the group experiments with wider variety of instrumentation, not to good effect.  For example, there's one real clunker  (""Mancel Travis"") that features a screechy electric guitar.  The appealing vocal blend, intimacy, and high quality acoustic musicianship of the first album has vanished, but the real problem is the songs--there's not a good one in the bunch.  The songwriting is very unfocused--half the time you have no idea what they're singing about--and the melodies are instantly forgetable.  You'll give this album one listen through and never play it again.",1467158400,2

80955,12631,3959,"It was a relatively short but highly successful run. Between 1965 and 1970 a five man group from Los Angeles known as The Turtles produced some of the biggest and brightest pop records of the decade. The Turtles came out of nowhere in the summer of '65 with their debut single ""It Ain't Me Babe"".  The song was written by Bob Dylan who seemed to be all the rage that year and it climbed all the way to #8 on the national charts. Most folks just presumed that The Turtles were a folk group and were a bit surprised that a number of the groups subsequent releases were pure pop. The group continued to release singles such as ""You Baby"" and ""Can I Get To Know You Better"" with varying degrees of success until early 1967 when they finally struck pay dirt with a tune called ""Happy Together"".  This would prove to be their biggest and best remembered record. But as far as I'm concerned the Turtles finest single was the follow-up to ""Happy Together"".  The upbeat, bouncy ""She'd Rather Be With Me"" peaked at number 3 nationally during the Summer of Love. The song was also a huge hit in Ireland, Denmark, Canada, South Africa and the United Kingdom. This is the original White Whale recording you would remember from the radio.",1467158400,5

Though hits and international fame would come later, the eight tracks released in 1981-2 remain the groups purest statement of their 60s-tinged harmony rock. They never wrote, played or sang with more elan, and the youthful effervescence of this early work is as compelling today as it was thirty-five years ago. The group first appeared on vinyl as The Bangs with the fan club single Getting Out of Hand b/w Call On Me. Its local circulation left most listeners to meet the band, renamed as The Bangles, on the compilation Rodney on the ROQ, Vol. III, and then retroactively track down the singles more widely circulated reissue.

In 1982, amid the the Salvation Armys&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/self-titled-debut/dp/B000003SU5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">self-titled debut</a>, Green on Reds&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/debut-EP/dp/B001RXK38S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">debut EP</a>, the Dream Syndicates&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Days-of-Wine-and-Roses/dp/B00X0UUEXA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Days of Wine and Roses</a>, the Three OClocks&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Baroque-Hoedown/dp/B000003SSU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Baroque Hoedown</a>, and the Rain Parades first single, there was the Bangles self-titled five song EP on Faulty. The EPs four original songs were the perfect lead-in to a scorching cover of the La De Das How is the Air Up There? Though reissued by IRS, the EP was mostly lost to fans the band picked up with their major label debut,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/All-Over-the-Place/dp/B003XKB0DA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">All Over the Place</a>, and even more so in the full rush of fame brought by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Different-Light/dp/B00000264B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Different Light</a>. Bits and pieces of the EP reappeared as B-sides and on compilations, but the full EP remained unreissued until this collection was released as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MP3s/dp/B00PIF0D2M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MP3s</a>&nbsp;in 2014. Now on CD, the EP can be heard without compression.

Filling out this disc are four full-fidelity demos, a pair of 1984 live tracks, and a commercial for No Magazine. The demos include early takes of Call On Me and The Real World, a harmony-rich cover of the Turtles Outside Chance and a tough take on Paul Revere and the Raiders Steppin Out. The live cuts are Tell Me (from All Over the Place), and a cover of Loves 7 & 7 Is. The disc closes with 1982s The Rock & Roll Alternative Program Theme Song, a tune the group recorded for George Gimarcs pioneering radio show.  The only thing missing is the promo-only 12 remix of The Real World, but thats a nit. This is the holy grail for Bangles fans, especially those who never completely cottoned to the commercial polish of their Columbia years. [2016 Hyperbolium]",1467158400,5

I only liked a couple songs from his debut Pluto, and didn't really like Honest at all, but in between that time, I really liked the Black Woodstock and FBG: The Movie mixtape, along with random songs here and there (Ain't No Way Around It, Hard, Itchin', etc). Him dropping his 3 Peat series of Beast Mode, Monster, and 56 Nights is what made me truly a fan, and I HAD to buy this album simply for dropping such high quality stuff beforehand. And if you liked any of the previous tapes listed, DS2 is a must have.

Her voice (Graham Nash said) is ""Insane"" especially for someone that was only 20. She was a incredible musician/songwriter as well. And she made it look so very easy.  Adam Levine mentioned on the voice that Christina arranged the version of ""Hold On We're Going Home all by herself and changed a rap song into a gorgeous ballad.  She was a musical genius in my opinion. Just Brilliant.  I honestly never heard of Christina Grimmie before, until this absolutely horrible disgusting tragedy happened and she was shot and killed.  I watched a few videos of her on you tube of her performances on the Voice and Christina's voice is just so incredible.  Online it mentioned that she had a three octave vocal range, which I am not surprised after hearing some of her songs on youtube. which can't be surpassed. Do yourself a favor and buy this and am pretty sure you will be happy with this purchase.  Christina's incredible voice will live on forever, RIP Christina!!!!

81000,12631,986,"I am a bit embarrassed to have to admit this but I guess I never did fully appreciate the abundant talent of one Wilson Pickett while he was still among us. Like so many other kids who grew up in the 1960's I was completely captivated by the Motown sound while the real afficianados of soul music were groovin' to the sounds of James Brown and Wilson Pickett. Wilson Pickett was a consummate pro who put his heart and soul into every song he ever recorded. In 1963 Pickett met guitarist/producer Steve Cropper. Most observers would agree that it was Cropper who was largely responsible for launching Wilson's highly successful solo career at Atlantic. Over the next couple of years they would collaborate on memorable tunes like ""634-5789"" and ""Ninety Nine and One Half"".  Another fabulous tune from this period was the 1965 hit ""In the Midnight Hour' which was a monster R&B hit and peaked at #21 on the pop charts.  This was the ""Wicked Pickett"" at his absolute best.",1467158400,5

81063,12824,17444,"I could barely recognize rihanna voice with all the auto tune and computer mix. Rihanna vocal is a tad over process . She has a great voice and didn't need so much auto tune .

Great song , great beat . very catchy . Will make you dance all summer . House beat and a club feels to it .

I m a big fan of calvin harris/rihanna collaboration . ""We found love"" was a great hit so is this one. The result is amazing . Those two always produce something great when working together . Hope those two will keep collaborating . I want more !

While the video itself won't earn video of the year and is a bit repetitive , its very well filmed, well done (esthetically speaking),and quite original . Rihanna looks so stunning and drop dead gorgeous in the video .

The cd cover itself is a huge let down , they could have done so many things better than this .I wish they used rihanna on the cover  .

Also what a shame that this song is not avaible for prime users. Hopefully amazon will add it soon .

Overall a great hit , to listen to again and again .",1467244800,5

81065,4505,18038,"This music is wonderful! You're listening to songs you know well (for the most part) yet they have an entirely different sound to them. So you are listening to new music that sounds familiar and comforting. It's not ALL piano music, despite the band's name. It's got a variety of string instruments.

The four tracks that will probably resonate with the largest number of people are...

 Over The Rainbow - It's just what it claims to be. It's Somewhere Over The Rainbow from The Wizard of Oz. But it sounds totally unique. It's got a mild Caribbean beat in the background. (You heard me! And it sounds cool)

 Batman Evolution - This is really cool. It's the various Batman theme songs merged into a single track. It starts with the Adam West Batman TV show (The ""nananananananananana BATMAN!"" version) and merges into the Michael Keaton Batman movie them, then into the horrible Batman movies that we won't get into the details of, and then into the Christian Bale era. It's really cool if you're a Batman fan. If you're not a Batman fan then it still sounds neat.

 Let If Go - Imaging the theme song from Frozen with a sound more similar to the theme song from Game of Thrones. That's what you get here. Even if you are one of the three hundred million people who never want to hear that song again, it's like something totally new here.

 Ants Marching - It's the Blues Traveler Song! And it sounds incredible! There are minor vocals on this one, mostly just whistles and ""na na na na's"".

There is more on there that a lot of people will recognize. But I think those will be the 4 that appeal to the widest audience in terms of familiarity.

Ultimately this is great music to put on while you're working to help you chill out and just be in a good mood. It's relaxing. It's fun. I sounds cool. I highly recommend trying this out.

I had never heard of these guys before Amazon put a big banner at the top of my screen and said ""Listen to the Piano Guys"".

Well played, Amazon. Well played.",1467244800,5
81066,9682,16922,Great song. I like the Caribbean sound it have with the steel drums,1467244800,5
81067,6753,11122,Great worship song.,1467244800,5
81068,4505,18149,"The Lumineers have such a soothing sound that their music can literally change your entire outlook on a day. They are one of my go to bands to put on when I'm just in a lousy mood. They touch your soul, and I don't go throwing terms like that around lightly.

This playlist isn't all Lumineers. It pulls the best tracks from both of their albums. (The Lumineers and Cleopatra) With about 20 Lunineers songs here, that's roughly half of each of their albums. Quite frankly it must have been hard to leave out the other half of those albums because they are both great.

Its got about 20 other bands mixed in, but it's heavily weighted towards the Lumineers. (Not that you need me to tell you this. You can read the set list above) I think most of the other bands flow well with the Lumineers' music so they go really well together. The Strumbellas (Shovels & Dirt) in particular have a very similar style and work great when mixed into this set.

To highlight some of the non Lunineers stuff that really stood out to me...

Mumford & Sons (Awake My Soul, Track 12) is an established group that you probably already know is great.

Family Of The Year (Hero, Track 19) is a band I wasn't familiar with at all and I loved their contribution to this enough to go check out more from them.

Edward Sharpe & The Magnetic Zone (Free Stuff, Track 25) These guys are a little more popular, and they absolutely belong on this set. They have an awesome sound that could almost be confused for the Lumineers. Almost.

The extra good news about the other bands on this set list is that I don't see any band other than the Lumineers with more than one track. So if there is a band in here that isn't right for you, you can skip them once and never hear them again.

If you need to chill out and feel music flowing through you, this is the set list that'll get that done.",1467244800,5

81081,482,18152,"Anders Osborne's ""Spacedust & Ocean Views"" is a strong set.  My general impression is that Osborne turns down the pacing compared to his rocking set ""Peace"" that had a hit in my personal top ten of ""Dream Girls""  I like his 1999 CD ""Living Room"" that was more acoustic based and closer to this set.  Here, there are some softer sounds, some blues-tinged tracks, and some swamp swagger.  Of my two favorite tracks, ""Lafayette"" bounces to a mid-tempo beat and Osborne's vocals slurred and sloppy, ""Some people tell me I get the truth, but I can't have it if I get the blues.""  ""Wind"" is another inventive track, ""Looking for a wind that knows my midnight, make me feel alive.""  Other tracks like ""Move Back to Mississippi,"" ""Tchoupitoulas Street Parade"" and ""Ponchartrain"" are also gems.  Osborne's latest set is a bit more subtle, but rewarding with repeated spins.  Enjoy!",1467244800,4

81086,56,18153,"There is no question of why Phil Collins has a lot to celebrate. Musically, he has been celebrating the 35th anniversary of Face Value being released, and Phil had re-issued his entire catalog from beginning to end. His songs really sound better than ever, and he has really introduced himself nicely to the so-called Beyonce' and Rihanna generation that has been all about the product on the outside, not the person on the inside making the music. Phil had been making music for over 45 years on his own and with Genesis, and he has definitely been one of the more quintessential entertainers that I love, not only because of his musicianship, but how very strong his songs have been over the years. It all honestly started with one song that was all about heartbreak, In The Air Tonight. The song is still just as haunting and hypnotic at the very dark soul as it was when it was released back in 1981. Phil definitely had strong feelings about divorce and definite sadness and angst, and he used it very well in song. If you had never heard a Phil Collins song before, than this is one I sincerely recommend you listen to first.

81099,12631,5417,"As the story goes one morning in 1967 Smokey Robinson and fellow Motown songwriter Al Cleveland were shopping at Hudson's, a Detroit department store. Robinson found a set of pearls for his wife, Claudette. ""They're beautiful."" he said to the salesperson. ""I sure hope she likes them."" Cleveland then added ""I second that emotion."" Both songwriters laughed at Cleveland's verbal error; he had meant to say ""I second that motion."" The two were immediately inspired to write a song using the incorrect phrase. The culmination of their efforts was Smokey Robinson and the Miracles huge hit ""I Second That Emotion"". The song would peak at #4 on the Billboard Hot 100 around Christmas 1967. It would be one of The Miracles biggest hits ever.  This is the original hit recording you would remember from the radio.",1467244800,5

81146,2115,15437,"I'd like to give a more in depth, track specific, review, but honestly I had such lack of motivation to listen to this that I've only heard it 3 or 4 times all the way through.  I tried a few others but could never make it through.

If you're looking for a Primal Fear album full of PF cliches, recycled riffs, recycled melodies and filler tracks which will have you running for albums like Jaws Of Death and Black Sun then this is for you.  NONE of these songs are worth being recorded.  Granted there isn't 1 terrible song on here but there isn't a single good song on here either, hence the 1 star rating.  It's all filler.  the last album was bad but at least there were 3 or 4 songs I really liked.  this one doesn't have any I can even remember except Rulebreaker which might be sadly the highlight.  It's probably good for a filler song but that's about it.  When they try to change things up they basically put movie trailer music as the intro to an overly long song ""We Walk Without Fear"" and call that progress.  I mean seriously I expected to hear the movie trailer guy talking over it saying things like ""Coming..  July.. 31st..  Get.. Ready..  For..  Action"" followed by a list of actors or some variation.  I don't think they do those trailers anymore actually.

I'm not saying Primal Fear needs to be anything other than what they are.  Sure some experimentation would be nice, but they don't have to stop being a power metal band or anything, but they need to stop using the same riffs, melodies, and drum beats and try to write something that's actually good.  But this will please the people who only want the same stuff over and over and don't care if a band puts effort into creating a good album or releases another stale boring release.  I like these guys I really do.  I like most songs on all of their albums from the self titled through Unbreakable, but I feel they've gotten too comfortable and no one, no producers and certainly not the fans, are pushing them to do better.",1467331200,1

81155,15197,17097,"I don 't have any of my best headphones on this computer, I'm using a headset, but the combined re-mix, Analog to Digital Converters, mastering technique, most of these songs sound even better to me now. I bought just about ever CD that the Delfonics released since CD's first came out ($600 for a CD player then), because something was missing or not in stereo on that CD. Most of these re-mixes are very clean, and again I'll have to replace 90% of the Delfonics songs on my MP3 player with these. What stood out to me was the first recordings were made at the old Cameo-Parkway building, which later became Philly International on Broad street, but when Sigma was opened in 1968, and the Delfonics started recording there, you can really hear on these CD's the voices of Thom Bell if you know it, with the background vocals, until he stopped producing them. The horns sound fantastic, especially Joe (the lips) D, and on The Delfonics theme near the end, I could have sworn that was Lenny Pakula on the organ making that sound alone, but now I hear a Kettle drum roll with him that I never hear before with this cheap headset, I had to backup to make sure I wasn't hearing things. Next I'll play this CD I'll use my good phones, or through speakers. It's hard to believe some of these recordings are 49 years old. Any disappointments? Yes, just 3 for me. Can't get over Losin' you; was remixed in mono, ""I gave to you""; was not the extended version, and the extended version I do have is one of the worst mix out there of the song, so I'm still looking. ""Didn't I blow you Mind"", was the only song that the band recorded live together, and I love strings, but they leaked into Earls drum set and had to be lowered, and it's the only Delfonics record where the strings are too low for me, though this version is better than any previous ones, the strings are to far in the mix and I was expecting a miracle I guess. I got the CD on the 1st day it was released and I'm glad I bought it. I'm no expert, but some of these songs sound like they recorded at a higher digital rate. If you have these Delfonic songs on a CD already, you may not notice any difference, but if you have pretty good ears or thought you knew every note or sound in these songs and want the best versions of these song recorded, then this is a must buy. I don't know if this guy had the original tapes to work with, but he somehow got rid of the musicians talking in the beginning of; ""Think about me baby"", and someone's enthusiasm on ""Trying to make a fool of me"" after the music intro, maybe Thom Bell? I give the album a A.",1467331200,5

81158,4277,15256,"I think Dave Mustaine has arguably again matched the classic album ""Rust in Peace"" but even moreso than with ""Endgame"". This album, ""Dystopia"" sounds like it could fit in between ""Rust in Peace"" and ""Countdown to Extinction""  and to lesser extents ""Peace Sells"" and ""So Far"" at times with the way that it sounds but there is so much musical complexity and excellent songwriting and musicianship here. Dave Mustaine's voice also is wonderful on here; I prefer it to any other album he's released I think. He layers it but has a powerful, rough delivery and sometimes has harmonies mixed in lower which sounds cool. The songs themselves are each amazing in their own right and there's even an instrumental that is up there with Metallica's best ones (Orion, Call of Ktulu)). Megadeth definitely breaks barriers as far as guitar work is concerned here. This is some of Dave Mustaine's best guitar work and composition to date in my opinion. I know hype often disappoints but if you are a Megadeth fan or even a metal fan, I think you will love this album. It is a masterpiece and I am glad that I got the version that allows you to order a vinyl copy. I'm also glad that Dave could put something like this out for the younger kids and show them what true metal is (I think Slayer did a great job with keeping things going too with their new one even with a new guitarist and drummer). If you are kind of iffy about the band because of record like Risk and World Needs a Hero, never fear, ""Dystopia"" is here. Recommended!",1467331200,5
81159,15193,16773,"This was my first time buying one if their albums. Overall, I enjoyed it. The dual vocals work well with this group. It is mostly a laid back album with a few more electric songs. I really like the female's vocals. She has a great voice and compliments the music well. On ""Defector"" the only way that song could be better is if they sang more of it and of course her vocals.

She is going in more of a pop direction.  But her songs are still being played on country radio.  I don't like this cd as much as the ones before it.  The title song Red is a good song about all the different emotions of a relationship.  And I have always thought she was a great writer.  She really has a gift especially to be so young.  We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together is maybe my least favorite song of her's.  It is over the top.  22 is good.  Everything Has Changed and Begin Again are my favorite songs.  I wish she would go back to her roots.  But this cd sold about a zillion copy's then she went full fledged pop.  Her older songs are still getting played on country radio.  so I guess I'll have to settle for that.,1467331200,3

81186,1726,18162,"Active in LAs live music scene, Carla Rigolin Hassett performs as a soloist or leads a trio and quartet that perform bossa nova, jazz, and Brazilian popular music. She won an Independent Music Award nomination in 2010 for a track that she produced and performed with Mike Patton (Faith No More). While Carla was finalizing production on +Blue she continued to perform in Los Angeles, teach at the Silverlake Conservatory of Music, produce other vocalists, and is earning a degree in music production from Berklee Online.

According to Carla, I was born in So Paulo, but really I was raised in Chicago. My father transferred to Chicago when I was very young and the original five-year plan turned into a permanent situation. I grew up in a very Brazilian household, surrounded by the thriving Brazilian community in Chicago, who were my aunts, uncles, and cousins growing up. As I evolved from mostly background and session singing to finding my own voice, I discovered that embracing my Brazilian heritage and allowing it to musically mesh with my American self was the key to my uniqueness. Ive benefitted with more work and a deeper feeling of artistic satisfaction. Im also a bit of a nerd and feel comfortable with the technical side of music. I have a small, but well equipped studio in my home and often record myself remotely for producers, composers, and songwriters. Ive also produced, recorded, and edited vocal sessions for other singers on record projects and films. I think being a singer with recording and engineering skills gives me an advantage over non-vocalist producers. A couple of songs on +BLUE reflect the constant back and forth between the two countries and cultures, Sem Calor and We Belong Here.'

The tracks are as follows:

We Belong Here
Pois &Eacute; E Tal
Guerreira Vai
Sem Calor
Ladeira da Praa
Sangue da Terra
A Little More Blue
Forte
Quando Me Desamericanizar
South American Way

I honestly though ""Bored To Death"" was a great single but there are only a couple other songs that are as good like that on this thing. Can I blame Mark and Travis for wanting to find a guy that is willing to show up to their gigs and actually carry the band forward? No, I can't. However, that means this band is always going to get flak for not having Tom til the end of time and all their records are going to sound like +44 albums under the Blink-182 name. There is fun to be had on this album but it only comes in small doses. I wouldn't say this is a true representation of Blink-182's work as a music group.",1467331200,3
81191,15194,6968,Beautiful neo soul song.  I can't help but think of this ginger guy I was crushing on when I hear this song. I'm black though and this is qualifies as nice mellow jam,1467331200,5

81193,2728,16816,Maxwell music is always soulful and enjoyable.,1467331200,5
81194,4505,18042,"Elizabeth Cook can sing!!! She has a voice that begs to be heard. This album is not classic country music by any means. She's country rock with a blues beat at times, but not that modern country pop garbage. Her lyrics definitely have a classic country music theme. (Think of the last verse to David Allan Coe's 'You Never Called Me By My Name"". She hits on pretty much all the important topics at once point or another.) But her overall sound is all her own.

Cook's doing something really cool here. She's not playing by anyone's rule. She does whatever sound she feel like and she makes it work. This album is well worth checking out.

There is a ton of energy in this album that's almost held back, so the whole time it feels tense like it's about to explode. It's a really cool feeling. Hopefully that makes sense. If not, listening to it and you'll see what I mean.

 Exodus of Venus - WOW! From the very first beat of the song, WOW! You can almost feel yourself at her show with the opening beat of this song setting the tone of the concert. The vocals kick in after about a full minute and then...WOW again! She has got a voice!

 Dyin' - Did I mention she can sing? She's doing it again here. Her band is a little more subdued behind her on this track, but with her voice that's not a bad thing as all. The lyrics are amazing too. This whole song is amazing.

 Evacuation - This one sounds a little more Southern. Her voice brings in a twang that she doesn't have earlier on the album. This is not a bad thing at all. She sounds even better here. The song is about getting out of Louisiana because a storm is coming. At least that's the overt theme. This one, in particular, has that tense energetic feeling to it that I mentioned above. It's a really cool track.

 Dharma Gate - This one is a slow song focused on the vocals. Cook sounds great, but the lyrics didn't really do much for me. Neither did the music behind her. This isn't a bad song, but it's one of my least favorites.

 Slow Pain - Now this is how you do a slow song! I feel like I haven't been clear enough how amazing Cook's voice is. This is the perfect track to listen to for hearing how well she can sing. And her lyrics are phenomenal here. It's hard to go a really slow song with this much pent up energy. I don't know how else to explain it. This is a great track!

 Straightjacket Love - Her twangy voice is back, almost to bluegrass levels. And she works it!! Once the band starts going on this track it becomes bluegrass rock (Is that a thing? Screw it. It is now.) This song has a unique sound that is amazing. She keeps going back and forth between really slow solos to a really jammin' full band. It's one of the best tracks on the entire album.

 Broke Down in London on the M25 - This one is more rock music with country vocals....set in London. (She's doing her own thing, that's for sure.) It's another cool song with a great sound. This is definitely a theme here. We're at track 7 and there's only 1 song I don't like so far.

 Methadone Blues - This song is literally about going to a Methadone clinic to get medicine that helps detox from heroine or other opiate drugs. Cook's got a history with drug problems so this one is pretty personal. I've never been a drug addict but I've worked in a Methadone clinic. She definitely captures the overall experience. It's a great song.

 Cutting Diamonds - This is one of the more bluesy tracks on the album. Is 'blues rock' a thing? Again, Cook's not playing by anyone else's rules. She's making the sound she wants. She's doing it right. This is a great song. It's about some personal demons that gets pretty deep.

 Orange Blossom Trail - This song sound older, if that makes sense. It's a good sound. It's a good mix of county vocals, rock beat, and blues guitar. So it's highlighting everything Cook and her band do well. It's got a great beat to it too.

 Tabitha Tuder's Mama - She slows it way down to close out the album. It's a vocal show here with very mild instrumentation. This is a beautiful song that once again really showcases how well Elizabeth Cook can sing. This is a classic county slow song. I know I said at the beginning that she's not classic country, but this track shows she's fully capable of doing it when she wants to.

The short version here is....go listen to this. Elizabeth Cook is amazing.",1467331200,5

81206,9150,18164,"Wolf Hoffmann (Accept) returns with another solo outing of classical music in a metal vein.  The first outing, Classical, was a fine smorgasbord of classical arrangements interpreted for metallists.  This second outing is similar.  It rocks.  It roars.  It redefines a lot of classical pieces by Mussorgsky, Mozart, Tchaikovsky, Beethoven, et al.  Although a ""solo"" outing, Mr. Hoffman (or Wolf, if you prefer, or even Mr. TheRealGeniusBehindAllThoseIncredibleAcceptAlbumsForTheLastThousandYears) is ably assisted by a live orchestra, from Prague, currently in the The Czech Republic.

If you like laid-back classical music, sorry but this is not really for you.  This is for metalheads who love rock symphonies. (And count me in as one of them.)  Listen to this loud.  And often.

You'll hear traces of Accept songs in many of the tracks on ""Headbangers Symphony"" (or least the influences of these songs on Wolf Hoffmann and thus on Accept's music), e.g., the opening track, Beethoven's 9th Symphony ""Scherzo"" is reflected in the incredible ""Teutonic Terror"" song on Accept's ""Blood of the Nations"" album.

81211,1409,7608,"I've been a Pvris fan since 2015, a year after this thing came out but this the first time I got around to writing the review. This record is quite simply magnificent. Few albums in any genre, and especially these days in alternative pop/rock boast a full tracklist of consistency and at such a high quality standard. Its like getting an album that is three quarters singles, if that makes sense. Pvris once used to be a metalcore outfit, and I have faith that the metal they recorded was probably pretty darn good but I am so happy they made the swap. This is a stunningly good debut.

Lynn Gunn is a star on the album, but she combines with Alex and Brian to create some really unique electropoprock backing instrumentals that you cannot help but notice over her vocals. She sounds sort of like a hybrid mix of Halsey with a touch of Lauren Mayberry from Chvrches, and I think this album is above both of the ones released by either aforementioned group. My personal favorites are Smoke, My House, and Holy (stunning vocals on the chorus). This album is really beautiful to listen to and as long as you know what you're getting, I urge an instant buy or download.",1467331200,5

81215,4505,18163,"I enjoyed this. Yes, they sound a little different than they did back in the day. You know what other band sounds a little different 20 years after their debut? ALL OF THEM!!!!

If you want to hear Blink 182 sound exactly like their did in the mid 90's, go get the Cheshire Car and Dude Ranch CD's. I promise you Blink 182 will sound EXACTLY like they did back in the day on those albums. It'll be like you took a ride in a time machine. Science!!!!

If you've grown up at all since 1995, and are willing to let your favorite bands grow a little as well, I think you'll like this 2016 album. It's a little different, but it's still them. The song themes are a little more mature, but then so am I. (I said a LITTLE more)

 Cynical - The beat really gets you going. The lyrics are pretty awesome as well. It's got a theme of ""what's the point"", hence the title 'Cynical'. It's a good song.

 Bored To Death - The lyrics here are really good. It's all about that feeling where nothing gets you excited, no matter how interesting it actually is. The chorus includes ""Life is too short to last long"". That sounds kind of dangerous...but then isn't life more fun that way? It's a really cool song. And the music rocks.

 She's Out Of Her Mind - The vocals are more prominent on this track, which works well because Matt Skiba is awesome. The song is one that anyone who's ever dated anyone is going to relate to pretty well. The whole song is awesome and is one of my favorites on the album.

 Los Angeles - This one didn't resonate with me. Maybe that's because I've spent a grand total of 24 hours in LA in my life. Maybe I just don't have the background to get it. The music wasn't particularly my favorite either. It's not a bad song. It's just not working for me.

 Sober - The theme here is ""I messed up bad because I'm drunk. I would like to take a recess from this argument until I am sober enough to properly defend my moronic behavior."" That's the verbose version, but it pretty well explains it. As long as you're not currently in or suffering from the effects of a seminal situation it ends up being pretty funny. And the music is awesome. It's a great song on this one.

 Built The Pool - The whole track is 16 seconds long. It will.....catch you off guard. Then you will laugh.

 No Future - Liked the music. The lyrics didn't do anything for me. Neither did the overall sound of the vocals. Overall this was one of the few 'misses' on this album for me. But music is a funny thing...you might think it's the best song ever and wouldn't be wrong.

 Home Is Such A Lonely Place - This is a much more mellow sound than the rest of the album. It's a beautiful song. The vocals are fantastic. The lyrics discuss a really dark situation with a relationship that isn't what it once was. It's sad, but beautifully done.

 Kings Of The Weekend - From the first riff of this track, it's awesome. The lyrics are all about having a great weekend that's so awesome it might kill you, where you are in charge of your own destiny for 48 hours unlike the rest of the week when responsibility is in charge. This is a great song to start your weekend with! (It's Friday when I'm listening to it for the first time. It's putting me in the right mood)

 Teenage Satellites - The vocals are put through a weird filter that I'm not loving. But the band is rocking it. The song is cool. It's one of my least favorites on the album but I don't hate it.

 Left Alone - Sounds really cool. They do a vocal harmony on this one that's working well. The band sounds great. The lyrics are really well written but aren't going to resonate with everyone. Even if the words don't reach you, the sound is awesome and it's still a good track.

 Rabbit Hole - The song opens with ""Dear Head, shut up."" It hooked me right from there because I can't recall how many times I've been in that mood, where I don't want to do the smart responsible thing. Sometimes I just want to react emotionally and not worry about the consequences!! This song is about that. And the music sounds great. This ended up being one of my favorites on the album. I love this track!

 San Diego - I've spent a lot more time in San Diego, but that wasn't what made me like this one. This song isn't really about the city, so much as the memories the singer has there with someone he once loved. San Diego is a euphemism for a happier time with an old love that he can't go back to. I've spent a lot of time in that San Diego too. This one resonated with me. It sounds awesome. Its' a great song.

 The Only Thing That Matters - I think this album is getting better towards the end because this is another one of my favorites. It's got a happy upbeat theme about a great love making everything right with your world. The music is probably the fasted paced on the album. It really gets you moving. It's another great song!

 California - They slowed it down for this on. The band takes a very back seat to the vocals here. It's very mellow music (I wasn't sure Blink 182 knew how to do that) It's a great song. It's beautifully sung. It's all about imagining the perfect life.

 Brohemian Rhasody - It's 30 seconds long. It's got one line. It's funny.

All in all, listen to this. Enjoy it.",1467331200,5

81221,12591,17639,"I agree this one is going to have different reactions for different fan types.  This album is more accessible, that is true - but do you really want King Diamond screeching on a track and ruining it anyway?  For me personally, I never liked that song with King Diamond on it. I tried to like it, but I always skip it. And the other really heavy track ""Evelyn"" or whatever is goofy and hard but for no real purpose.  I skip that one, too. (These comments refer to earlier releases).
So this new disc suits me fine.  My wife can't get it out of her cd player, she loves it so much.  I think Volbeat achieved what they wanted to for this album.  The song with Danko Jones on it is killer!  'Battleship Chains' tops the original by Georgia Satellites, as well.  So what if this album is more geared towards the ""Lola Montez' and ""Cape of our Hero"" fans.  If you fall into that category, you should buy this as soon as possible.",1467331200,4

81263,2674,15309,"Oh my, this was a fabulous album! I've been a Replacements and Paul Westerberg fan since the mid-1980s and will buy anything he records. Truly, one of America's finest singer-songwriters. I'm not that familiar with Juliana Hatfield but know enough about her own musical legacy to appreciate this pairing. And it certainly did not disappoint. The power, the glory, the hooks, and oh that beat. Shake it!

Speaking of shaking it, let me start with 3 song that WILL get you out of your seat and dancing around the room or pulling chunks of foam out of your mattress: ""Wear Me Out Loud"" ... ""Whole Lotta Nothin'"" and ""Done Done Done."" Think about ""Sticky Fingers"" era Rolling Stones merging with ""Let It Be"" era Replacements, and you have a good idea of the ""wow factor"" in these songs. Nothing but smiles when I hear this stuff.

And there's more great tunes where those came from, especially the album's mesmerizing closing track, ""Hands Together,"" and songs such as ""King of America"" and ""Dance to the Fight."" The album is much more Westerberg than Hatfield, at least as far as the lead vocals go, but the two appear to mesh well as musicians. The only disappointment is the lack of information in the liner notes: no songwriting credits and no list of musicians. In fact, if you don't know the details already, you wouldn't even know that Westerberg and Hatfield are the ones behind this great recording. What's up with those omissions? I guess it's cool to be mysterious, but a bit of detail would be appreciated.

Cut to the chase: this album give you 16 tracks that either rock your socks off or soothe your soul. This is the power of rock and roll and I'm a believer!",1467417600,5

He definitely worked hard for this album and it shows. He took a completely different direction than what his fans are used to listen from him and i think that's partially why he called this album ""new level unlock"".

Like that they kept this album EXPLICIT .

This album is very different from his previous ones (EP) and while it might not please hardcore dancehall fans (with a typical beat and lyrics) , this album is very pleasant to listen . It goes from more pop-ish songs , to hip hop-ish  to more ballad-ish ( yes i add ish because you still have that jamaican/dancehall feels to it )

While i did not enjoy every single song in this album ( sorry), i enjoyed a vast majority of it .

81284,1219,18173,"Very disappointing...no better than the latest Barren Cross. Excellent musicianship, but nothing fresh to offer and extra boring music. I don't know what happened to this band they just keep getting nowhere. If you want the best albums, then get these if you can find them. Rock In Victory(1984), First Watch(1989), Fire and Love(1996), The rest are very lacking and at times you wouldn't even think this was the same band.

81296,12631,7602,"The Cowsills were an extremely talented and highly popular family recording act hailing from Newport, Rhode Island. The band scored several hit records in the late 1960's. The Cowsills specialized in tight harmonies and began performing and recording at a very young age. The group consisted of brothers Barry, Bill, John, Bob and Paul, little sister Susan and their mom Barbara. Their meteoric rise to the top of the charts was the inspiration for the hit TV show ""The Partridge Family"". The Cowsills had three local hits in 1966 that got the attention of the folks at M-G-M records who signed the band in early 1967. Several months later The Cowsills released their first single for M-G-M called ""The Rain, The Park & Other Things"" (you might remember it as ""The Flower Girl"") which made it all the way to #2 on the Billboard charts.

81309,1484,6483,"What kind of person listens to this? This god awful dreadful ""song"", IF you can call it that, sounds like a whining cat, or a child being spun around and then sent through auto-tune to create the worst sounding thing possible to the human ear. Take strong note that only 6 people here have rated this song above 4 stars so far, 6 people whom are either tone deaf, completely deaf, or took part in the creation of this song and want it to make money somehow.

How much is this [profane words cannot be said on Amazon to describe this song] record company throwing at radio stations to ram this song down listeners necks? This gets my vote so far for worst song of 2016.",1467417600,1

81315,10170,15452,"I have been a Dream Theater fan since 1997 and like most of my fellow fans, I bought this one on the day that it was released. I only listened to it twice all the way through at the time and have not touched it until now, giving it it's third thorough listening for this review.

To give you a perspective on my own tastes, I gave up on them at Train Of Thought and did not take another look at them until A Dramatic Turn Of Events. I hate Train Of Thought so much that I refuse to own a copy. So if you hate Train Of Thought, you will probably like this one,  and vice versa.

Reading a description of the story had me grimace because it is utterly ridiculous. John was indeed inspired by Game Of Thrones and Star Wars. However, it comes off as a bad imitation of the great Arjen Anthony Lucassen. Somehow, the vocals of James Labrie and the musical compositions manage to pull it off and save it from total disaster. It is not the band's fault that old folks like me often have the attention span of gnat and have no desire to sit through 34 songs that mean absolutely nothing at all to them. I still applaud them for this great effort.

On a positive note, it is still much better than the drek being played on the radio these days. Also, once it is made into a movie or play, it will gain them a new group of fans while losing some of their old ones.",1467417600,3

Today in 2016, so many artists come and go, but Christina had so much unbelievable talent.  All of the songs are amazing.  There will never be another Christina Grimmie.

81335,2571,13516,This is Terri Clark's cd of classic country songs.  It seems like everybody is making one of these cds sometime in their career.  She does some of these songs as duets with the original artists.  Like How Blue with Reba McEntire and Delta Dawn with Tanya Tucker.  The songs that were originally made by female artists like Love Is A Rose work better then the ones done by male artists like Gentle On My Mind.  I have every cd Terri Clark has made.  And am a big fan of her's and will continue to buy her cds.  This is a pretty good cd.,1467504000,3

81340,56,17221,"It honestly is surprising that someone whom has a lot of talent has lost it with having her voice, and that is very rare that someone can have that happen. Unfortunately, for Meghan Trainor, I have not been pleased with the set of songs she had came out with on her second album, Thank You. When I first heard the song No, I was not only not pleased, I found it to be a weak gamble for her to follow into Britney Spears territory with her voice. Somberly, with a lot of the tracks I had heard from her Thank You album, like I Love Me, I felt she was losing her voice at the soul. Her latest single, Me Too, the third from her Thank You album definitely is not a strong suit for her. She does bring some of her voice back she had on her past songs like Dear Future Husband, but overall, I still was not impressed overall with the work and I think Meghan does need to find better than what she made out with Thank You. Perhaps when her third record comes out, she can have more from her own voice to flow than met the eye, and heard from the soul.

Song: C-",1467504000,3
81341,3546,1154,I have listened to and analyzed this mp3 and feel it is a faithful edition of Elvin Bishop's hit.

81348,18,18180,"Bat For Lashes is the stage moniker of British singer-songwriter Natasha Khan. Has it really been 10 years already since she seemingly came out of nowhere with her accomplished debut album ""Fur and Gold"", which was one of my favorite albums of that year. Since then, BFL has released only 2 more albums, taking her time to bring ""Two Suns"" (2009) and ""The Hanuted Man"" (2012. Now, after yet another 4 year lay-off, an eternity in the music industry, comes BFL's 4th album.

""The Bride"" (12 tracks; 47 min.) turns out to be nothing short of an ol'  fashioned concept album, bringing us the story of a bride-to-be whose fianc is killed as they are on their way to the wedding ceremony, and what happens in the aftermath. The album opens with ""I Do"", a dreamy tune showcasing Kahn's warm vocals, The album is front-loaded with the better songs, check out the haunting ""In God's House"" (1st UK single), the up-tempo ""Sunday's Love"" (2nd UK single), about as mainstream a tune that you will find on here, and also the breezy  ""Honeymooning Alone"" (yes, our girl decides to push on with her honeymoon, alone!). As the album unfolds into the second half, the songs slow down (it's not like they were super-fast to begin with), re-enforcing the dreamy aspects, with a lush orchestral touch on many of these tracks. Comparisons with Lana Del Rey's most recent album (coincidentally called ""Honeymoon"") come to mind, check out for example BFL's ""I Will Love Again"". The story ends with ""In Your Bed"", marking a swift turnaround of the grieving bride-to-be. (On the European version of the album, and also if you by the MP3 download instead of the CD, there is a bonus track called ""Clouds"".)

Bottom line: this is a beautiful album, but certainly not for anyone in a hurry. Bat For Lashes has been on my ""need to see"" list since the debut album cam out, but sadly she does not tour the US very much (no US dates have been announced yet for later this year) and when she does, it's typically East and West cost, not the Midwest... Thus BFL remains on my ""need to see"" concert list. Meanwhile, ""The Bride"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1467504000,4

81351,11681,16876,"After his first album, Sturgill Simpson was often referred to as a modern day Waylon Jennings.  A Sailor's Guide to Earth shows however that if you were to compare him to another country artist, a modern day Dwight Yoakam might be more appropriate.  Much as Dwight Yoakam's albums This Time and Gone greatly expanded what sounds a country album could include, this album does it again 20 years later.  The fusion of R&B, country, soul, and whatever other genre strikes his fancy is absolutely brilliant.  I was hooked as soon as I heard Sturgill was releasing a country concept album.  Like great concept albums before it, it has a great flow to it, and the whole is much greater than the sum of its parts.  There aren't a ton of songs that stand out as his greatest songs ever, but it is easily my favorite album by him.  Also, the album cover is absolutely beautiful.  This album has both resurrected the album as an art form and the art of the album cover. The cover shows why an album cover should be more than just a thumbnail on a phone screen, it is a work of art.",1467504000,5

81371,9069,11775,"Having gained notoriety from the two tracks that appeared on the recent, excellent Nick Drake tribute compilation, Way to Blue:  The Songs of Nick Drake, Luluc offers its sophomore release Passerby, a full-length echo of the duos Drake takes.  The duo of Zoe Randell (voice, guitars) and Steve Hassett (voice, guitars, bass, flute, mandocello, percussion, and keys), sets a near-ambient mood, augmented by thirteen guest musicians favoring classical string instruments on several tracks.  Overall, the albums hushed elegance envelops the listener in Randells quiet musings on life, love, and the pursuit of melancholy.  Passerby is the sound of snow falling, a pen scratching out an overdue letter, an acoustic guitar playing softly in the next room, a soundtrack for those fleeting moments between dreams and daylight, or nightcap and nightlight.",1467504000,5

Fortunately, those songs and most of the other ones on this soundtrack were very good. A most worthwhile purchase. The 3 Buckingham tracks, especially the radiant ""Brother & Sister"" are top-notch tunes. The tunes by Graham Parker are also very good with ""What Do You Like?"" being the standout track. The songs by Paul Simon, Loudon Wainwright III, Ryan Adams, Wilco, and the Avett Brothers are also very strong ones. Really, the only tracks I don't care for are the ones by Yoko Ono and Fiona Apple. Take away those two blemishes and you have yourself an outstanding collection of music.",1467590400,4

 Poulsen has  a strong voice with great range and control , he could probably sing opera arias , He should team up with Rob Halford for a few duos.

81409,6363,465,"So, I both love and hate this song.  First, I love the moody music and the singer's voice.  And even though I hate them, I also love the lyrics.  If I seem conflicted, it's because it's a sexy, fun song...until you really listen to the words.  The singer of this song is saying, ""I've got a girl crush"" but really, what she has is incredibly low self-esteem and wishes she were another girl because she thinks she's in love with that girl's boyfriend.  I mean, really think about that.  Instead of this woman saying to herself, this guy likes ""long blond hair"" and ""[her] smile and the midnight laugh"" she might as well be saying, ""I hate my short, brown hair, I hate my crooked teeth, I hate my high-pitched voice.""  It's a song about self-hate and wanting to erase who you are to be that someone else that some guy likes.  That is a terrible message for girls, and any woman to internalize.

And then, there's the whole stalker-y aspect of the song:  ""Thinkin' about her under your bed sheets""  and ""I wanna taste her lips, yeah, 'cause they taste like you"" and then the ""I want everything she has.""  It's a little creepy - very ""Single White Female"" if you've seen that (terrible) movie.  Again, not really a message you want girls/women to have.  You shouldn't want to be another woman, and you shouldn't obsess about or try to be another woman.  You should learn to love yourself, be comfortable with who you are, and look for men (or women, or both - whatever your preference) who appreciate and WANT you for that.

So, again, I love this song, it's my favorite workout cool down song, but would I want my children to listen to it?  Hells no.  Lest we think the lyrics don't matter, I would argue that all messages (music, TV, movies, video games, books, etc.) sink in and become a part of how our kids think and see the world.",1467590400,3

81411,12631,5607,"Think back to the music scene in the mid 1960's and to all of that energy! There was music by The Beatles, the British Invasion and all those dynamite tunes being cranked out by Motown. But there was another group on the scene that somehow managed to crank it up yet another notch. Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels exploded onto the scene in late 1965 and over the next 18 months had a fabulous run of raucous, driving hit records that included ""Jenny Take A Ride"", ""Sock It To Me Baby"" and a driving remake of Bill Medley's ""Little Latin Lupe Lu"". The granddaddy of them all however was the group's 1966 hit ""Devil With A Blue Dress On & Good Golly Miss Molly"".

81414,4745,17859,"Another Bach Guild Big Box Set winner!  As has been noted by other reviewers, you won't find much Debussy or Ravel here and chamber music is also absent but otherwise you have a wide ranging survey in generally good to excellent sound.  A couple performances have appeared in other Big Boxes - Elman's Lalo and the Gilels Saint-Saens Piano Concerto #2 (which, BTW, is the only recording that seriously sounds its age, probably late 1940s or early 1950s.

Some of the highlights - Berlioz does very well, with a collection of overtures conducted by Alexander Gibson and a Symphonie Fantastique under Charles Mackerras that is notable for including the repeats in the 1st and 4th movements and the cornet parts in the 2nd movement.  The tympani are also impressively recorded!  Saint-Saens also is well represented, with a bang-up Organ Symphony performed by Sergiu Commisionna and the Baltimore Symphony (why did the last movement get me to thinking of a BLT?), a delightful Carnival of the Animals and the 2nd Piano Concerto.  Philippe Entremont and the Denver Symphony contribute a collection of French chestnuts, including the Sorcerer's Apprentice and Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun.  Bizet is represented by the Symphony in C, Jeux d'enfants, the Suites from L'Arlesienne and a few orchestral minutes from Carmen. The Lalo selections are also quite enjoyable and I really like Ronan O'Hara's Satie (BTW his contributions to the Big Schumann Box were among the highlights of that collection.

I can't see myself returning to the early music too often but there's more than enough here to keep me occupied.",1467590400,5

I downloaded it afterwards and at first I thought, finally, here is a song that respects women and talks about a guy having found the one, not feeling tempted by other women, and being ready to settle down. BUT...upon further listening, I realized all the things he likes about this woman are that, ""she gives me love and affection"" and ""she is always right there when I need her.""  There's nothing about what he does for her.  His mom approves of her, so all that's left for him to do is ""pop the question.""  I know, I'm probably being nitpicky, but really, what does he do for her on a regular basis?  Is he her cheerleader too?  Does he give her love and affection?  It's very one-sided.  So, it's a really catchy song and fun to workout to, but...I'm still searching for a pop song by a man that has a good message for/about women.",1467590400,3

81480,12631,11038,"When Hank Williams wrote ""I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry"" he intended that the lyrics be spoken as opposed to being sung as he had done on several other of his early recordings. Ultimately the decision was made that Hank would sing the song and ""I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry"" was released as the""B"" side of ""My Bucket's Got A Hole In It"" in February 1949. C&W deejays discovered the song anyway and it quickly became a favorite on Country radio and a staple of Hank's ""live"" shows. Still a large segment of the record-buying public remained unfamiliar with the tune. That all changed in 1966 when a young pop-country singer from Texas named B.J. Thomas re-imagined the song for mid-60's pop audiences. ""I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry"" by B.J. Thomas and the Triumphs would race all the way to #6 on the Billboard Hot 100 in April of that year. For my money this continues to be most moving version of this song ever recorded.  This is the original hit recording you would remember from the radio.",1467590400,5

Its very pop synth to the extreme, with some metalesce imprints. Now if you like this band, as I am a fan, will find this disappointing. Now I know there was a level of turmoil within their ranks and one member left. I can speculate its the direction of the music. Few good songs, but comes up very short with what this band has .",1467676800,3

Well, SHE DID IT!!!  K. has moved far beyond the LOVE & HIP HOP ATLANTA brand that she could have played it safe and remained, but she wanted more and she gave it!  Her voice is as powerful as her personality, and even when she's rapping, I approve, because it's from a place deep inside her and it makes you believe in her stuggle.

81614,11892,17137,"Where Butterflies Dance is the latest album by piano artist Ann Sweeten, recorded at Imaginary Road Studios and co-produced by long time music legend Will Ackerman.  As the title would suggest, this is a very relaxed recording, and is at times lively in only a very gentle and somewhat fragile way. Overall, the recording is very serene, but don't mistake that to mean it's slow or uninteresting. The tempos are often medium to brisk in nature, and Ann uses her left hand to create an ever present pattern of  fluttering arpeggios throughout the album. Simultaneously she uses a very gentle touch at the piano, rarely moving beyond a loud volume for anything more than a few bars.  Add to that the calming sounds of the flute, acoustic guitar and violin, and you have a recording that is something that can be harnessed as music to relax to, or used for more engaged listening.

The first of my preferred tracks on the album is Elysian Fields.  This one sticks out as being unique in that the nature of the piece is very ethereal, and it's really the only song on the album to capture this quality.  The piano playing is very steady and consistent, and behind it we have some very wet vocal synth pads, which are a combination of guitar sounds by musician Jeff Pearce, and synth chords performed by Ann herself.  Together this creates a very ambient feel inside of a piece that really isn't ambient at all, as the piano playing is much too structured for that.  This combination is really lovely, as it alternates and improvises between two major chords (E, back to D, and then back to E again).  I don't know how else to describe this but as structured simplicity at it's finest, and the mixture of all of the above makes it my absolute favorite piece on the recording, hands down.

Next we move on to a very different sounding track, Veil Of Tears. This piece has many different musical elements interspersed throughout, and the use of these elements creates something very interesting to listen to.  We have several different types of seventh chords that are used, often the major seventh, but these chords are combined with some dark and moody chords as well (the piece is actually written in A minor). Musically, that's a brave move, and is something that's not heard very often at all. What it creates is a very thoughtful, reflective piece that's almost reminiscent of something written by the great impressionists, and simultaneously brought completely up to date in it's approach. One can see butterflies of every color painting a vibrant picture in this piece.

Finally, let's have a look at Where Butterflies Dance, the title track on the album.  What we have here is a song that stands out in the way it's approached musically, a gentle waltz with a left hand stride pattern. Once again, Ann uses her own musical influence to draw upon and creates something out of the ordinary.  Much of the time, waltzes place an upward emphasis on the final count in each bar (3), leading back to count one.  Ann does not do this, so what we hear is a pattern of  strong-weak-weaker, and back to strong again. This is a subtle but very powerful distinction, as it changes the entire feel of the song in regard to a waltz. The right hand plays a gently improvised melody over top of the chords, with the sweet sounds of the flute and violin playing off of each other throughout the piece. The result is a lovely combination that doesn't place you as the listener on the dance floor, but sets you aside as a spectator, one who is able to take in every element of a beautifully elegant waltz as an observer.

Ann Sweeten has done a wonderful job of putting together a recording that offers a lot of reflection, introspection, and musical picture painting. It's very easy to listen to and uncomplicated, making it a perfect pairing for most occasions, whether they're public or personal. The title is very appropriately named, as it fits the feel of the recording very well and is all that one would expect from an album titled Where Butterflies Dance.",1467763200,4

Would I recommend tho, that is the question? I think I'm leaning towards no. Go listen to a few songs for free then decide. I'm picky about how I spend, so I'm not recommending. I like a few songs but to purchase all songs, verses I'm going w purchase a few songs. I'd go w purchase a few songs.

81637,1751,17914,"MAGMA is an excellent album from the French metal band -- less complex this time around, yet retaining their distinctive sound, which began as death metal some years back.  I am not a fan of death metal, so this is fine with me!  Guitarist/vocalist Joe Duplantier and his brother Mario, the drummer, built their own studio in NYC where they did the recording.

The album is well constructed, with diverse alternating moods and styles. The opening ""Shooting Star"" is slow and brooding, and is followed by three powerful and heavy songs -- ""Silvera,"" ""The Cell,"" and ""Stranded."" The instrumental ""Yellow Stone,"" which sounds Celtic, provides a breather before another powerful trio -- ""Magma,"" ""Pray,"" and ""Only Pain."" ""Low Lands"" is more reflective, with a lyric that seems to be addressed to the band's namesake:

""in all there is to learn
the sun is on our side
and though you're on the run
you will survive

expanded to the state of light
the deepest corners of the world
gliding through the lowlands
and swimming all the oceans

while you drift away
from all the plagues of this world
you're put out of misery, giant
monster""

I'm only now catching up with the band, but it seems clear that Gojira is building a bigger and bigger following, expanding beyond the extreme metal underground like a monster headed for the center of the city! In that sense they seem to be on the same sort of trajectory as Mastodon, another giant monster also breaking out of its cage.

Clearly this is among the best hard rock and metal albums of 2016.",1467763200,5

81677,56,17798,"These days, when I do think of great songs, there are just so many of them in today's generation, that really are thoughtless, and show a lackluster appeal that don't strike serious awareness to the soul that are just so deep that do mean more than met the eye. For Phil Collins, he has had so many great songs over the years that have really stood very hard at the soul, whether it is divorce like he felt with his marriage ending that helped him make In The Air Tonight, or spoke at the somberness of the soul and speaks of love, like You'll Be In My Heart from Tarzan, which won Phil a Oscar. But of all of his songs, the one that really does take a stand in regards to how people look at the homeless in society as carpetbaggers, and invisible people. That is the case with Another Day In Paradise. The song which came from his 1989 album But Seriously, still is one of the deepest songs at the soul. It really strikes on how the homeless are viewed in life, where they can't have happiness or a future brighter than the abrupt and selfish world we live in. The song today still stands just as strong and serious from the soul overall, and is one of Phil Collins' deepest masterpieces in song. If you had never heard a Phil Collins song before, than this is one I sincerely recommend.

81696,12631,7018,"In the summer of '65 I turned 14. It was virtually impossible not to be mesmorized by the sounds eminating from my little Radio Shack transistor radio. The Beatles were at the height of their popularity and Motown was churning out one memorable tune after another. I went on vacation with my parents for two weeks in mid-July and when I returned a couple of hippies I had never heard of---Sonny and Cher--had several records on the charts!! It was difficult to decide which 45's to buy with the limited resources from my paper route. It was about this time that two rockers from Long Island teamed up with two folkies from Greenwich Village to form what would become the Lovin' Spoonful. They would become one of my all-time favorite bands. The debut single ""Do You Believe In Magic"" quickly raced up the charts and became a Top Ten smash.

While listening to these songs, i couldn't help felling like maybe he's cramming too much into one song and that at times he seems to be all over the place with the harmonies, melodies and rhythm but he's 21yrs old he's probably just excited and eager to show his skills .  Everyone mentions his talent as a multi - instrumentalist but listen to the tone of my mans' voice....now that's a MAN singing to ya !

81749,524,18105,"""Sacred Visions"" is the sixteenth album in twenty-three years from master harpist/composer Peter Sterling. The music for the album was created during a two-year period of intense creative exploration. Sterling has been a visual artist for most of his life, working largely in stained glass since the age of sixteen. He recently discovered a unique way to photograph his mandala- and yantra-like windows with a special kaleidoscopic effect, calling the project the Portals of Light Series. One of these beautiful and colorful creations graces the cover of the album as well as the CD itself. Sterling sees Sacred Visions as a synthesis of sound, geometry, color and the patterns that open ones soul to the beauty and brilliance of the divine cosmos! In addition to electric and acoustic harp, Sterling performs on keyboards, guzeng, recorder, ocarina and percussion as well as vocals. Guest artists include Bruce Becvar and Robin Miller on guitar, Hans Christian on cello and sarangi, Richard Hardy on soprano sax and native flute, and William Aura and Craig Dobin of 3RD Force  on bass and piano - longtime friends that Sterling has worked with on other projects over the years. Sterling describes the process: This music was built upon some world beat percussion grooves of tabla, conga, and marimba in order to give the music a unique and right rhythmic line. Further explorations with samples and loops helped to bring in some amazing voices to this music which ranges from sanskrit mantra, african chant and a touch of RnB! A interesting mix for sure!! For sure!

""Sacred Visions"" begins with Sedona Sunset, a gently rhythmic piece that sets the mood of the album. It is also the first piece in the opening trilogy, which was inspired by the red rock and spiritual traditions of that area. The mystical Shamans Cave follows, blending harp, guitar, native flutes, bass, chanting voices, and ethnic percussion. Starlight and Moonbeams completes the trilogy with harp, vocals, an easy-going beat, and some hand-percussion that imbues the piece with a sense of fun. While were on the subject of fun, Bombay Boogie combines chanting voices with a danceable rhythm and East-Meets-West instrumentation. Eclipse slows the tempo a bit with a gorgeous slow-dance that borders on smooth jazz. Sterling refers to this piece as a mid-record deep groove exploration and its my favorite on the album. Thru the Valley and Over the Hills is a warm and tender piece with a sweet, simple native flute melody the flows over gentle harp rhythms and harmonies - also a favorite. Remembrance closes the album with an obviously very personal piece that combines harp and cello with grace and deep emotion.

""Sacred Visions"" is a stirring and inspiring musical experience that soothes the spirit while it uplifts and relaxes. Recommended!",1467849600,5

81778,12631,13521,"Back in 1968, when I was 17 years old, most of my contemporaries were into music by people like Jimi Hendrix, Cream and the Rolling Stones. While I enjoyed all kinds of music, my preference during that time was for much tamer music. In the summer of that year, The Vogues released ""Turn Around, Look At Me"" a remake of a relatively obscure Glen Campbell tune from several years earlier. I immediately fell in love with the song and the group. The Vogues had been around for awhile, having achieved significant chart success on Pittsburgh's Co&Ce label with songs like ""You're The One"", ""Five O'Clock World"" and ""The Land of Milk and Honey"". But this sound was different. Fifties rocker Ernie Freeman had become the producer/arranger for the group. His combination of lush production values and impeccable harmonies produced an incredibly pleasing sound that proved wildly successful. ""Turn Around"" was a huge hit for the group and was followed in swift succession by remakes of ""My Special Angel"", ""Earth Angel"", ""Till"", ""Moments to Remember"", ""Green Fields"" and others. I bought every one of these singles. In fact, I enjoyed The Vogues so much that I used to even play the flip sides frequently.  Here's to one of the best records they ever made.",1467849600,5

81796,12631,6231,"Just when it seemed that Gladys Knight and the Pips had vanished from the scene forever they emerged on MCA in 1988 with an unexpected hit called ""Love Overboard"".  What a great record!  I guess a lot of people agreed because ""Love Overboard"" was not only a substantial hit on the R&B charts but it also peaked at #13 on the Billboard Hot 100 pop chart.  In addition, the song won Gladys Knight & The Pips a Grammy award for ""R&B Vocal Group"" of the year. Quite an accomplishment for a group that had been around for 40 years. I think you will agree that ""Love Overboard"" is one of the funkiest songs the group ever recorded.  Definitely worthy of a full five stars!",1467849600,5

81821,56,17785,"This past year so far, 2016 we've have lost a lot of legends that really did know the strength of making great music with the losses of David Bowie and Prince. But also, we've seen a few legends really come back into the music industry after leaving the industry for personal matters. With Phil Collins coming back after retiring and re-releasing his catalog, many fans have really rediscovered his brilliance and talent as a musician, and a noble solo songwriter. But that has also been said to with the great Paul McCartney in his own legacy, with him re-releasing his solo collection of songs and what he did with Wings and other projects on his own, the legendary Beatle has really shown a lot of joy with people revisiting his solo work. But unfortunately, it is also a year of deviating sadness for Paul, with the heartbreaking death of legendary Beatles producer Sir George Martin, whom guided him with the fab four, and his solo efforts abroad. Paul has had some sadness, but with him releasing a career-spanning box set of his works, after The Beatles, and a new tour on the horizon for Sir Paul's brilliance, his solo work in tact just as strong as The Beatles and even broader alive and well. But for his work, the question is, Is Paul McCartney still relevant and strong? Yes he is.

Pure McCartney is a career-spanning collection of Paul McCartney's solo hits. There are two collections of this album, deluxe and regular, but this will focus on the 4 disc deluxe collection. The collection of his solo works is a strong ans distinctive reflection of McCartney's work with Wings and and his solo work that does display how brilliant Paul's gifts in song have been strong and show a nobly deep reflection of his great solo career, over 45 years of the making strong. The songs have all been remastered well, and show a lot of Paul's genius well from classic tracks like Maybe I'm Amazed, Let 'Em In with Wings, as well as newer hits for Paul that have been not as strongly recognized like New, No More Lonely Nights, Dance Tonight from Memory Almost Full and Sing The Changes from 2008's work The Fireman. The collection does highlight Paul's own work well, but the collection does have a few setbacks in play. First, Pure McCartney does overlook a few of Paul's biggest hits from his career and standout songs that Paul are richly distinctive like The Girl Is Mine with Michael Jackson, Ever Present Past, the theme song Paul did for the movie Spies Like Us, Freedom which Paul composed from Driving Rain in regards to the tragedy of the 9/11 attacks and a few other classics. Not only that, but second, the collection is not in chronological order, where it can be more confusing for new Paul McCartney fans, that are just getting into his music for the first time, not though for die hard fans of Paul's greatness.

Despite a few flaws, Pure McCartney is a very good buy for both die hard Paul McCartney fans, as well as newcomers that have never heard a song Paul McCartney had ever done before. this collection shows that Paul's legacy is still alive and well, and just as richly, widely celebrated as well as his work with The Beatles. It has been a legacy worth celebrating in every way from one of the world's distinctive and curious songwriters that is worth its money. I have always loved why Paul McCartney's classics are just as strong today, as they were back then in the 70's, 80's, and 90's, etc. I absolutely recommend this compilation a lot. We'll still say Maybe I'm Amazed, well we're amazed well with this album.

81824,15283,18217,"Sinoia Caves is an electronic side project by Jeremy Scmidt of the Canadian retro-psych/prog/rock act Black Mountain. Basically Sinoia Caves is to Jeremy Schmidt what Synergy was to Larry Fast. Anyways in 2002 the first Sinoia Caves release came out, The Enchanter Persuaded (before anything from Black Mountain appeared), it was released privately, but once Black Mountain started recorded and making their presence known, that one was re-released on Jagjaguwar, in which Black Mountain recorded for, and it included a bonus track not found on the original. As years went by, I pretty much gave up on the idea of a new Sinoia Caves release, but I guess Black Mountain taking up so much of Schmidt's time, I'm not too surprised. In 2010 he scored for a Canadian film Beyond the Black Rainbow, but for some reason the soundtrack did not get released until 2014, four years after the film was originally released. Anyways, I find this a great improvement over The Enchanter Persuaded (which to be fair, was still very good). The music has, unsurprisingly, a soundtrack-y vibe to it. It's basically in the vein of John Carpenter, Tangerine Dream's soundtrack albums, Goblin, and Klaus Schulze. Schmidt is a serious analog freak and he doesn't appear to touch much any keyboard made past 1982, full of analog synths, plus Mellotron and even Hammond organ. Most of the music sticks to the 3-4 minute range, but the highlight for me is the 16 minute ""1966: Let the New Age of Enlightement Begin"", a rather ironic title if there ever was one. This is a very doomy, eerie, ominous piece, you won't be thinking of sunshine pop in the vein of the Association or some flower power psychedelia. This has a rather orchestral feel, although all played on synths. There's really eerie drones and an eerie vocoder passage. There's even parts that got me thinking of Cluster's Cluster 2 (1972) album (if you only know what Cluster did starting with Zuckerzeit, their early stuff is much more eerie). It's a bit strange that the lengthiest piece on both Sinoia Caves albums are the eeriest, as ""Sundown in the New Arcades"" demonstrated on The Enchanter Persuaded.

I have finally seen the movie in question. I guarantee you mainstream movie viewers will probably not enjoy this. The film rarely goes much a faster pace than 2001: A Space Odyssey. It involves a telekenetic teenage girl held captive in a facility by some madman, who attempts to escape. It's not easy to watch, and is quite disturbing, and the music is certain to match. I am not entirely certain I'd want to watch this again, but luckily I rented it. At least the music is fantastic and I highly recommended to all lovers of old school electronic music.",1467849600,5

81841,15285,15155,"Truly a work of art.
I got into electronic and trailer music through Instrumental Core music and Really Slow Motion.  When searching the ""Other Worlds"" album, this one was a related result, the words ""pulse of life"" and the album artwork drew me to it and i found it on youtube, listened to the one song, then another, then I purchased this due to the inherently higher quality of the audio I would receive.  I cannot say how pleased I am with this purchase and once I get payed, I will be buying more albums.
On this album so far (as of 07/07/2016) these are my 3 favorites in order...
Track 17 - Written in the wind
Track 11 - Deadfall
Track 14 - Pillars of Eternity
I also recommend the purchase of real headphones with this soundtrack, not those ""in ear"" jokes of headphones or the laughable Beats by Dre, i mean real headphones.  I have the NVX XPT100 headphones and I guarantee you have not heard music in its complete until you've used those.

81849,12631,15793,"They have been wowing audiences now for nearly six decades.  The group was formed in Brooklyn, NY in 1957 and was originally known as The Chesters.  Just a year or so later they changed their name to The Imperials and ultimately to Little Anthony and the Imperials.  Led by lead singer Anthony Gourdine the group would make some of the most memorable R&B singles of the early 1960s.  Perhaps the best known of these is the moving Goin Out Of My Head from 1964.  I think we can all relate when Little Anthony cries out I see you each morning, but you just walk past me, you don't even notice I exist.

81862,3424,18219,"After following Chevelle for the last 15 or so years, they have finally developed into a mature and experienced band. Their early albums are killer, in the middle my interest was wavering as they seems to lose direction and two years ago they released La Grgola which was a huge come back and fantastic album. Now we have The North Corridor, and only after a few listens it appears that Chevelle may have released their finest and tightest  album to date. This is just some brilliant music if I do say so myself. It is most definitely up there for best album of the year of 2016.",1467936000,5

81888,6816,17846,"I have been a big fan of Switchfoot since ""Learning To Breathe"". I have been listening to this album for a week already as I preordered it. ""Where The Light Shines Through"" is a strong album from the band. I personally like it better than ""Fading West"". Those who are hoping to a return to the grunge rock sound of ""Hello Hurricane"" and ""Vice-Verses"" will be disappointed. While there are a couple rock tracks, most of this album is alternative pop. There are several highlights though. Holy Water, Float, Where the Light Shines Through, Shake This Feeling, Live It Well are great songs. ""You Won't Let Me Go"" is my favorite song on the whole album, and maybe one of the top five ballads in the history of the band. The album does seem a bit disjointed, and does not have a musical theme like Fading West did. Gone are the hard rock songs, and this is why I only gave it 4 stars. I have it as my 5th favorite Switchfoot album behind 1. Beautiful Letdown 2. Vice-Verses 3. Hello Hurricane 4. Learning To Breathe.",1467936000,4

But I was kind of doubtful about him doing country music.  Then when I heard this I was really surprised.  He does these songs just as good as he does any thing else.  These are classic country songs like Let It Be Me, Love Me Tender Please Help Me I'm Falling and I Cant Stop Loving You.  And I was especially surprised at his version of Southern Nights.  The intro music isn't as good As Glen Campbell's but the way he deliver's the song is just as good as Glens.  This cd really surprised me.",1467936000,4

Immediately, I thought, okay, now she's totally cute, but what does she sound like. Shallow I know. Whatever. I listened to clips of the two songs available at the time, A Love Song and Let it Roll and I was floored. Loved them! I pre-ordered Wild Things right away and then scooped up her debut and Anxiety. I've listened to her debut now about 5 times through, Anxiety about 10 and Wild Things at least 10 or more. This album is everything I love about music, solid bass, nice rhythm, awesome voice and lyrics, all done up very nice and neat. Perfect. Sad I missed out experiencing Ladyhawke as she came on the scene but am completely happy that I found her now. I'm a fan for life. And she really is adorable.

81929,4505,11610,"Okay first off, if you are offended by literally anything, just skip Aziz Ansari's comedy and spare us from your review that says ""Oh my god I had no idea there would be the 'F' word on in this act. It's deplorable!"" You don't want to hear the dirty jokes. We don't want to hear you complaining about the language or the topics or anything else. So just skip it and we'll both be happier.

Now that we're past that petty nonsense...

This album isn't as funny as Ansari's 2012 release ""Dangerously Delicious"". It you have to pick just one, pick that one. But this one is still good. (Just not AS good). There are moments that it's absolutely hysterical. The bonus track about the day he met Obama is enough to make a statue laugh. So is the whole track about Grindr.

But some of the tracks are just humorous, not hysterical. It's worth a listen, but it's not going to have your rolling on the floor the entire time. There's also track 3 about being the cutest kid of all time were the act quickly devolves into child molestation jokes. There is just no way to make that funny. Those kind of jokes are usually put into a comedy act for shock value as a joke to the comedian to see how uncomfortable he can make the audience. (They play these games. Watch The Aristocrats. They'll explain it all.) But it's not good entertainment for an audio CD. Keep in mind, ti's 2 minutes of a roughly 60 minute album. It's not worth skipping the rest of the set for.

His strength is that he's not talking about crazy themes or politics or anything deep and heavy like that. His entire act is all either about normal daily living situations or crazy implausible situations that are still possible.

All in all, worth trying out. Skip track 3. You'll laugh hard at times, and chuckle at others. You won't be bored.",1467936000,4

81937,4505,18025,"I thought this entire album was really well done. It's not going to be the next White Album, but it's really good.

The Felice Brothers have a somewhat unique sound. The vocals sound a little like Bob Dylan. The band is a mix between bluegrass, country, blue, and polka (I only say polka because there is an accordion in the mix on some tracks. And it's done well and works. They don't make the mistake of 'too much accordion.) And they rotate the different styles and work them together in different combinations so all the tracks don't sound alike.

Plunder, for example, is more upbeat and a blues / pop mix.
Aerosol Ball does more of a polka / county sound.
So there's two examples of songs with totally different styles, yet still clearly the same band. All if it sounds cool.

Triumpf '73 reminded me instantly of a song called Dead Flowers recorded by Townes Van Zandt. (You may recognize that version from The Big Lebowski Soundtrack) If you know that song, you get an idea of the sound here.

One of the really neat things about this sound is that it sounds older. It doesn't sound like it was recorded in the modern era. It sounds like you should be listening to it on a 60 year old vinyl record. There is just something about it that if you told me it was recorded in 1960 I would have totally believed you. (Aside from the one song tile with '73 in it.)

This it not party music by any means. This is music that would be perfect to put on after the party winds down at about 2am so you can just feel the music in the night.",1467936000,4

Only listened once, but can tell it will be played a lot. Really liking this. A must buy for any Chevelle fan of prior material, but also for those who never gave the band a real chance, they should start here. Its a hungry sounding, heavy, yet total Chevelle experience. Can tell the band took their time on this one. Went for the jugular for the most part, though does have its melodic moments for balance. These tracks will really come off well live.

A must buy. They are a underrated band that has been delivering quality stuff for quite a while now. I have purchased all their stuff and appreciate their consistency, but this one is filled with ALL keepers. Excellent.",1467936000,5

81969,128,18230,"Strange Music fusion group Mayday has become exquisitely popular in hip-hop circles in the last several years due in no small part to its four man panel of highly creative musicians but also due to the two emcees in the band, Wrekonize and Bernz.  Of both men, Wrekonize started his single-man career first, releasing one LP in 2010 and then another in 2013, but now it's Bernz' turn to shine solo.  See You On The Other Side, Bernz' official debut studio album (July 8, Strange Music Inc), is a less than ecstatic hip-hop goodie made by experts and professionals of their craft, but before anyone goes into the project, they should know that while it is structurally hip-hop to the core with plenty of bluesy cool productions and toe-tappable beats with solid vocals of course (including some from other Strange Music artists), it drips with melancholy, poignant pensiveness and heavy feelings of helplessness from its big filled-to-the-brim cup of coping elixir, metaphorically speaking.  It's for the mopers.  Be warned.  It lacks a good measure of positivity, powerful charging resolve and resoluteness, but if you take with a grain of salt all the gloomy despondency found nearly everywhere on S.Y.O.T.O.S., you'll be just fine.

""Came To Say Goodbye"" offers disillusionment before possibly the album's best cut overall, ""Outta My Brain.""  Atlanta lyrical wizard Jarren Benton joins Bernz to deal with life frustrations over fast catchy guitar strums.  It's a real banger for the summer or anytime, venting and letting all its burdens hang out, with swagger and great showmanship.  ""Smoke and F"" is dedicated to Bernz' dream girl, ""Dancing With The Devil"" to living on the edge, and ""Chasing Shadows"" to general malaise where the philosophical nihilism is directed at dissing the everyday capitalistic grind and bloggers among other things.  The sadness continues in ""When It's Gone,"" this time because of no faith or confidence in a relationship, and then MURS, who is great, makes a few remarks in ""Bed Of Nails"" to the effect that critics build artists up waiting for them to fall, which in virtually every genuine case couldn't be further from the truth.  MURS just released a masterful LP in 2015 called Have A Nice Life so how could anyone wish hard times on the man for it?  It was a great sincere gift; however, part of the whole staged attitude of the song feels a little scripted to service its theme.  His dislike for critics might be exaggerated to an extent for the track.

Moving on, we get some cynicism in ""Vicious"" with an uncredited feature from Thirstin Howl III and then some feelings of disapproval in ""It Don't Go.""  ""Call Me In The Morning"" drinks and smokes when the troubles stack up (hopefully not to destruction) and the next and last three songs though still kind of down and out tend to chill and mellow a bit so things don't feel so nasty once the finale ""Sunday Sin"" comes through pumping and pounding in the music so we can all clap our hands and nod our heads.  Bernz is a good rapper and emcee for his class here bar none, not out of this world, but very much respectable, yet to some people, his all-original rhymes might seem to be at too intermediate a level, in the casual delivery he often uses.  The themes, topics, tropes and subject matter could benefit from getting out of the house, but then again they are a reflection, analogy and address of these days' very hard times and concomitant disenfranchisement.  SYOTOS' greatest life lines are its solid music and guests though.  It's definitely a rap album one hundred percent but maybe not a technically mind-blowing or jaw-dropping one from a lyrical standpoint, plus it's incredibly depressive which hurts somewhat.  Overall, and as far as hip-hop albums are concerned, the final verdict for Bernz in See You On The Other Side is - good.",1468022400,3

When I got into the office, I brought with me my studio headphones and boldly faced my manager who's face was red with anger, I just said ""just listen to one song"" and turned on the first track.  10 minutes went by, and then I heard it, this music, being played over the intercom.

82056,56,17221,"It is so hard whenever someone who is talented, that unfortunately, they just haven't been able to sincerely to find their voices again, after their first record. For Meghan Trainor, her first album had some really good songs, but when it had came out to her second album, Thank You, I would have to say that I am very distraught that she has not really been able to drive her work further, where as the case with a lot of the songs like, No & I Love Me, I really was not hearing a stronger sound from Meghan that really drove her voice in her work. She really did throw people a hard hit, where her songs are not as strong in where she could've gone. Me Too, her latest single from Thank You, really doesn't deliver. She really delivered more of a sound that really showed she is a shell of herself. I was not very thrilled at how she had been delivering her work lately, and she delivered less in the drive of the song. Perhaps Meghan should not try and follow into Beyonce' or Rihanna territory. It really isn't Meghan suite at all.

82071,4400,18233,"The production of early Cradle of Filth material has always been flawed in one manner or another until Midian arrived, so I took listening to the original Dusk and Her Embrace with a grain of salt and zero expectations. The commercial release of Dusk in 1996 has an atmospheric sound all its own and while the drums and bass don't get a lot of love its still the pinnacle Cradle album with the songwriting and dual guitar melodies at the their creative and conceptual apex.

The Original Sin's mix is much more spacious and sounds live-in-the-studio to me. There is significantly more presence from the bass guitar and drums and as noted in a lot of other reviews, Dani's vocal performance is more guttural (actually quite similar to his performance on Hammer of the Witches - the guy still delivers the goods). Some of the keyboard sounds on Original Sin are a bit cheap and toyish sounding at times but the string melodies are fantastic. The guitars sound more coarse and dry on this version again sounding like they were fed straight into the mixer from a live performance.

Missing entirely is that thick blanket of atmosphere found in the Music for Nations version. The biggest perks of this 1995 recording of Dusk is hearing the bass guitar up front in the mix. That and an amazing vocal performance from Dani, which I think fits the music a tad better than his shrieking on the 1996 release.

The problem with the Original Sin (and something that was completely unavoidable given the circumstance) is that the remastering has crushed the remaining dynamics and when the music is at its busiest it sounds like mud. It doesn't have the clarity and crispness of the Music for Nations version. This is because the band only had a single left/right stereo DAT tape of the record, and not the individual tracks. That means no ability for a proper remix and since they remastered an already murky sounding recording, the additional compression has made Dusk a chore to listen to. That, and I don't think the tracklisting of the 1995 version flows as well as the commercial release.

Malice Through the Looking Glass is a glaring omission replaced with the original version of Nocturnal Supremacy, a Cradle favorite which fits better nestled in the middle of V Empire. Heaven Torn Asunder is and always will be an album opener, with that classic sound of the Earth splitting open and the threatening guitar lines signaling whats to come. The new album art for Dusk is absolute photoshop tripe like their last several releases. The mystique and anachronism of the original album art perfectly encapsulated the theme of the music contained within - but with this new art it just cheapens the experience.

Ultimately, hearing the Original Sin actually makes me appreciate the 1996 version even more. I listened to it again after a few spins of the Original Sin for comparison and you know - the production is just fine and I think recording a better version was the right way to go as the sound and atmosphere of the Music for Nations release is what catapulted the band into the mainstream to begin with. I'd be surprised if anyone would replace the version we've known and loved for 20 years for the Original Sin. Just because it sounds more raw doesn't necessarily make it an improvement and in all honestly the remaster did nothing improve what was already a muddy aging DAT tape.

Worth a listen as a a historical look into the tumultuous early years of Cradle of Filth and their raw recordings - but in no way essential as the Music For Nations release will always reign supreme.",1468022400,3
82072,8994,17914,"I have always listed Gojira as one of my favorite metal bands, yet I've realized that I don't listen to them much. I like their music, but in some ways it is just too exhausting to listen to for any prolonged period. It's heavy, bludgeoning and usually kind of a downer lyric-wise. Maybe I'm just getting older, I don't know. With Magma, Gojira has made the perfect album for me! For one, it is relatively short with only 8 ""real"" songs, several under the 4 minute mark. But mostly, this is ""easier listening"" Gojira - not to say it's not heavy - it definitely is, but there is more room to breathe, there are breaks from the action and for the most part, clean vocals. This album was self produced and recorded in their new studio in NYC and definitely still sounds like a Gojira album. I knew that the subject matter was about the Duplantier brothers losing their mother to cancer, but I generally don't listen too much to lyrics, so didn't think that would affect my impression of the album. Well, it's hard not to hear what's going on lyrically and my take on Magma, is that it is in many ways a concept album. You can hear the shift amongst fear, anger, sadness, resignation and ultimately, peace that the brothers experienced while dealing with their mother's illness. ""Low Lands"" is the most obvious of the bunch - near the end of the album, it is a sweeping, haunting, majestic masterpiece that carries a ton of emotional heft. Joe is asking his mother to describe the afterlife, ""Tell me what you see, when you are everywhere"", and you can imagine a spirit flying across the earth, seeing everything at once. It is heartbreaking, yet also comforting and at least for me, hopeful. The title Magma perfectly describes the energy of the album - not a huge explosion, but more of a hot, propulsive force that oozes and bubbles out of the speakers. There are machine gun riffs on ""Pray"" that sound very Meshuggah-like, and some squeals used in the verses of ""Only Pain"" and ""Stranded"" that pay homage to Dimebag (maybe?). The title track has some really cool pinch harmonics in the verse that give it an otherworldly sound - Joe mentioned to Guitar World that he may have a hard time pulling this one off live - we'll see! The overall sound is more straightforward than other Gojira albums - not a lot of wacky time changes or over the top guitar antics. The focus is on the songs - the writing is more mature and streamlined than on previous work, and it seems as though the brothers Duplantier are not interested in showing off their chops, they want to simply make good music. Mario Duplantier is arguably one of the sickest metal drummers on the planet - the guy is ridiculous. On Magma, he plays to the song - not a lot of flashy fills or crazy polyrhythms for the sake of letting people know he can play. Listen closely though, there is a lot of subtle stuff going on that is pure genius - things that may seem deceptively simple, but probably only Mario could ever have come up with. His drumming on ""Pray"" is absolutely hypnotic, just awesome. It is often more impressive to me when a guy with chops can restrain themselves and focus on enhancing the song - there's nothing worse than overplaying when it is inappropriate. Mario nails it here - can't say enough about him. In summary, this will certainly divide Gojira fans - some will complain it's not heavy enough and too mainstream and not death metal enough and the vocals aren't growly etc. Those things are all true, but the bottom line is that this is Gojira, they are good, they make good music and write good songs, so if you can appreciate their efforts and take the time to let this one sink in after 4 or 5 listens, you may come around to acknowledging that no matter how ""heavy"" this is, it is still worth listening to.",1468022400,5

82082,56,18234,"Throughout the past several few decades for Disney, they have had excellent movie songs that have really stood the test of time, in regards to the warmth and brilliant heart that have grown with our children, and their children with time and deep beauty that has been magic with Disney for years. That has happened with movies and songs like The Lion King with Circle Of Life, Toy Story with You've Got A Friend In Me, and with Aladdin with A Whole New World. But I was very surprised that instead of a new song for Disney's Finding Dory, they would instead of having something newly written, they would instead choose to do a cover song for the film instead, breaking Disney Tradition overall. When I had heard that Sia would do a rendition of the classic Nat King Cole's song Unforgettable, I found it to be overdrawn, and lacked so much of the heart that was brought out on the song from Nat, and also his recently departed daughter, the great Natalie Cole whom made the song her own 25 years ago. Natalie did more justice to the song than Sia did overall. Sia brought in too much orchestration, without having a lot of the soul and charm the song had for generations already. If you're a fan of Finding Dory, than I suggest you give the song a shot, but otherwise, just stick with the one Natalie and Nat King Cole did that have stood the test of time, and still do today. Maybe she should've had more that brought out on Sia's chandelier.

Today I write this renewed in the belief that Paul is much more than a Beatle.  Sure, there are complaints as to what was left off, but I could care less.

The songs sound streamlined, a little too poppy, without enough of the hard edge or humorous wit that was such a staple of earlier releases. Though I was not a huge fan of self titled, I could appreciate the experimentation and still felt it was a fairly solid offering. Even Dogs Eating Dogs was better than this one. The biggest problem with California is that it lacks replay value and feels very stale after just a couple of listens. The bite is gone, and in its place is an unassuming growl, similar to the sounds of All Time Low or The Click Five. The NA NA NA thing gets really tired too, and doesn't work to any advantage what so ever. If there's one silver lining here it's that Mark's vocals are still top notch. It may be just my own preference but I always enjoyed his singing more than Tom's.

California is good for a spin or two, but it ultimately lacks any of the charm that made their late 90s, early 2000s releases so memorable. Everything about this record suggests the band was aiming for a cross between TOYPAJ and Enema Of The State, but California ultimately fails to live up to either one by a long shot...",1468108800,3

82109,7538,15278,"I cannot believe this.  Eleanor Friedberger's New View is an incredible album.  Really tight vocal melodies from a songwriting point of view (maybe that's the refreshing new view Eleanor's referring to!) and the emphasis on personal feeling is evident throughout the whole album.  I can't find a weak point!  ""He Didn't Mention His Mother"" and ""Sweetest Girl"" are probably my favorite songs with ""All Known Things"" not far behind.  I really get the sense Eleanor was in a personal mood when writing this *very* strong material.

The guitar parts are often dreamy in a Bob Welch-era Fleetwood Mac kind of way, Eleanor's voice reminds me of Russell Mael of Sparks fame (odd unintentional coincidence I'm sure) and the arrangements are entirely tasteful.  Perhaps some of the songs repeat a bit (such as the line ""Why would you wanna do that?"" in ""Because I Asked You"" or the line ""But if you'd ask me I wouldn't care, and if you'd met me I'd be there, but if you'd let me I wouldn't dare"" in ""Cathy With the Curly Hair"") but who cares.  The emphasis on melody and personal feeling wins me over HUGE in that regard.

I'm pretty picky when it comes to new music because usually I'm unable to feel attached to the music (for example that junky, repetitive commercial singer/songwriter stuff I hear while grocery shopping- don't know who any of those artits are but they seriously stink very badly and someone quickly needs to turn the volume down right away because they can't sing!) but this album is truly worth listening to.  None of the complaints I have with the singer/songwriter stuff created nowadays applies to this Eleanor Friedberger album.  Eleanor's the real deal.",1468108800,5

82111,56,8327,"There are some songs that are just meant to be covered, where in this case there are some songs that had been worth sampling over time. When Ray Parker Jr. came out with the original Ghostbusters theme song, it was caught under innuendo and storms, with him using the Huey Lewis & The News song, I Wanna New Drug back in the 80's. But with time and space, the song has still been as iconic today, as it became a hit back then. When I had heard Fall Out Boy do a cover of this definitive song, Ray Parker Jr. & Huey Lewis got credit for in the 80's, and the original version isn't bad after all this time. It is definitely one of those movie songs that has still stood the test of time, in the way other movies songs like Purple Rain did for with the late great Prince and Footloose for Kenny Loggins as well. It surprisingly still shows a lot of longevity that is worth listening to, and much more worth the download for new fans of the upcoming Ghostbusters remake, and die hard fans of the classic films with Bill Murray & Dan Akroyd.

-""the extremist ""who think everything and anything she makes is a master piece ,everything is wonderful and if you dare giving it a personal critic they will come down on you hard saying you are a hater
-""the true hater ""who are the complete reverse. They hate everything and will go down hard after those ""extreme fans""
- the""regular"" fans , the ones who enjoy her voices, her work , her performances , her lives , her energy . Like some dislike some . Just because someone doesn't like it all doesn't mean they aren't true fans . We all support riri in our own ways.

Music is very subjective. We all have different taste . There is no need for all the rudeness here .

I m a ""regular fan"" of Rihanna . I love her energy. I love her voice and let's say it ,this girl is drop dead gorgeous and have a stunning body. At 28 years old she looks more beautiful than ever . She is also very talented , an amazing dancer ( also amazing twerker) and has a truly beautiful voice . I ve been a fan of Rihanna since her debut and been listing to her music , going to her lives since than .

Sadly this is the one album from Rihanna i simply can't stand . TO ME  it felt more weak than her past albums ( maybe because i m used to her ""older ""stuff)
The music , the vibe was very slow and it felt like 16 tracks was simply unnecessary .

I was expecting something with more beat .

I am unsure if this album will be a turn in her career and she is trying to change from her ""classic style"" / rihanna signature  or if she is simply experimenting something new.
Also unsure if she put something out there because her contract said she had to . To me it simply lacked rihanna imprint on it

This album is a hit or miss depending the person. It at the complete oppositite of her past songs , music , vibes and style. I m glad some people enjoy it . I personally didn't . Its the first album i won't be listing to again .",1468108800,1

But that's what I believe the Avalanches intend for us to do here, as they did 16 years ago, and furthering that suggestion with some of the most downright fun music ever. Surely that's the only way we're intended to process things like the wholly misunderstood ""Frankie Sinatra"" or the extreme catchiness of ""Subways"": put our brains on sleep mode and just move.

I love this album. It is overwhelming in a way the tail end of ""Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite"" would likely have been to listeners weaned on the Monkees and Rascals and Motown in 1967, an utterly unexpected worldview, a landscape in sound that you simply can't process in one sitting. Individual tracks blur into a serial whole similar to channel-surfing or gazing out a window on a late-night drive, so long as your drive is through a place you have absolutely no knowledge about, adding the euphoric effect of wonder that can be derived just as equally from any mind-expanding experience as it is from the simplicity of a child's perspective. Is ""Colours"" a drug song or a kid's song? We don't have a standard answer, but we have our own.

There is simply no music like this out there and expecting it to retreat to the confined space of a review is sort of ludicrous. Maybe that's why the only reviews here are about the purchasing experience and not the music.

Formed in Newark, NJ and led by the incomparable Frankie Valli, The Four Seasons would be a dominant force on the Billboard Hot 100 throughout most of the 1960s. During that decade they would amass an impressive total of a dozen Top 10 hits including four #1's. One my very favorite Four Seasons sides is one that did not quite make it into the Top 10. Released in May of 1966 the rousing Opus 17 (Dont You Worry Bout Me) peaked at #13. Man, could Frankie belt out a tune in those days. Outstanding!",1468108800,5

Well, The Cyrkle was the only American group managed by Fab Four manager Brian Epstein. In addition, the groups wildly successful debut single was co-written by Paul Simon (who was living in London at the time) and Bruce Woodley of The Seekers.

82184,3003,16715,"California band Weezer have long been critical darlings in the alternative rock circuit. They cemented their legacy with their 1994 self-titled debut (Also known as ""The Blue Album"") followed up by great but commercially underperforming ""Pinkerton"". They took a five year hiatus before returning  in 2001 wit a series of albums: ""Weezer"" (Which, like their debut, was produced by The Cars frontman Ric Ocasek), the self-produced ""Maladroit"" and their biggest album to date - the Rick Rubin produced ""Make Believe"". They then returned with their third self-titled album (""The Red Album""), their final album for Geffen Records, the noticeably pop ""Raditude"" and their only album for Epitaph, 2010's ""Hurley"". After a four year hiatus, they returned to Universal Music Group one last time for 2014's critically acclaimed ""Everything Will Be Alright In The End"". Although the band has been a fan favorite, they have periodically angered them over their desires to make blatant pop music. Although, to be fair, frontman Rivers Cuomo hasn't shied away from his love of pop records. In fact, he frequently cited the Beach Boys founding member Brian Wilson as a primary influence on his songwriting. So, it should be a surprise to no one when Weezer decided to make an album influenced by the beach - hence their fourth self titled effort. Known better as ""The White Album"", the album could have been referred to as ""The Summer Album"" due to the album's cover and the overall theme of having fun in the summertime. Joining them for the production of ""Weezer"" is the producer Jake Sinclair, who's no stranger to pop music - having produced albums for the pop band Five Seconds Of Summer.

Despite not being a concept album, musically, the album plays out like a love letter to a summer weekend in California. The album starts off with ""California Kids"" about having a good time. On the song ""Wind In Our Sail"", Rivers sings of a couple being happy alone sailing the seas.  On the celebratory anthem ""Thank God For Girls"", they work in a sample of ""Trilogy"" by little known prog rock band December's Children. ""(Girl We Got A) Good Thing"" recalls the sound of 70's AM radio while celebrating the fact that romance blossoms between a couple. ""Do You Wanna Get High"" details a man reluctantly agreeing to engage in excessive drug use with a female friend. On ""King Of The World"", a man wishes to have a fun time with his female friend despite all of the negative things going on around them. ""Summer Elaine And Drunk Dori"" as well as ""L.A. Girlz"" recall Weezer's earlier work while they sing of a man's emotional conflict over his new love on the pop friendly ""Jacked Up"". They close the album with ""Endless Bummer"", where a man regrets being in a relationship with a much younger woman. Their self-titled fourth effort may lean towards pop, but this time around the band got the balance right to please their fan base, music critics and the mainstream audience. Nearing 25 years into their career, Weezer show that they still have it and can bring their best work when they are focused. This album - as well as their previous album - can hold up well with their best work...not an easy feat for many, but Weezer definitely made their case here.",1468108800,5

82190,524,17438,"2016 is the centennial celebration for the US National Parks, and ""National Parks Soundscapes"" is a collection of original pieces by Jill Haley that were inspired by twelve of the parks in the system. It is also a thank you to the Park Service and a reminder that we need to be diligent in ensuring that the parks are preserved for generations to come. Over the past several years, Haley has released ""Mesa Verde Soundscapes"" (2014), ""Zion and Bryce Canyon Soundscapes"" (2012), and ""Glacier Soundscapes"" (2010). Four of the pieces from those three albums appear on this album and the other eight celebrate the beauty and splendor Cuyahoga Valley, Badlands, Acadia, Shenandoah, Yosemite, Grand Canyon, Everglades, and Valley Forge National Parks. Haley is probably best-known for her distinctive  English horn and oboe playing on many of Will Ackermans productions, but she is also an accomplished pianist and composer. In fact, ""Mesa Verde Soundscapes"" was awarded Best Piano Album with Instrumentation by the Zone Music Reporter in 2014. It is interesting to note that this National Parks series has been something of a family project with Haleys husband, David Cullen performing on guitar and bass, daughter Dana Cullen on horn, and son Graham Cullen on cello; Tony Deangelis also appears on percussion and snare drum. Haley performs on piano, English horn, and oboe. The CD package also includes a wonderful 15-page full-color booklet with photos Haley took at each of the parks.

""National Parks Soundscapes"" begins with The Ledges, a tribute to 300 million year old sandstone formations in a hemlock forest. Both graceful and soaring, piano, English horn and light percussion paint a vivid picture of this area of Cuyahoga Valley National Park. Prairie Grass Dance is a wonderful duet for English horn and guitar (plus bass) that suggests vast open spaces and the movement of wind through the grasses - I love this one! In Waters of Acadia, the piano expresses the flowing movement of water while English horn plays a peaceful melody over the top. Shenandoah Stillness is a duet for piano and guitar inspired by the profound quiet of this park - another favorite! Towers and Kivas, a spirited trio for guitar, bass, and english horn, was a favorite from the Mesa Verde album. Mariposa Sanctuary was inspired by walking among the giant redwoods in Yosemite while sunlight was filtering through the branches - always a magical experience! This piece features Haley on piano, English horn, and oboe. Sunrift Gorge (Glacier) picks up the tempo a bit with a joyful trio for English horn, guitar, and bass - and yet another favorite! A Soldiers Sacrifice is quite different from the other pieces. It begins with a solo snare drum that suggests a battlefield. Piano and English horn express the sacrifices made by so many at Valley Forge - a very stirring tribute and memorial!

If you have heard and enjoyed any of Jill Haleys National Park series, this is a collection that you have to have! If you have enjoyed visiting any of our National Parks, you will love these soundscapes! If neither of those fit your description, then you really need to get this album to discover what you have been missing! Very highly recommended!",1468108800,5

82211,1577,10740,"One of my favorites from The Purple Rain Soundtrack. This song is fast, and it has that coming at you live feel. I would recommend this song to anyone, especially those 80's music lovers.",1468195200,5
82212,15323,17882,"Well Season 4 of Nashville hasn't been released on DVD out here in Australia yet but I decided to get this album anyway since they have been so hard to track down in the past.  Even without having seen Season 4 which would no doubt make me like some songs more since you can relate them to memories from the show, I have to say I think this is my favourite of all the season soundtracks. Usually there's at least one or two songs that I'm not that fussed on but I actually like all the songs on this one. These albums have come a long way since the Juliet Barnes, Ranya James mostly filled Season One Volume One album.  We've got a variety of actors/singers on Season 4 Volume 2.  Even one I'm yet to see on the screen Cash Grey (Jessy Schram) who sings a duet with Maddie Conrad.

The album starts off with a Luke Wheeler (Will Chase) solo Can't Say No to Love.  I haven't necessarily liked all of Wheeler's songs on the show but this isn't a bad one.  Something about going too deep and loosing control.

Then we've got a really powerful slow sad ballad song by Layla Grant (Aubrey Peeples) with Avery in the background (Johnathan Jackson).  I have to say I didn't notice Avery in the background the first time I heard it, but he's there.  In this song Layla sings about being the soul survivor of some event.  Now as I've said I haven't seen this season yet so I don't really know what happens, but this is a great song.

The third song is a Scarlett O'Connor number (Clare Bowen) that is a fast string strumming number.  She never thought she'd give in now you're underneath her skin.  Could be about a dude, the state or maybe a brand of whiskey. I'll have to wait to find out when the DVD comes out.

Then we've got an Avery Barkely fast lyric solo (Jonathan Jackson), more spoken than sung really but a lot of fun.  Well it says on the album back cover this is a solo but it clearly has a female voice in there too.

The fifth song is the one I mentioned with a new character Cash Grey and Maddie Conrad.  It's probably the best song featuring Maddie Conrad.  It sort has a swaying to the music vibe to it which suits the fact it's called Swept Away.

Will Lexington (Chris Carmack) has the sixth song with Moving on Never Felt So Good.  It has a fun intro with the guitar.

Deacon solos the next one (Charles Easton) with From Here On Out.  It's the most country sounding lyric wise of the male artists on this album.  Sounds like a song sung up on a stage.

The Rubble is the eighth song and is a Gunna Scott and Scarlett O'Connor duet (Clare Bowen & Sam Palladio).  It's a fast song a lot of guitar riffs.  About rising up after being knocked down.

Juliette Barnes (Hayden Panettiere) has her first solo at track number nine with Hole in the World.  It's a storytelling song, a sad song. Hayden has certainly become a great singer over the course of this show and it shows in this song.

Daphne Conrad (Maisy Stella) has a solo with track ten, Til the Stars Come Out Again.  This has a county fair band sound to it.

Track 11 Caged Bird is another Layla Grant solo.  Aubrey Peeples again shows she should have been used more on earlier albums with this one.  By the way if you haven't seen a movie called Jem & the Holograms you should check it out.  Peeples does a great singing lead actress role in that one.  Caged Bird is about having your wings clipped and realising there's a great big world outside and deciding you don't have to be a caged bird.

Juliette Barnes is back with another solo with track 12's One Place Too Long.  A bit of computer guitar sounds in the intro.  Hayden draws out the word Gone in this one, as in she's been Gone Gone Gone.  She can't stay in one place too long.

Will Lexington has another solo with Ain't it Beautiful.  This sounds closer to the stuff he used to sing in earlier seasons.  I don't want to give away what I think this song is about as if I'm right it would be a bit of a plot spoiler.

Maddie Conrad is back with a solo for track 14's Wild Card.  This is more of a mainstream sounding song than the more country sound we're used to from her.  It's got a fast drum beat and Lennon Stella has a very smooth sounding voice in this great track!

Juliette Barnes teams up with Luke Wheeler for Boomtown.  If you like the way penny's shine on the ground then you'll like this one.  Oddly Luke sings about two young hearts building this town which I take is supposed to be him and Juliette, but isn't he Rayna's age? Who in season one was the old fading age has been group in Juliette's eyes.  Still this is a great sounding song.

The 16th track is the first time Maddie & Daphne Conrad sing together with All We Ever Wanted.  About looking back when they were young and restless and all they ever wanted was love.  Probably the most grown up duet song by these sisters on all the albums.

The final track is the only Rayna James solo on here. In fact she's not even in a duet before this one.  Again I haven't seen Season 4 yet to know why this might be the case, but it's kind of nice she finishes off all the season albums and all the characters her character has helped along the way have shined on this album.",1468195200,5

I can see that there are some good intentions with this album, such as songs like ""Foaming At The Mouth"" ""Divided We Conquer"" and ""Be Enough"" being good enough songs, but I would love Nonpoint to really dig deep into their talent and make an album that's closer in quality to their first four or so albums. I'd recommend this to Nonpoint fans who enjoy this band's sound and like to see a band consistently release albums. But seeing that these guys are very unique, they didn't exactly complete the task of making this truthfully unique. This is simply an OK album.

These are both phenomenal songs on a very good album from this group, one of which I haven't xactly been very fond of in the past. This is an electronicore group that doesn't exactly settle on being predictable or embarassing. They are a group that write very genuinely on this album, and put various genres together such as pop, electronica, metalcore, and post-hardcore, and create very well written music. Easily recommendable.

While this album is not as experimental as ""La Gargola"" was, there are still moments where the band strays from their direction, with a song like ""Punchline"" which is the softest song on the disc, ""Shot From A Cannon"", which is the longest song on here and closes the album very well, and ""Enemies"", which has a punk feel to it. Overall, my favorite songs on here are ""Joyride (Omen)"" and ""Last Days"". One of the best albums of the year. For more alt metal that thinks outside the box, check out Deftones' new album ""Gore"".

82297,56,1337,"It is so sad whenever someone whom is suppose to be talented, has to be more of a product to deliver better in music. But sadly, the problem with Beyonce' Knowles is that she has been more of a product, trying to severely overexpose her music, and not give better in her own work overall, by putting patience and time to find better. When I had heard she was going to pull out a ""surprise record"" back in 2013, I was honestly not interested in stunts without listening to the voice at heart. Sadly, she really did not push herself better into her own work for her self-titled Beyonce' record in 2013, she just instead overdid herself and fell apart at the seems. most of the tracks have really been poorly prepared, and shown no growth in her soul. XO is honestly one of those songs that doesn't flow as a ballad. I really found it to be weaker than her past works like Flaws In All and Listen from Dreamgirls back in 2006. I really found this song to be a bust at soul overall. Perhaps it should be time for Beyonce' Knowles to think about retirement, and come back when she better up her chops than faltering at the soul as a stunt.

82305,2191,18105,"Sacred Visions is the sixteenth release from multi-instrumentalist Peter Sterling, who recorded this album at his own Thunder View studio in beautiful Sedona, Arizona. Having designed the albums artwork, Peter also creates sacred geometry stained-glass art, as well as presents sound healing and sacred geometry workshops. Sacred Visions is comprised of nine compositions spanning fifty-two minutes, where Peter showcases his beautiful harp-playing (his main instrument), along with keyboards, percussion and other instruments. Additionally, musicians Richard Hardy, Bruce Becvar, Hans Christian, Robin Miller, Fitzhugh Jenkins and the smooth jazz band 3rd Force lend their talents to varying compositions.

Sedona Sunset opens with tribal percussion and a flowing arrangement of various instruments, where Peters luscious harp is joined by electric guitar courtesy of Robin Miller and native flute provided by Richard Hardy. Lushly tropical with a blend of both indigenous and modern instruments, one is instantly carried away to an exotic destination of intrigue and exploration. The piece eventually concludes with the nocturnal chirps of insects, leading seamlessly into the next track, Shamans Cave. Dreamy harp textures and added tropical motifs exude sensual warmth, bringing to mind a mesmerizing landscape rich with lush forests, colorful birds and crystal-blue lagoons. Next up is Starlight and Moonbeams, which opens with wordless vocals and ethnic percussion. This seemingly nocturnal yet celebratory composition conveys an essence of sailing on a river, as it winds through a forest while the traveler gazes up at the night sky. An Indian female voice graces Bombay Boogie, which is accompanied by tribal-esque backing vocals, the continuous flow of harp and a gently rhythmic underscore. Eclipse bears a touch of smooth jazz, which comes as no surprise considering this romantic piece features the talents of Craig Dobin on piano and William Aura on bass, whom together make up the band 3rd Force. Also joining the admixture is Bruce Becvar on guitars, all collectively interwoven with Peters heavenly harp atop a subtly chill rhythm. Dance of Saraswati features the musical contributions of Hans Christian on cello and Fitzhugh Jenkins on guitar, a composition that is additionally brushed by a fine touch of male and female vocals. Hans Christian also lends his amazing talents to Mystic Rose in the form of a Sarangi, a string instrument that comes from India and Nepal. This seductively alluring composition additionally features tabla drums, Indian vocals, and Peters signature harp, which further lend an exotic mysticism to the composition. Shifting cultural gears is Thru the Valley and Over the Hills, a notably Celtic-flavored piece laced with Peters graceful harp and penny whistle courtesy of Richard Hardy. Magical and dreamy, it feels like wandering through an enchanted golden land. A Celtic mode revisits the closing piece, Remembrance, where Hans Christian once again lends his cello. This serene composition softly lulls the listener into winding down, while being wrapped in a blanket of peace and comfort.

Profoundly gorgeous from start to finish, the compositions that collectively make up Sacred Visions could be described as world fusion harp music, with the albums pan-cultural and poly-rhythmic sensibilities bearing some similarities to the music of both Cusco and the Adventure Cargo series. Peters mellifluous harp-playing is pristinely interwoven into these rich musical tapestries that seem to swirl and spin throughout like colorful mandalas. Sacred Visions is not only recommended for fans of stellar harp-playing, but to anyone who enjoys the best that new age world fusion has to offer.",1468281600,5

82310,2664,18258,"On her 4th album, New York artist Mitski dives headfirst into the mix without a helmet, both lyrically and musically.  The songs tell stories that are filled with nuances and implied meanings, but the emotional cost is obvious.  The sounds range from dangerous electronics to rock n roll guitars to string n harmony ballads, all within arrangements that push the parameters of melody & creativity.  There is a dark aura of unpredictability here, rising from Mitskis voice in a sort of brave and disturbed beauty.  Sometimes reminds of artists such as EMA, Scout Niblett, P.J. Harvey.  Puberty 2 is not a particularly easy album to listen torather, it revels in the kind of unease that makes you squirm with the recognition that you are a part of something that matters.

82313,6803,17577,"I've been a casual Architects fan since seeing the British riff titans play my first Warped Tour in 2009. The band, like their UK brothers in Bring Me The Horizon, have evolved with each release. Sometimes these shifts manifest in a complete 180 in direction (The Here & Now), others just taking the bits of their metalcore formula and tweaking it to near perfection (Hollow Crown, LF/LT). I could confidently say All Our Gods, like That's The Spirit, not only sounds like a band coming into their own and writing the songs they always wanted to. It sounds really freaking good.

The big selling point on ""New Architects"" is their mastery of the wall-of-sound. Each song is filled with thick, organic grooves that flirt with spurts of wanky technicality while keeping the background alive with ominous strings & ambient electronics. Songs like Gone With The Wind & All Love Is Lost use the wall to tremendous effect, letting the ambiance either quicken the pace or paint a picture of impending doom. The rhythm section is as tight as it's ever been, and the GUITARS...the riffs alone are worth the purchase...

...which would make the vocals the coconut icing on the groovy cake (i like coconuts and ran out of analogies, sue me). Sam's melodic scream is one of the best harsh vocals I've ever heard, and help make a lot of these songs...catchy! (Who knew I'd be humming ""I found God clutching a razorblade"" happily for days?)The choruses on this album are BIG, with highlights being Nihilist, Gone With The Wind, The Empty Hourglass & my personal favourite, All Love Is Lost. Even better, the lyrics are strong, passionate & quite well written.

The album deals mostly in real issues and the degradation of humanity's compassion as we become more and more jaded through violence, religion, government & our own apathy. These hard issues mix with the tight grooves, harsh vocals and massive atmospheres to make Architects' strongest release to date. A STRONG contender for not just the best -core album of 2016, but one of the best in all of metal.

Sidenote; I bought the vinyl edition, which while simple its packaging, sounds EPIC. It comes with a free download card, but seeing that the album is currently Autorip elligable I'll be giving my card to a friend. I encourage you to spread the word as well.

For fans of; mid-period BMTH, anything mildly djenty, good ol' Hardcore-centric Metalcore.",1468281600,5
82314,2664,18259,"Ill admit it; I sometimes have a tough time connecting to the female singer/songwriter genre.  Theres often something thats just toowell, girly for me to latch on to.  The debut full-length album from New Yorks Margaret Glaspy kills that issue with some open-wound lyrics and an evocative voice thats revved up by surprisingly raw bursts of her bluesy guitar noise.  For every moment of folky pop-lite, theres a balancing bit of garage roots grunge that rings high on the distortion/emotion register.  Members of her band have played in Dumpster Hunter, Invisible Familiars, Fiction Family.  Emotions and Math shows an unrestricted purity that mixes the Americana ghost of Lucinda Williams with Joni Mitchells fragility and a touch of Billie Holiday.  Glaspy has a voice and style that will definitely grow on you.  Recommended.",1468281600,5
82315,12631,9632,"If you listened to all of the hype back in the day this guy was supposed to be an emerging superstar. Bob Lind was a folk-rock singer-songwriter from Baltimore. After dropping out of college Bob moved to Denver and began working the local folk clubs. Shortly thereafter he made a demo tape. The folks at Liberty records were duly impressed and signed Lind to their World Pacific subsidiary. Among the tunes on that demo was ""Elusive Butterfly"" which became his first and only hit single peaking at #5 on the Billboard Hot 100 in early 1966. Much was expected of the follow-up record ""Truly Julie's Blues"" but it proved to be a major disappointment. The well must have run dry because for all intents and purposes Bob Lind was never heard from again. Still, ""Elusive Butterfly"" is a beautiful song that is well worth remembering.",1468281600,5

Even though it's not about the artist features, they did seem to be a bit lacking on this album. I think it's very cool that he did a song with Erica Campbell, though! I don't really have an anthem on this album like his other ones. Spinnin' is one you can really get down too, though, if you are in the mood to dance for the Lord! :)

82333,128,18262,"It took super fast emcee, singer, producer and all around artist Tonedeff (Pedro Rojas, Jr.) from Newport News, Virginia eleven years to release his sophomore LP, but the wait was worth it, for the most part.  He was actually building up to this moment with a string of EPs dropped annually over the last few years, but now we have the whole enchilada that is Polymer (July 8, QN5 Music).  Versatile when hes rapping or singing, Tonedeff on this project lives up to his name as a rapid-fire rhyme reciter on the mic, but it actually hurts him a little here.  His light speed vocals and blankety crooning tend to blur his verbally given lessons, and hes got plenty of good ones so lets recap.  At the start, he admits to feelings of alienation in a substance-lacking, so called hip-hop arena of late as he reviews his small yet respected place in the industry, but he risks sounding slightly jealous of some other mega-popular hip-hop artists.  He shouldnt.  Hes better than a lot of them.  Moments makes good use of time and encourages you to as well, Glutton criticizes taking things in excess and Five Sisters is the story of five sisters taking after their flawed mothers and releasing their attitudes into the world.  The production is busy, almost cluttered, with thick dense sound-mixing and chirpy electronic beat sounds occasionally.  Its sonically hard, intense, hectic and irked, giving an acidy rock type vibe for the most part.  A handful of Polymers tracks are not even rap songs.  Still, we get another alternative accomplishment from Tonedeff here with more good wise concept cuts.  Polymer only touches the excellent Archetype debut from the man instead of vying with it for which is better.  The former is by a sizable margin.  For all you super dedicated hip-hop heads out there though, check this one out for sure.",1468281600,4

82337,2635,17641,"This group is truthfully one you need to hear. They are an alt metal/hard rock band that writes very powerful music that success in being a bit unique even if they still use simple techniques. A song like ""Dead Man Walking"" from this EP is phenomenal, and shows that not only has the band matured from their previous album, but is a track on here that sets itself apart from other songs on here such as ""Friend Or Foe"" and ""Trenches"", which are still amazing tracks outright. This band is on the route to becoming a bigger name, so, I would easily have to recommend this effort highly to people who want to see them eventually reach that status.

82351,12631,7939,"Over the years I have written ad nauseam about how great it was to be a teen in the 1960's. Top 40 radio was at its peak in those days and I was glued to my radio for the Top 40 Countdown each and every week! For a few years during the mid-sixties a blued-eyed soul quartet from New York City ran up an impressive string of hit records. Felix Cavaliere, Dino Danelli, Eddie Brigati and Gene Cornish formed the Young Rascals back in 1964. Rock and roll afficianados might recall that all except Danelli had been members of Joey Dee's Starlighters who had several hit records in the early 1960's including the #1 smash ""Peppermint Twist"" in 1961. This talented new group was soon making lots of noise in the New York City area and several labels were interested in signing them. It was Atlantic that had the great good fortune to sign The Young Rascals in 1965 and just a few months later The Young Rascals released their very first single.

I have to say that I liked just about every single The Rascals ever released. They were great pop records.  In 1967 Atlantic released How Can I Be Sure.  This was the group's highest charted record with Eddie Brigati singing lead. The song peaked at #4 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was something of a departure from The Rascals standard fare.  This is probably the most beautiful tune the group ever recorded.",1468368000,5

Yet, when I do think of today's divas in R&B, Beyonce' and Rihanna, etc. they sincerely do not have voices that speak from the soul anymore. They will never be soulful and beautiful as was the great Whitney Houston. If there is one thing that I have adored about Whitney is that she always sang from the soul brilliantly. But not only do I think of Whitney alone, I also do think if her one and only baby, Bobbi Kristina Brown, whom tragically died in 2015 from abuse from drugs and severe depression dealing with Whitney's death three years earlier. But when I do think of Whitney and Bobbi together as mother and daughter, I do think of so many of Whitney Houston's songs, and with the anniversary of Bobbi Kristina's passing, I do think of the two of them in song, and the song where Bobbi Kristina go her short start is My Love Is Your Love. The song is definitely soulful and very upbeat from the heart today, as it was back then in 1998 when it came out. Wyclef Jean wrote a very lovely song for Whitney Houston and it still is one of those songs that I love listening to. This is a must have download for die hard Whitney fans, and new ones alike.

82358,12631,6818,"""Deep Purple"" was the biggest hit written by pianist Peter Derose.  The song was originally published in 1933 as a piano composition.  The tune became so popular in sheet music sales that in 1938 lyrics were added.  Several big bands of the day including Artie Shaw, Larry Clinton and Guy Lombardo to name but a few recorded the tune with varying degrees of success.  Then in 1963 Nino Tempo and April Stevens, a brother-and-sister duo from Niagara Falls, NY released their version.  It would prove to be the second most popular version of all-time and hit #1 on the pop charts in November 1963, just before President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas.  Deep Purple also won a Grammy Award for Best Rock and Roll Record of 1963.  This is the original hit recording you would remember from the radio.",1468368000,5

82360,56,617,"There is so much that I have honestly loved about Joe Cocker. Musically, he was one of the underrated but beautiful vocalists I have ever enjoyed listening to on radio. There will be never another soulful giant like he was. Musically as he was going into the 1980's, Joe really was still on the mend from years of drug and alcohol addiction, and his career was derailed for years. But he still had a lot to show from the inside with his voice. The song that really gave Joe Cocker a new generation of fans in the 80's, Up Where We Belong from ""An Officer & A Gentleman,"" remains one of the gifted movie songs that had ever been composed. The song which earned a Oscar back in 1983, is definitely worth listening to each and every time. Joe and Jennifer Warnes really had a lot of chemistry together in the song, and that still clicks today, as it did back in the early to mid 80's. If you honestly had never heard a Joe Cocker song before, well this is one of those tracks that I have absolutely recommended, and I still do. Right up there with Joe in heaven, up where he belongs.

82444,12631,463,"It has been a good long while since I have heard anything by Jose Feliciano.  I had forgotten just how accomplished a musician this man is.  Aside from being one of the world's great flamenco guitar players, Jose Feliciano can also play bass, banjo, keyboards, timbales, mandolin and the harmonica. Quite impressive! If you remember Jose from his heyday in the late 60's and early 70's then you are sure to recall his marvelous rendition of The Doors ""Light My Fire"" from the golden year 1968. Jose's intimate reworking of that tune climbed all the way to #3 on the Billboard Hot 100.  The song won Jose Feliciano a Grammy for Best Pop Male Vocal of 1968.  Meanwhile, Jose also won the Grammy for Best New Artist of 1968.  This is the original RCA Victor hit recording.",1468368000,5

Being old school, I hadn't come across anyone rap-intelligent nor mentionable since BB Jay, The Gospel Gangstaz, and Cross Movement - until I heard this 22nd Century, Poetic-Apostle.  Not having ever been easily impressed - I am beyond captured; as this phenomenal artist holds/keeps the attention of the listening, BELIEVER.  In addition to his fierce, lyrical dynamics, Sevin also carries quite a few notes past your raised eyebrows. Yepp, he sings!!  Like Commissary (previous album worth purchasing) this album gets a ""well-done"" reward for its personal-transparency and faithful quest...to deliver the GOSPEL GOODS!!  Like me, if you truly enjoy rap of Biblical Genre, you MOSDEF won't be disappointed.  (Too bad, they only allow 5 stars!!)",1468368000,5
82465,12631,2796,"According to the website All Music: ""First formed in the early '50s The Isley Brothers enjoyed one of the longest, most influential, and most diverse careers in the pantheon of popular music -- over the course of nearly a half century of performing, the group's distinguished history spanned not only two generations of Isley siblings but also massive cultural shifts which heralded their music's transformation from gritty R&B to Motown soul to blistering funk"".  Between 1962 and 2006 the group amassed a staggering total of 78 hits on the Billboard R&B charts while placing more than four dozen songs on the Billboard Hot 100 pop chart.  Quite an accomplishment!  In early 1966 The Isley Brothers made the move to Motown.  In February they released the single This Old Heart of Mine (Is Weak For You).  It would prove to be one of their biggest and most popular records of all-time.  It would be their only major hit during their two years at Motown.  This is the original hit recording.",1468368000,5

I understand hating Fall Out Boy, but for those who didn't cut their interest of music off at the end of the previous millennium or before, this song is an interesting and energetic take on the theme song.  It sounds like the same Fall Out Boy who made 2011's SAVE ROCK AND ROLL, not so much the FOB who did ""Sugar, We're Going Down"".  It's not an amazing accomplishment of musicality -- it might be mediocre -- depending on what your expectations of music is --- but it's certainly not awful, unless you hate Fall Out Boy or are too stuck in the ""good ol' days"" to know who Fall Out Boy is...",1468454400,4

I admit, these covers of mostly well known songs are not as good as some of the originals. I also admit that music can be reviewed subjectively by each person. The issue I really have with such negative reviews is that this list of songs was promoted as exclusive to Amazon Prime (eliminating the possibility of it being the original versions). I don't mind the type of re-recordings that are found here, and I am a little tired of the originals because I have heard them so many times.

One negative review did comment on the diversity of the artists and songs that were covered. I don't feel strongly about the point there is some diversity in the list), but I understand and would have liked some songs from more diverse genres. Otherwise, I want to thank Amazon for the effort that was made to provide something new and fun for Prime customers with no additional charge. . . they didn't have to do this).",1468454400,4

I now own all of her albums and she continues to put out great music. Now I can't wait to have the chance to see her live. Also. Watching the Transatlantic Sessions introduced me to several artist that I was not familiar and now own a lot of their work also.

Or perhaps you remember her as head nurse Dixie McCall in the hit TV series ""Emergency"". In addition to being a film and television actress, Julie London was also a singer of considerable note who released 32 albums of pop and jazz standards during the 1950's and 1960's, After signing with the fledgling Liberty records in 1955 she released her first single ""Cry Me A River"". Julie's sultry voice was the perfect vehicle for this haunting tune. The song would spend 20 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 peaking at #9 in late 1955.

82573,14479,17631,"3 years after ""Heartthrob"", Tegan Quin and Sara Quin have decided to stick with the same formula that helped them to break out of their usual indie acoustic sound.  Unfortunately, it ends up with some mixed results; most of the songs on this follow-up LP are a bit bland and flavorless.  However, 2 songs are a very good exception:  'That Girl' and 'Boyfriend.'  :)",1468454400,3

82587,56,1293,"It is so hard to believe that it has been 15 years since Alicia Keys came out of the music industry, and has shown that her work, her voice and her style have been both sophisticated, and her songs have been brilliant and shown a young woman who has written soulful and brilliant songs that have never gotten out of style. It is so sad that many of today's divas like Rihanna, Beyonce' and Katy Perry, just haven't even shown a brilliance in soul and songwriting that has really stood the test of time. It is so sad that many of today's divas so far never will have Alicia Keys style and strength in song. When she came out with Songs In A Minor back in 2001, it really was a game changer when a lot of soul music was deeply overlooked in regards to rap and hip hop throughout the 90's. The song that started it all for Alicia Keys, Fallin', still remains simply soulful and striking from each and every not Alicia put into the song. She definitely showed that she can not only sing, but Alicia can have style in song from beginning to end. I like this is song a whole lot. If you have never heard a Alicia Keys song before, well this is the first one I suggest you download for your music library.

The first side is wonderful all 4 songs are beautiful and fantastic.  That's How I Got T Memphis, Six White Horses and the master work of of the entire cd an over 10 minute song called Falling Rain that made me want to listen to it over and over again.  Let the World Go Back wraps up the good side.

The second side with 6 songs is virtually unlistenable - unless you really like country music (sorry folks - I know some of you will like it).

This time it's Les Claypool works with Sean on various tracks composed by both, each respecting the other's position, pulling off, if not a magnum opus, but a find collection of inticate stories that lead you from here to there and back again.  The Cricket montage is an art, while Mr. Wright pokes as much fun as a Monty Python sketch.  Statements of ironic perversion spill forth, but not accusing of anyone in particular, only that those who find themselves in that camp are to be ridiculed.  There is some reality (Bubble's Burst)  and yes, it's true, 'There is no underwear in space'.  For a comparison check out Donavan's 'Intergalactive Laxative' from Cosmic Wheel, if you can find it.

82751,4297,18305,"The prolific Philip Anselmo returns with another project, the newly minted Scour. Their self-titled debut EP offers five songs and one short, ambient piece. While Phil's fans have long known that he enjoys extreme metal, we've never gotten any quite like this from him. His debut solo album was a vicious mix of grind and groove with classic screaming Phil vocals, but Scour is straight-up black/death metal with Phil delivering the sickest roars and shrieks of his recording career. Most of the songs are intensely fast and raw, with a distinctly black metal style and sound. Unlike every other band I've heard from Phil, I don't hear a trace of Pantera in Scour's sound. I think this band could make an outstanding vehicle for Phil's extreme side, given that the music sounds nothing like Superjoint or his solo efforts. Although you can often hear that trademark Phil screech, his style here is much more in the extreme metal style, with guttural death metal growls and scraping, acidic, black metal shrieks. If you're into Phil Anselmo's more aggressive side, you should enjoy getting pummeled by Scour.",1468540800,5

82781,4505,18310,"This stands out as unique as a comedy album right from the start because it's obviously recorded in a small comedy club setting, rather than a giant concert hall setting like comedy albums usually are. I think this gives the album a more intimate real feeling. Her voice is also louder and more clear than you'd typically hear on a comedy album that was recorded in a giant concert hall.

She's got a very dry wit, which I enjoy from a comedian. Her delivery is very subtle, without that obnoxious 'laugh at your own jokes to encourage the audience to laugh too' nonsense that most stand up's do. I hate that, and Aparna Nancherla doesn't do it. So good for her! Her delivery is sort of like Ellen Degenerous, who also keeps a straight face through the punchline.

Her act starts a little slow. But it does get funnier as it goes. Stick with it through the opening few tracks. When it gets to Traveling Bard (Track 5) it picks up speed pretty quick. I nearly spit my coffee out when she described Dubai as ""What happens when a space station and a shopping mall lover each other very much"".

I thought this was a 3 star act at first. but I kept listening until it got rolling and it became a 5 star act starting with Track 5 that literally had me choking on my coffee multiple times.",1468540800,5

82868,12631,10505,"Although Motown released his incredible debut single ""Fingertips"" in 1963 it was really not until 1966 that Stevie Wonder would begin his amazing string of hits. Early in that year ""Upright (Everything's Alright)"" hit #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 while in the summer Stevie's moving version of Bob Dylan's ""Blowin' In The Wind"" would peak at #9. In November 1966 Motown released ""A Place In The Sun"". Written by Ronald Miller and Bryan Wells it was one of Wonder's first songs to contain social commentary. I really never stopped to think about it before but Stevie Wonder was only 16 years old when he recorded this tune. Amazing!

82938,56,17332,"It is so sad that whenever someone is talented, they really throw their voice away, and no longer show that they were once talented, and instead scared with strife and heartbreak. Sadly, Beyonce' Knowles has been one of those ""products"" that has stopped showing her own voice. Instead, she has been forced to severely overexpose herself, where other artists haven't even been able to deliver in sound and soul from the voice within. It is too sad that Beyonce' Knowles has been such a joke, that her voice tragically died over a decade ago, after she and Destiny's Child broke up. A few years ago, when she came out with a surprise record in 2013, it really has been more of a joke, and showed that she does not want to flex her vocals into higher territory. Her 2016, ""surprise, not surprise joke"" album Lemonade has been another disaster, focusing in on a scarred heart, with a upcoming split between her and Jay-Z whom had cheated on her. Most of the tracks were pathetic and Sorry, her latest single from the album is another weak song from her.. The song is chinsy, cheap, and is another faded joke in song. She really hasn't grown up enough. With more bad songs like this, I'd say to Beyonce' Knowles, retire from music and start her life over again. She has a lot of scars from her breakup with Jay-Z that need more healing than her career could show. Another failure.

Because of their previous works, I had very high expectations and they did not disappoint. The only song that might be lacking is 'Tick on a Dog' which sounds a bit too much like 'Up the Ladder' from their previous work, but hey, its not like its someone else's and its still a really good song. The title track is certainly worthy of title track selection.

83007,1339,16650,"The RETURN, not only Mike Howe but my return as I backslided with the previous four albums with RM singing (some call it singing). Upon trying to determine my favorite ""CHURCH"" album it was easy to eliminate four, Now that leaves 7, 3 Waynes and 4 Howes Something about Craig Wells guitar work was up on my list so that eliminates 1 Wayne and 3 Howes including this one which leaves ""Metal Church"", ""The Dark"" and ""Blessing in Disguise"" Help I can't choose I hated Blessing in 1990, because Howe wasn't Wayne but I got used to him and loved him later. Now back to this album. I have listened to this album now since March 25 and it mid July now because I don't want to form opinions to soon about a Band that I first heard in 1983 and as a young adult then I became a member of the Congregation after my baptismal. Thank you for bringing me back to the fold with Mike Howe as pastor, the late pastor David Wayne will always mean a lot to me, but a highly suitable replacement is back to lead his flock so this album comes back to my choices for Best Church album, even without the ""Deacon Wells"" So I am stuck on choosing from 4, This release is a breath of fresh air after being stagnated for awhile. Nice, crunchy, offering with the return of the Vocal giant Mike Howe...",1468627200,5

83044,1895,18350,"Trumpeter and fugelhornist Steffen Kuehn likes the jazz sound of big ensembles, a strong Latin percussion section, and bold brass. He received a Grammy for Best Tropical Latin Album in 2014 for his co-lead Pacific Mambo Orchestra. Yet he was born in Mannheim, Germany, came to the United States to earn his music degree at North Texas State University, and returned to Germany. The turning point was his resettlement in 1997 to Northern California and his gigs with Mark Levine, Ray Obiedo, Louie Romero, Brian Andres, and Wayne Wallace. Thus, this fourth album under his name has a core band of 11 accomplished members, including congas, timbales, and bongos, plus guest musicians on the ballad Serenity and on the Afro-Cuban styled Storm, such as saxophonist Bob Mintzer, keyboardist Christian Tumalan, and vocalist Alexa Weber Morales. The tunes are Kuehn's own creations, except for George Cable's Helen's Song and Russell Ferrante's Geraldine. The rich, warm, and comfortable sound of the ensemble, with guitar, acoustic and electric piano, bass, trombone, saxophones trumpet, and percussion, soothes the heart and moves the feet with groove and funk and peculiar time signatures. Few of Kuehn's own tunes will produce an ear worm, in contrast with the Cables and Ferrante's ballads, yet his arrangements are excellent, and his horn playing (as in his Lullaby) is special, with smooth, confidently strong tone. There is much music packed in the 10 tracks of total 49 minutes, and the quality of musicianship is top notch. It is interesting that the Bay Area brought non-Latinos Cal Tjader and now Steffen Kuehn into Latin Music to make some jazz history.",1468627200,5

83063,7667,4175,"i wanted to download this cd, but i could only take so many ho down country songs that all sound the same, and the folk songs, kinda boring. I loved xs and ohs, but as a singer she is boxing herself into a ho down gal. She is very talented, but alot of the songs sound the same. i love the jazz songs, some slow, some folk. The one song from ghostbusters is great, she needs to loose the ho down, too, too, many folk songs. I played some of it, and alot of people said, it all sounds the same. She needs to do the jazz, pop thing. If she keeps this same ho down country sound up. she will be done. Like I said she has a great voice, and can sound so different. but no more ho down country trash gal sound. its gonna get tired real soon. i  only liked 6 songs, the rest, folk white gal country trash songs. boring. Step it up Elle, you got a great voice, use it for better stuff. get ride of your white trash going to hell wearing short skirts, drinking, sexing style.....it will be the death of you. Be a real musical artist. shed what your selling. its gonna get old real quick. you can be so much more. this white trash ho down thing is tired. hope the next cd is better.",1468627200,3

83070,1814,2546,"Look at the other reviews for more scathing comments.  I don't think Richard Harris spent a lot of time analyzing this song, getting the verbal articulation down well, although he is capable of doing so.  It is difficult to get good versions of this song, with it's very strange lyrics.  I like Glen Campbell's version better, except it was live, and there is a long, long guitar solo in the middle that is just terrible.  It works in a live performance, but not as a studio recording.  Campbell was a fabulous guitar player; he was just showing off how fast he could play.  I still love this song, and will listen to Richard Harris's version.",1468627200,3

83086,18,18323,"Its rare that I review a soundtrack without having seen the underlying film. The Ghostbusters remake/reboot (featuring the all-female lead cast) came out in theaters yesterday (technically on Thursday, as it is the new Friday), and I am on the fence whether I will go see it. But also today is the release of the new movies soundtrack, and on that I can tell you that I am ALL IN.

Ghostbusters  Original Motion Picture Soundtrack (14 tracks; 46 min.) opens with the 2016 remake of the original theme song, brought by none other than Walk the Moon. The remake is updated just enough that it sounds fresh and contemporary, yet isn't so far removed that it becomes unrecognizable. In other words: a great job by WTM (plus singer Nicholas Petricca sounds uncannily like Ray Parker Jr.) . The same cant be said of the interpretation called Ghostbusters (Im Not Afraid), by Fall Aout Boy (feat. Missy Elliot). I find this version just off-putting. Much better is the beautiful and light-hearted and mostly a-cappella version by Pentatonix. And just to make sure that you remember which movie soundtrack you are listening to, the album closes with the original 1985 version from Ray Parker Jr. Yes! that makes in total 4 versions of the same song on here. As to the other songs, for me by far the best is Ghoster, a new track by up-and-coming indie UK band Wolf Alice. The song is short, but packs a wallop, courtesy of lead singer Ellie Rowsells powerful vocals. Short and sweet indeed. Another choice addition is Good Girls, a new track from Elle King, here in top ;girl empowerment form! (I saw her in concert last month, and she blew me awayin the best possible way.) Another truly noteworthy contribution is Get Ghost, also new and written specifically for the movie, by Mark Ronson, Passion Pit & A$AP Ferg, an irresistible dance-along tune. Since I haven't seen the movie, I have no idea how all these songs are used, whether they appear extensively or just in snippets, etc. But here it all sounds quite good, and this collection of mostly fun and upbeat songs is perfect for the summer. (Please note that separately from this, Amazon also has the original motion picture score, by veteran Hollywood composer Theodore Shapiro.)

Bottom line: whether the movie remake/reboot is any good is almost beside the point, certainly as it relates to this soundtrack. Sure, not all the songs are masterpieces and some even misfire (FOB), but there is enough new and original music on here that works great, and several of remakes (by WTM and Pentatonix) work very nicely. Bottom line: the jury may still be out on Ghostbusters the movie, but Ghostbusters the soundtrack is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1468627200,4

83150,9108,18364,"Brutal.
Great CD. Plenty of great riffs, blast beats but pure thrash brilliance. Blood Red Throne are great at this style. pure old school Thrash, Death Metal and blast beats. But this CD is beyond expectation. Very good playing throughout. Killer rhythm saw style guitar riffs. Clear production. A Death metal soon-to-be classic! IF you can tolerate the Vocal.

The Vocal is very guttural throughout. Brutal, with countering screams/fits. But man, this is great Death Metal. I love this band and their throwback to 90's Florida metal ,mixed with their brutal touch . Got all their stuff, but it has gotten so much better. This CD is very well produced. You know what your getting if you like these guys, but this CD actually is unique and catchy, slightly experimental in other spots, but a home run for this band. A great escape for Death Metal heads.

BUY IT. But remember, you gotta like the Vocal style. Guttural to scream. But works.",1468713600,5

Truth be told, the market is just not there for blue done this well. That alone speaks to the state of airplay music in the country right now. This is just a superb album. My favorite track is which ever one is playing.

There are a lot of ""love"" songs in it, more so than any of the others, which can sometimes get a little awkward to sing along to, but they're still good songs.  The others are fun, there are a couple that are really hard hitting, and then there's some really encouraging ones.  Typically on an album I find that I skip through about 3 or 4 songs and on this only a couple are kind of ""meh"" for me.

83334,1348,18219,"If there's one band that has defined consistency within the rock genre over the last 15 years (give or take), it would be Chevelle. What started off as a few skateboarders riffing on Helmet and Tool quickly turned into a hit-single churning force that has now evolved into a hard rocking power trio that are an island unto themselves. Think of all those bands Chevelle shared radio (and stage) space with back in the 2000s. Think of how awful a lot of those bands have become. Here we have Chevelle, on their eighth studio album, still on a major label and yet not shedding one single ounce of integrity.

In fact, ""The North Corridor"" may be their heaviest and densest album to date. Re-teaming with Joe Barresi, who also produced the band's previous two albums, Chevelle have crafted a tightly-wound ten song set that plays to their strengths as an even tighter live act. The album busts open with ""Door To Door Cannibals,"" the sort of song Page Hamilton should really be pounding out at this point in his career. Thick guitar riffs careen over the ever-reliable rhythm section while frontman Pete Loeffler stabs and howls his way through what is essentially an anti-single. Likewise, the other nine tracks aren't the sort of thing you're bound to hear alongside the current crop of over-produced rock bands. On ""Young Wicked,"" the main Loeffler seems to be echoing golden-era Maynard James Keenan as he snarls and fights against the gravity of the music. While there's nothing here that screams ""hit single,"" ""Joyride (The Omen)"" comes close in its fierce catchiness. Like most of the album it's punchy and to the point, fierce and intensely focused.

As always, Barresi's production does the band sweet, sweet justice. Dean Bernardini's thunderous basslines drive many of the songs, while drummer Sam Loeffler is, as always, the key ingredient to the band. Few modern rock drummers can match his air-tight and infectious delivery, and it locks in perfectly with Pete's hooky guitar riffs. While it's true that Chevelle still sound very much like Chevelle, it's amazing how they can keep hammering away at their own brand and still churn out gold like this. Few bands of this ilk have mastered the art of maintaining their identity without repeating themselves, but ""The North Corridor"" not only continues to push the band along on its journey, but pays tribute to the young music-loving kids that started the whole thing to begin with as well. ""The North Corridor"" is a sound so big and overwhelming that, frankly, it's like throwing a hot dog down a hallway.",1468800000,4

Mark and Travis are good songwriters on their own (I really enjoyed their +44 album). But you know who I do hear a lot of here? John Feldman. And that's a problem.
How has John Feldman become an in demand producer/ songwriter? His band Goldfinger were notorious trend hoppers without the good taste of writing memorable songs. As a producer he scrubs all the dirt from any song and then fills every empty space with generic, bland ""whoa-oh' vocals, assuming that's melody or memorable songwriting.
There are a few decent songs here and there but not enough to recommend this album.",1468800000,2

83372,12631,4828,"As the story goes Martha Reeves went to work at Motown as a secretary sometime around 1962 for the paltry sum of $35.00 per week. As Martha recalls ""As part of my job I had to audition other artists, schedule musicians, maintain studio logs and be 'girl-friday' to all the writers and producers. If I clapped or sang background on sessions that was an additional $5.00 each."" Like so many other artists who came to work at Motown in the early days, Martha Reeves just wanted to get her foot in the door. You see in her spare time she was the lead singer of a local Detroit group known as the Del-Fi's. Her ultimate goal was to get an audition and get a recording contract for her group. Soon the Del-Fi's were hired to sing background on several of Marvin Gaye's early records. Berry Gordy quickly realized that these girls were something special. The group changed its name to Martha and the Vandellas and within just a few months the group was riding high on the Billboard Hot 100 with their debut single ""Come And Get These Memories"". It was the beginning of a fabulous run for this extremely talented and highly energetic group.

Motown wasted little time in issuing the follow-up single. Released in early August 1963 ""(Love Is Like A) Heat Wave"" would become one of the biggest records of that summer peaking at #4. To me the pulsating sounds of Martha Reeves and the Vandellas were the personification of Motown's moniker ""The Sound of Young America"" and this is one of the finest examples.

83383,12631,3088,"As the story goes Martha Reeves went to work at Motown as a secretary sometime around 1962 for the paltry sum of $35.00 per week. As Martha recalls ""As part of my job I had to audition other artists, schedule musicians, maintain studio logs and be 'girl-friday' to all the writers and producers. If I clapped or sang background on sessions that was an additional $5.00 each."" Like so many other artists who came to work at Motown in the early days, Martha Reeves just wanted to get her foot in the door. You see in her spare time she was the lead singer of a local Detroit group known as the Del-Fi's. Her ultimate goal was to get an audition and get a recording contract for her group. Soon the Del-Fi's were hired to sing background on several of Marvin Gaye's early records. Berry Gordy quickly realized that these girls were something special. The group changed its name to Martha and the Vandellas and within just a few months the group was riding high on the Billboard Hot 100 with their debut single ""Come And Get These Memories"". It was the beginning of a fabulous run for this extremely talented and highly energetic group.

This album has the beats, flow, production that I was missing, but it's a Christian album! Praise Jesus that these guys can make great music that sounds super fresh and sharp.  I highly recommend it, great EP!  If you used to listen trap rap, but don't want the drugs, sex, or alcohol message, and want a good message that has SICK beats. Then I highly recommend Wordsplayed's album.

Thanks guys for great music, and I hope you continue to glorify Christ.

That said, it didn't take but a song or two to say this album really is a fine album. The storytelling is first rate as always and Shawn Colvin smooths over any rough vocal spots with grace and matches well with Steve Earle's natural twang.

83480,15463,18393,"New York Polyphony, whose 2014 Christmas album was a stand-out release, now present this superb recording of great music from the Eternal City's 16th Century artistic peak. Singing one voice per part (the core group in the 4-part works, augmented with other fine singers in 6-part repertoire) New York Polyphony provides absolute purity in these amazing works. There's been some criticism that there's too much precision - Brian Wilson at MusicWeb International says, in an otherwise admiring review, ""everything here sounds just a little too perfectly polished"" - but I don't see it that way. The intelligibility of the words of the mass in spite of polyphonic overlapping became an important issue following the Council of Trent, and under the influence of Cardinal Charles Borromeo, according to Ivan Moody's excellent essay included in the liner notes. This repertoire, and especially the Palestrina, is about the spiritual life, but the politics of the Counter-Reformation (even if one discounts the debunked legend of Palestrina as 'saviour of polyphony') looks to the presentation of Catholic music as perfect and eternal. Power, purity, polish, polyphony: these all go with another P word: power.

Finally, I must say some words about the great record company BIS. From their home in Sweden they have real global reach: their projects with OSESP in Sao Paulo and Bach Collegium Japan in Tokyo represent the highest possible musical and engineering standards. This project with New York musicians recording in Omaha, Nebraska continues that legacy of excellence.",1468800000,5

It was an impressive beginning for the group known as The Lovin' Spoonful. The group termed their approach ""good-time music"". Yet their biggest hit was a bit of a departure from that idea. ""Summer In The City"" spent a total of three weeks atop the Bill Hot 100 in August of 1966. This gritty tune features a series of car horns during the instrumental bridge, starting with a Volkswagen Beetle horn, and ends up with a jackhammer sound, in order to give the impression of the sounds of the summer in the city. Very different and extremely impressive. The song would sell more than a million copies and has been recognized by Rolling Stone as one of ""The 500 Greatest Songs of All-Time"".

83497,56,13965,"It is honestly and absolutely so sad whenever someone young talented and gifted passes away early, without really showing just how dear and strong their talents were and precious their soul was, before they have died. Unfortunately, Amy Winehouse is a example of a songstress that could've been bigger, but died way too young. Because she couldn't get her own life together, and fell apart from drug and alcohol abuse because of so much loss in her life. She will always be known as a one album wonder in the U.S. with Back To Black. But she might have been broken, but could've had a voice that was bigger at life and heart. Her last single recorded before Amy lost her life, was a soulful and intimate duet with the great Tony Bennett with Body & Soul. The song which was released as a part of Tony's Duets II album, and on Amy's posthumous Lioness: Hidden Treasures. It is a somber farewell to someone that could've been bigger in life, if she stayed on the straight and narrow. Amy had a soulful voice that still was worth while, despite her death at 27 years old. She & Tony had beautiful chemistry together, and more could've been added in song, if Amy was still alive today. Five years after Amy Winehouse passed, I am constantly reminded of why more could've been done with her, and yet she went too soon. This is a great download for die hard Amy Winehouse fans, and anyone whom had never heard one of her songs before.

83558,56,12967,"It is so sad that someone like Mariah Carey has been very poor and weak in regards to her songs that she has covered. Honestly, throughout Mariah Carey's career, she really has been very poor at really finding the right songs that have matched her soul in covers, and sonnets from her heart. Musically, she does not have the ear and voice for covers within the soul that songstresses like the great Whitney Houston and Celine Dion have had with covers and delivered from the soul overall. Hard to believe that there were only two cover songs that Mariah Carey had delivered on very well. Her rendition of the Jackson 5's I'll Be There, and Endless Love with Luther Vandross in 1994. But otherwise, it has been more of a waste from Mariah Carey overall. Her rendition of Foreigner's I Want To Know What Love Is, has a few problems overall. One is that she does not sing a key verse that Lou Gramm did so well, ""This Mountain I Must Climb Feels Like The World Upon My Shoulder..."", a huge bust from Mariah. Second of all, Mariah Carey sounds cheaper with her 80's covers over the years: Against All Odds by Phil Collins, Journey's Opens Arms and Def Leppard's Bringing On The Heartbreak from 2003's Charmbracelet. This is one song I would not recommend for any die hard Mariah Carey fan, and for new ones alike. She does not want to know what love is, after her wasted past few marriages, and with the musical ear.

Over the years the group would amass an impressive total of seven Top Ten Hits. It all began in 1961 with the #9 hit ""Every Beat Of My Heart"" on Chicago's Vee-Jay label. Later that same year ""Letter Full of Tears"" would make some noise nationally on the tiny Fury label. Several lean years would follow. Then in 1966 Gladys Knight & The Pips would sign with Motown. After a couple of nondescript releases they recorded the original version of the Norman Whitfield-Barrett Strong tune ""I Heard It Through The Grapevine"". The song went all the way to #2 on the Billboard Hot 100. Just a year later Marvin Gaye would release his version of the song which spent a total of 7 weeks at the top of the charts.

83571,634,18341,"Prime Cuts: Happiness, Money and Fame, Testify

After 2014's ""Rivers in the Wasteland,"" which was a more reflective and rootsy recess, NEEDTOREATHE are back in the saddle with open cylinders.  Sounding rejuvenated and upbeat, ""Hard Love"" (stylized as ""H A R D L O V E"") finds the quartet back with their familiar grunge rock sounds with undercurrents of soul and EDM.  The band is composed of Bear Rinehart (lead vocals, guitar, piano), Bo Rinehart (backing vocals, guitar), Seth Bolt (backing vocals, bass) and Josh Lovelace (backing vocals, keys). Prior to this release, they have released five studio albums: Daylight (2006), The Heat (2007), The Outsiders (2009), The Reckoning (2011) and Rivers in the Wasteland (2014).

Co-produced by NEEDTOBREATHE and recorded at their very own Plantation Studios in Charleston, SC, ""H A R D L O V E"" is the quartet's sixth studio album.  In sync with the bulk of their own canon, these 12 songs pendulum swings between downright secular love and moralistic songs to thinly cloaked spiritual songs.  Opening with the 0.56 minute prelude ""Mountain Part One,"" we get a foretaste of the album with the song's electronic warbling and the distorted sounds.  With its distance-sounding vocals that calls to mind those analog records of the 70s and with swirling fat electronic beats, the title cut ""H A R D L O V E"" is where nu folk meets EDM.

Featuring some Motown brass horns accompanying a tune that could have well been written by Marvin Gaye in his prime is ""Money and Fame.""  This soul-pricking tune warns against the temptations that the two commodities bring told with some arresting lines: ""I was sleeping with a loaded gun/I was scared of all the things I've done.""  ""No Excuses"" finds Bear utilizing his Prince-esque falsetto over an electric guitar-led rock tune.  Though the song doesn't mention Jesus directly, the punchy and upbeat ""Happiness"" gets to the heart of our Lord's teaching: what constitutes contentment?

""When I Sing"" and ""Great Night"" step away from the spiritual hefty terrain for more down time fun.  Yet, for a band who has got on ruminating about life's meaning via ""Happiness,"" to hear them singing:""Let's have a great night on the dance floor/I'll be the cowboy on the white horse"" sounds incongruous.  Much more substantial is the romantic folkish ballad ""Let's Stay Home Tonight.""  ""Testify,"" which is a modern worship anthem about surrendering to God, gets back into the CCM territory.

The same can be said about ""Clear"" which is essentially a love song to God.  Though it is understandable that NEEDTOBREATHE is trying to reach beyond the CCM crowd, but when it's a blatant worship song, is it too much to ask if the name ""Jesus"" is mentioned perhaps once or twice?",1468886400,4

83611,634,17846,"Prime Cuts:  Float, I Won't Let You Go, The Day that I Found God

Switchfoot returned to its surf culture roots with ""Fading West,"" where ocean-inspired reverbs and sandy percussion were its sunny-sounding canopy.  Such a recess from their post-punk rock sound has done the group well.  Sounding rejuvenated and packed with more grace-gilled melodies, ""Where the Light Shines in"" is easily one of Switchfoot's best albums to date.  Rather than falling back on their heavy rock default sound, the sounds here are more purposeful and more varied.  Parts of the album still retain the Switchfoot grunge vibe, but this is also balanced by some more restrained and mellow ballads as well.

Switchfoot's journey began in 1997 with the first of three indie releases before signing with a major label in 2003. Since then, the San Diego, CA based outfit have sold 5.7 million copies worldwide of their nine studio albums (including 2003's The Beautiful Letdown and 2009's GRAMMY Award-winning, Hello Hurricane). Where The Light Shines Through marks the band's return to the indie world and showcases that, two decades from their start, they're able to have a career filled with longevity, revitalization and rejuvenation.

""Where the Light Shines Through"" is the band's 10th album and the years of recording, writing and touring have given Switchfoot a wizened depth to their songs.  The title cut ""Where the Light Shines Through"" is easily one of the best treatise on suffering that is both Biblically responsible as well as creative. As suffering has a way of making feel alien to the world, the use of the space imagery to underscore the theme of how God can use our pain for his glory is just sublime.  In a musical culture where imagery is sneered, take a listen to ""Holy Waters."" Here you will be engulfed by the vividness of the song that you can't help but ""see"" the song unfold like a breathtaking movie before your eyes.

Partnering with Lecrae over some hip hop beats is ""Looking for America.""  The rhetorical use of questions in the midst of the song reaps some serious soul-searching rewards. Then Switchfoot gets to the dance floor with ""Float,"" which also boasts some Prince-like guitar riffs that the late Purple Highness would be proud of.  Recalling back some of the older Switchfoot sound is the swaggering ""If the House Burns Down Tonight.""  They get into some heart-wrenching moments with the story song ""The Day I Found God,"" which contains the moving line: ""The day I lost myself was the day that I found God.""

""I Won't Let You Go"" is the reason why this reviewer is a Switchfoot fan.  Never ones to shy from the complexities of life, yet still able to find the peace in life's chaos, ""I Won't Let You Go"" is faith in its most palatable form.  Forget all the manufactured and manicured songs out there.  If you want songs that engage the messiness of life and yet do not betray the truth of Scripture, check this album out immediately.",1468886400,5
83612,1424,17846,"Ive been a Switchfoot fan ever since New Way to Be Human was released back in 1999. I can still remember the days of wearing a Switchfoot t-shirt to school and having hardly anyone recognize them. My wife even had a friend who made a bet that the band would never make it big because they were terrible. Shes still waiting on that $20 payment. Needless to say, Ive believed in this band for a long time and after 17 years I continue to do so, though my excitement has worn off a bit over the past few years. Where the Light Shines Through has a lot going for it, yet it also suffers some of the same problems that have plagued the groups previous records, leaving it in a difficult spot and leaving me with conflicted feelings.

The album starts off on a very positive note. Holy Water is a solid rocker, the kind of engaging anthem that the band has become known for and it grabs your attention immediately. Unfortunately Float really kills the momentum and takes the album into a left turn that feels unnatural. The song has grown on me over time but within the context of the album it feels forced; it should have been moved in the running order or saved for another project. Thankfully the albums title track and I Wont Let You Go keep things moving, with the latter being one of the albums best cuts. I have to give particular attention to If the House Burns Down Tonight, both lyrically and musically. It manages to be both catchy and intriguing, driving at a restless pace while looking at the differences between possessions and relationships. The Day That I Found God is equally beautiful. The first half of this album fares quite well and offers us a number of wonderful moments.

The second half feels patchier. Bull in a China Shop and Healer of Souls both fail to leave much of an impression even after numerous listens. Shake This Feeling and Live It Well feel a bit generic but work well enough for what they are. Looking for America is the weakest cut on this LP, a fact that the normally talented Lecrae cant save. It feels like what it is: a couple of artists complaining about America without offering any real solutions beyond surface level catchphrases. Sure, America is in trouble, but couldn't the band at least turn that into something more inspiring than the typical feel guilty because of the nations past rhetoric thats been far too prevalent over the past few years? I used to think Switchfoot was above that sort of thing but here they sound woefully out of their depth. Thankfully Hope Is the Anthem ends the album with a bang and continues the bands tradition of exhilarating closers.

Where the Light Shines Through is a bit inconsistent but musically it feels lively and diverse, with enough variety that even the pickiest of listeners should walk away satisfied. What holds the album back (at least for me) is the lyrics, which have been a problem for several records now. Jon Foreman knows how to write deep and convicting lyrics, as evidenced by tunes like The Economy of Mercy, The Shadow Proves the Sunshine and Company Car. That was one of the elements that drew me to the band initially and there are times when I still catch glimpses of it. The problem is that Jon rests on the same topics of love, hope, belonging, materialism, inner turmoil and rising up. Normally those topics are fine and even inspiring but by now I just feel that Jon has exhausted those subjects and used every variation imaginable to say essentially the same thing. Too often it feels like a line of generic catchphrases and muddy solutions, neither of which moves me on a deeper level. Love and hope are wonderful things but there are ways to branch out and present them from a fresh perspective. I just want the lyrics to be as interesting and diverse as the music. Tracks like If the House Burns Down Tonight prove they can still do it and it would be great to see more like it.

I apologize for a longer than normal review but I think Switchfoot is one of the best and most talented bands weve had in the past 20 years. Its out of love and care that I point out when the band isn't working because I want them to be the best they can be. Where the Light Shines Through is excellent in many respects---but the clich lyrics and uneven pacing hold it back from being truly great. My wife and I will be seeing them in September and it will no doubt be a marvelous experience. Id just like to see them push their lyrics and solutions as far as the music allows.",1468886400,4

The original was about how people in fear have the Ghostbusters to call.  How when in danger they have heroes to turn to.  The original inspired and entertained.  The music energized fans everywhere, and the Ray Parker Jr.'s voice was powerful.

This music sucked, and the verses were distort versions of the original.  It wasn't even a single singer doing it.  They had one singer doing the main bit, and then a separate rap singer for some.  And it didn't even seem like singing at many points - just fanatically chanting ""I'm not Afraid""",1468972800,1

83655,4883,18163,"This album is quite a disappointment. I should start by saying, ""I hate Tom Delonge."" He's super annoying with his stupid voice. I should follow up with ""I love Matt Skiba"". So when I found out that he was replacing the one part of Blink-182 that I didn't like, I was ecstatic. And when I heard ""Bored to Death"", I was so pumped... And then the album came out, and I was very... ""eye rolly"". Mainly because of the lyrics and the production. Most of these song would be great, if they'd been produced by someone else, and if the lyrics weren't so ""teenage girl"".

Matt Skiba is an amazing lyricist, and his output with Blink, is well, terrible... and Mark is not doing much better here. Some songs are totally Blink, (i.e. Cynical, Bored to Death, Sober, Left Alone.) Some are kind of experimental (Los Angeles, California). And then some songs are good, but ruined by corny lyrics and Boy Band production, (i.e. The Only Thing That Matters, She's out of her Mind, Rabbit Hole.)
Here's an example: ""I'm in deep with this girl but she's out of her mind, She said ""babe, I'm sorry but I'm crazy tonight"".
I can't roll my eyes ANY harder... Come on, Skiba.

83676,12631,11954,"For an all too brief period in the mid 1960's Petula Clark was a major force on both the Billboard Hot 100 and on Top 40 radio as well. Born in Epsom England in 1932, Petula Clark made her entrance into show business at a very young age. In fact she hosted her very own radio show ""Pet's Parlour"" at the age of 11 and made her debut on the British charts way back in 1954. At the tender age of 22 Petula Clark would become a major recording star in Britain. She maintained a constant presence on the British charts for the next decade and was a major star throughout Europe as well. Then lightning struck in early 1965 when ""Downtown"" went all the way to #1 on the U.S. pop charts. Just a few months later Warner Brothers released the follow-up single ""I Know A Place"". The song was nearly as big a hit as ""Downtown"" in the U.S. peaking at #3 and would earn Petula Clark a Grammy for ""Best Rock & Roll Female Vocal"" of 1965.  A memorable vocal performance!",1468972800,5

Seems very strange to me because here in America Chad and Jeremy made quite a splash in 1964 and 1965. As another reviewer has duly noted Chad and Jeremy produced several hit records with ""harmonies to die for"". Of course the biggest hit was the one everyone is familiar with. ""A Summer Song"" peaked at #7 in September 1964. The boys released a dozen or so more singles over the next few years but could never repeat the success of ""A Summer Song"".

In fact, the legendary R&B group The Drifters had been formed in 1953 to showcase the vocal prowess of lead singer Clyde McPhatter. In late 1954 McPhatter was inducted into the Army and assigned to Special Services in the continental United States, which allowed him to continue recording with The Drifters. However, when he was discharged in 1956 he left the group to pursue a solo career. Over the next few years he would record a number of outstanding sides for Atlantic records. His biggest hit during this period was released in late 1958. ""A Lover's Question"" was a tune written by Brook Benton and Jimmy T. Williams. The song peaked at #6 on the Billboard Hot 100 pop charts and spent a week atop the R&B chart. The song continues to be very popular among oldies buffs.",1468972800,5

""It keeps holding on and it's holding strong."" - ""Holding On"" by Guy & Howard Lawrence, Gregory Porter, & Jimmy Napes

Five APPEALING Stars. The song ""Holding On"" makes appearances in two different worlds. It was originally released by the British DJ/Instrumental electronic duo 'Disclosure' on their album ""Caracal"" with a driving house beat and Gregory Porter's sampled voice singing the lyric and it became a hit in the dance electronic world. It was actually written by the Disclosure brothers Guy & Howard Lawrence, Porter, and James Napier.

Here from his album, ""Take Me To The Alley"", over a churning beat from drummer Emmanuel Harrold, Grammy-winner Gregory Porter applies the full weight of his charismatic baritone voice that grows more determined in selling the lyrics, then Keon Harrold plays an excellent heartfelt muted trumpet solo, before a yearning Porter returns to seal the deal. Two different worlds of music, jazz and electronic dance, collaborating on one song, with the similar successful results within their genres. Plus there is yet another version of this song on this album with R&B/soul singer Kem echoing, singing alone and in unison with Porter on the bridge. Chip Crawford is on piano and Aaron James is on bass. This is another well-deserved success for Porter. Highly Recommended. Five SOULFUL Stars. (Blue Note records. 1-MP3 track.

83764,56,13012,"There are just very few songs today that really have tapped from the soul of the heart that really have meant something overall. For someone like Andra Day whom has struggled so much in regards to having the success the way many divas have shown like Adele and Jennifer Hudson, it has been a bit more of a struggle. So far, she has shown to be more of a one-hit wonder to start, and her debut song is one of those songs that really has worked overall. Her breakout hit song Rise Up is one of those songs that speaks soulfully softly alone from Andra, and just lets the voice from within carries nicely. This song has been one of those songs that really has simply drove into me slowly and soulfully. I love the intimacy that she makes into the song, as a real anthem for anyone that is down for the count, told not to come back and stay down on the ground forever, as someone who is worth nothing, your nothing to us, a nobody. This song is worth listening to, and I hope there are more good songs from Andra worth hearing. Hopefully, she won't be one of those souls typecasted as a one-hit wonder.

83825,12631,6485,"Death discs were an important part of pop music in the 1950s and early 1960s. One of the most memorable was ""Tell Laura I Love Her"" in which a teenage driver had a fatal accident in the stock car race he had entered to win cash to buy a wedding ring. The tale was all the more effective for being sung in an angelic high tenor by Ray Peterson.

Ray Peterson was born in Denton, TX on April 23, 1935. As a young boy he contracted polio which required lengthy hospitalization. But while in the hospital he began to sing for the other patients and decided that is what he wanted to do with his life. In 1957 Ray Peterson moved to Los Angeles and signed a recording deal with RCA Victor. He had several modest hits and then in June of 1960 RCA released ""Tell Laura I Love Her"" written by Jeff Barry and Ben Raleigh. It would become a Top Ten hit.  This is the original hit recording you would remember from the radio.",1469059200,4

83848,4297,18432,"I'm always excited to see that Revocation is putting out a new album because they never disappoint. Great Is Our Sin continues their run of fantastic releases, this being their second effort since signing to Metal Blade Records. Just like on that one, they are continuing to grow their sound, but just a little bit at a time so as not to make any jarring stylistic changes. The main new element here is an increase on, for lack of a better term, clean vocals. The thing is, most of those vocals only sound clean compared to the raspy death metal approach to the rest. It's more of a classic thrash singing style than what you might expect. Tons of bands have those polar opposite vocals of half super-aggressive, half poppy radio cheese. Revocation does nothing of the sort. While there is plenty of melody to be found, this band is about 99% full-on metal, and that other 1% is more proggy than anything. I don't see any point going on about favorite tracks with an album like this. Pick a song, any song. It's awesome. Top-notch technical skills, quirky and unconventional, crisp production, brutal and just plain heavy. Any fan of thrash or technical death metal should love this band. Hard to believe they already have six albums and aren't better known than they are.",1469145600,5

I don't have to skip a single track on this album either which is very rare for me these days. I love how she has the little skits in between some songs also, it's like she's telling a story a with her music (and some made me laugh lol). I also love all 4 of the collabs she has on this album (it's cool that over half the songs aren't feat someone like most hip-hop artist these days, it proves she can actually make a hit w/o a feature). If you have been sleeping on Dreezy or just aren't sure if you should give this album a listen or not then DO IT! You will not be disappointed I promise! Dreezy is the real deal & she's from Chicago so she knows how to spit some bars. 5/5 stars for Dreezy & her debut album 'No Hard Feelings'!

83894,3489,18439,"I've been a big fan of Clairy's since I saw her and the group in the famous Heineken TV commercial a few years back. I've seen her and the group ""live"" twice here in San Francisco, and wasn't disappointed either time. I liked the second release, but it wasn't as good as the first CD, so I wondered what would be next. I was surprised when Clairy set out on her own as I liked her band and singers. So I was a bit nervous when I popped ""Pool"" into my player a few days ago. Yes, her style has changed, though she's not gone all pop on us. She still beats Lady Gaga by a mile by concentrating on the music rather than presenting a huge show on stage with the hope that the show will carry the music. Not that Clairy is boring when on stage, as she certainly isn't. She's fun, sexy, and beautiful! If the music is great, the reason for extravagant props, dancers, etc. is to allow the artist to charge such ridiculous prices for tickets to their shows. I'd rather have a simple show of great music. Clairy is also very sweet to chat with as well.

This new CD gets the listener moving without selling out to the pre-programmed mainstream pop music so popular for too long now. Clairy's anything but predictable. All but a couple of the songs have a great dance beat, but she's now abandoned that old-time jazzy sound. The vocals are great and the horns are still there as well. If this CD gets enough distribution, it could really kick start Clairy's career. This CD isn't on the jukeboxes yet, but I'm sure it will be soon. I really like the whole CD and will play it for others whenever I get a chance.

Good going, Clairy! Come back to San Francisco, and I'll gladly buy you another shot of whiskey!

As for the rest of you who are reading this, just buy the CD and enjoy it!",1469145600,5

And when we gather around the table, we all grasp each other's hands and we are thankful for America. We are thankful for, Mom, Baseball, Football, NASCAR,and Apple pie. And we are thankful that ""That Bird Will Never Change.

For those of the band that perished in a plane crash: RIP...",1469145600,5

For those who yearn for an escape from the chaos of Now, simply sit back and listen to Ryans music and everything evens out. He is an extraordinarily fine musician and composer and hopefully will continue to offer music of this caliber on a regular basis.

The tracks are as follows:

Close You Eyes
Seaside Dreaming

Without You
Take Me Away

83918,4505,18442,"If you need the relive the musical magic (and I do mean magic) that was the 1980's, this will get it done for you.

As you can see from the playlist, it's not too much obscure stuff. It's mostly stuff you know by heart. (But there is nothing BY Heart on this list). There were a couple tracks I wasn't intimately familiar with. But for the most part...it's classic stuff. The inclusion of Cyndi Lauper's The Goonies R Good Enough makes me so happy I can't even describe it. It's nice to see that someone in the modern era remembers that she did more than Girl's Just Wanna Have Fun and True Colors. It's also awesome that someone was looking at the Goonies Soundtrack.

The list could use a little Weird Al to really make it a true 80's experience. But then...what in life couldn't use a little Weird Al?

I don't love that they used a few modern remastered versions of some of the classics. It's not like they are re-recordings. They are just remastered from the original studio sessions. So it's not a hellworthy trespass or anything.

99 Red Balloons is the English version, if you were wondering. You will not have to have your German-English dictionary handy.

83926,12631,3594,"While I am not a particularly big fan of the music of the 1970's one group that stood head and shoulders above the rest was The Doobie Brothers. Led by vocalist Tom Johnston, this group successfully combined elements of rock 'n roll and R&B and made some of the most memorable music of the decade. And despite a rash of personnel changes along the way the group continued to make great music throughout the 1970's.

It did not take long for the group to make its mark on the American music scene. Formed in San Jose, Ca. in 1970, the Doobies found themselves riding high on the Billboard Top Pop Singles Chart when in the fall of 1972 their debut release ""Listen To The Music"" leaped all the way to #11. Quite an accomplishment! Then in April 1973 Warner Brothers released ""Long Train Runnin'"" which would become the group's first Top Ten record.  I have always felt that this was one of their best singles.  This is the original hit recording.",1469145600,5

It was surely the right choice because Manhattan Transfer continues to perform to this day their unique blend of bebop, fusion jazz, pop and doowop to enthusiastic audiences all over the world.

Though not primarily a singles group Manhattan Transfer did have a handful of hits the biggest of which was ""The Boy From New York City"". This fabulous remake of the 1964 hit by The Ad Libs peaked at #7 nationally in the summer of 1981. Furthermore, Manhattan Transfer snagged a Grammy for the ""Best Pop Vocal Group"" of 1981.

Don't get me wrong i love jamaican music/ Caribbean feels , just not with this song.

I love sia voice ,i will stick to the original version with sia only.

And she wrote all the songs.  I always felt she was a under rated writer. This cd is just as good as anything she has recorded.  And one song I think could be a hit if she would put it on another album is Wichita Falls.  Being from Wichita Falls maybe I'm a little biased.

83996,1348,16790,"Nostalgia has been a cornerstone of M83's career since the beginning. With the 1980s being a particularly ripe era for nostalgia these days, it only makes sense that the French electronic/indie band's latest album, ""Junk,"" takes inspiration from the years that seem to have informed their sound and aesthetic the most. If you felt a twinge of sadness when you learned that George Gaynes had passed earlier in the year, or if you remember a time when Dic productions ruled the TV set, ""Junk"" may be the album for you.

It would be hard to talk about ""Junk"" without comparing it (admittedly unfavorably) to 2011's mammoth double-disc ""Hurry Up, We're Dreaming."" Band leader Anthony Gonzalez aimed to outdo himself (and perhaps his peers) with the aforementioned album and succeeded in big, booming ways. Five years later, and the release of the tepid first single, ""Do It, Try It"" and it's hard not to feel disappointed at first. However, ""Do It, Try It"" appears to be a red-herring, meant to downplay any expectations, since the album quickly picks up speed with the caffeinated power-anthem ""Go!"". Teasing a little bit of that signature sax from prior hit, ""Midnight City"" before dipping into an absolutely infectious chorus from guest vocalist Mai Lin (who appears on two later tracks), it's made clear that the M83 we have come to love hasn't died or gone dormant, it's just taken on a new form.

Speaking of new, newbie band member Jordan Lawlor gets to take lead vocal duty on the smooth summer breeze of ""Walkway Blues,"" injecting some energy into the band's music while Gonzalez takes a backseat in the vocal department. Likewise, ""Time Wind"" allows Beck (yes, THE Beck) to lead the group through one of the high points on the album. Having proven himself to be one of the most diverse musicians of his generation, Beck slides into the slipstream so effortlessly, it makes one desire an M83-produced Beck album immediately (seriously, somebody make this happen!)

Like a bowl of cereal sitting in one's lap for too long during a Saturday morning cartoon binge-watch, bits of ""Junk"" tend to get a bit soggy. While brevity has never been M83's thing, the album leans on the overly-long side and starts to feel a little samey in the last third. Even still, the peaks overwhelm the valleys and while it doesn't always flow as well as the three albums preceding it, there are a number of gems in ""Junk""'s trunk. So strap on a pair of Moon Boots, ready the Lik-M-Aid and transport yourself back to a time when the ""Ghostbusters"" tearing up your local multiplex were a bunch of dudes, and enjoy the time wind.",1469232000,4
83997,3018,13116,"While I personally don't feel this album is as strong as their first, it's still miles ahead of most other Dance music being released these days. Heavy on guest appearances, those tracks feel essential and like a true partnership where others without a feature artist do not (unfortunately Sam Smith's Omen may not fall on the positive side of this equation). Overall I would still highly recommend this album and I'm looking forward to finally seeing them live at Lollapalooza this year!",1469232000,4

84011,56,18457,"If there is one thing that I have always loved about Phil Collins, is that when it has came down to his solo songs, they have been very strong, upbeat and sincere from the soul. But after his first two records which were more dormid and dark reflecting on divorce, Face Value & Hello I Must Be Going, he needed to have something more poppy and upbeat in his career. Than his landmark 1985 album, No Jacket Required came along, and earned Phil a lot of great acclaim and rewards, including Album Of The Year a the 1986 Grammy Awards. Now, looking back at Phil's legacy, I have always loved his brilliance in song, but also the choices he has made in song have been very strong. Even when he took a notorious use of Prince's music for Sussudio. The lead single from No Jacket Required, which took on a sample of Prince's 1999, actually is one of those uplifting songs that have been strong from the soul, and definitely upbeat in the rhythm at heart. It is a great song worth listening too, and one of those tracks that really was a game changer for Phil in the 80's that is still fun to listen to. If you've never heard a Phil Collins song before, well this is one I absolutely recommend.

84039,1805,13242,"I had high hopes.  They were dashed.  Upon first listen I noticed that the dynamics, the separation of sounds via level placements, were lacking.  Thats this albums biggest problem.  The musics not muddy or anything but its hard to appreciate the blend because its all set close to the same level.  Want to snack on some guitargotta listen for them.  Wanna gush over the bass lines--youre going to have to swim through seas of cymbals.  Even the drums, which are more evident, still can be washed out if you're not paying attention.  The only thing that doesnt suffer is LaTorres vocals.  Theyre front and center and easy to pick out (and Im fine with that) but though he can mine Tate at times, perhaps hes doing this too often now and isn't developing his own voice, his range is a lot more limited than I realized.

It took me several listens to appreciate any one of the songs and I had to pay attention more than I wanted to (or thought that I should have to) in order to develop even a moderate like of some of them.  Bulletproof is the easy obvious stand-out track and the first three songs are decent but past this its pretty mediocre (excepting, for my tastes, the mellow Just Us which refreshingly gets the dynamics right and is a far better song for it).  If the ryche leaves us in this condition and doesnt develop more consistent dynamics then Im afraid this human might not continue to be a part of their condition.",1469232000,3

Literally with my finger hovering over the purchase button. As soon as heard it I e-mailed Robert. We talked for a full day back and forth about this record. Robert's vision of the earth after we are no longer here as a species. Asking the question ""what will we leave behind""? It is a stunning album. It weaves in and out of the melancholy and the empty. Moody serene pieces mixed in with almost industrial like spaces between that are cold and barren. I think it's one of his best in recent years, and that's saying allot. It's been for sale on his web-sight in cd form since early April. robertrich.com. If your a RR fan it's a must! He did tell me his next album will be a ""sister"" record to this one. After 20 years of listening to Robert and owning everything he has ever released, I put this in my top 3 of his albums. With over 40 albums and over 30 years he makes a masterpiece of idea and sound. I'll never leave Robert behind:)",1469232000,5

Jimmy joined Motown in 1961 and spent most of his time as a backup singer for other artists. Shortly thereafter he was drafted. When he returned in 1964 he was a finalist for an open slot in The Temptations. History records that he lost out to his brother David.

In 1966, Jimmy heard a song about unrequited love that had written for The Spinners, and persuaded the writers that he should record it himself. ""What Becomes of the Brokenhearted"" became a huge national hit peaking at #7 on the Billboard Hot 100. Some 26 years later in 1992 the British singer/songwriter Paul Young released a cover version of this song. It was not a bad record but the original is much better.

Fran does a great job singing on this one and all the instruments are well produced here, especially the bass guitar . There is no filler and all the songs are enjoyable .

It was perplexing that after 1 gold ""All I Have"" and 1 platinum, ""Touch"" album, Sony didn't release ""Because I Love It"" in the states. I ended up buying the import. Isn't an artist doing something right if there second album is bigger than the first? Even more perplexing, ""Because I Love It"" continues upward growth musically. Def Jam picks her up for ""In Love & War"", I naively thought her career was back on track. To no avail. ""In Love & War"" is a little edgier and rocks.....but, again Def Jam mirrored Sony and dropped the ball. Since L.A. Reid signed her at Def Jam, he ironically goes to Epic/Sony, her first label group.
Were it not for me checking her Wikipedia page, I wouldn't have known that ""Drive"" was released 2 mos. ago. The. Lady is hot, makes great music videos....yet, her career keeps stumbling.  The majors like Sony or Def Jam no longer commands the marketshare they once had"". But going indie may allow artistic freedom, but, rarely are strong enough to beat the radio promotion game. So Ameriie looks like a ""one or two hit wonder"".. She deserves bette than this. Hard to judge ""Drive"" on my first listening.....but, i don't feel compelled to skip tracks.

84179,15386,1379,Ive read the lyrics to this song and Im still not sure what its about. This is more of their new sound (Post Beautiful Tragedy). In This Moment has a very unique sound and this is a continuance of that. This is what I would classify as Goth Metal. The only complaint I have is there are no happy songs. O.K. That was a joke. This is one of the best tracks on the album and there are several songs that stand out against the rest.,1469318400,5

84222,8994,18432,"Dave Davidson has become the most reliable artist in modern metal as Revocation continues to crank out great albums. Great Is Our Sin continues this trend as Dave and the boys rip it up on the newest offering. There is nothing all that different going here- still sounds like a Revocation album with lots of fast thrash/death riffs and tight double bass drumming from new skinsman Ash Pearson. The middle tracks are where this album peaks with the rapid fire ""Communion"" , insane instrumental ""The Exaltation"" (featuring ex-Megadeth Marty Friedman), and the pummeling ""Profanum  Vulgus"".  As expected, the solos do not disappoint,  with Dave delivering all but three on the album. I will say that the song structures don't vary as much as they may have on previous works - not as many of the lush interludes or jazzy soloing escapades, but this focus does not detract from the songs or solos at all.  There is a bit of a left turn with ""Cleaving Giants of Ice"" - much slower and more mellow than usual with some clean Ghost - like gang vocals. Not my favorite track, but glad to see some variation in the proven Revocation formula. For the most part, this is very heavy and fast, and while there are some clean vocals, 95% of it is Dave screaming/growling. Don't worry- they are not going soft by any means, which they prove by ending this superb slab of steaming metal with a Slayer cover!!! Like I said already, Dave Davidson is a huge artistic force in extreme/tech/thrash/death/prog/whatever metal and I will continue to check out whatever he's serving up, and so should you!",1469318400,5

84250,12631,1082,"Lee Dorsey was an R&B singer from New Orleans who had about half a dozen hit singles between 1961 and 1967. After a couple of unsuccessful releases he had a chance meeting with the legendary New Orleans songwriter and record producer Allen Toussaint. Shortly thereafter, he recorded ""Ya-Ya"" a song inspired by a children's nursery rhyme. It would become a Top Ten smash peaking at #7 nationally In October 1961..",1469404800,4

84255,3671,18472,"You can clearly tell that the band is pulling a ""Metallica"" like they did on their ""Black Album"". Toning down their heaviness in favor of a more catchy straight forward mainstream appeal. Sadly, the band doesn't do this very well like Metallica did. The band strays pretty far from their old Metalcore roots and it is extremely noticeable. The band goes for a dare I say.......Pop sound. Simply put, this album is way too soft for what this group has offered in the past. There are some moments that remind me of their previous work but they end up coming off as tame and like they're trying to make an angry song when it's not really suppose to be angry. It's not the worst album I've ever listen to but if you're hoping for a rockin' album to head bang to then you may be disappointed.",1469404800,2

In 1968 Capirol records released a single called ""I Love You"" that had originally been recorded by The Zombies and released in August 1965 as the B-side of the single ""Whenever You're Ready"". That record went absolutely nowhere in the U.S. and the tune had been largely forgotten until early 1968 when People decided to record a cover version. ""I Love You"" did quite well in the USA peaking at #14 and selling more than a million copies worldwide. It was also a hit in Japan, Australia, Mexico and Canada. Once you know that the tune was originally a Zombies song it seems so obvious. I just don't know why I never made the connection. It fun to hear this again after all these years.",1469404800,4

84318,12631,1561,"""The goal of Motown was clear in the logo they printed on their record jackets: ""The Sound of Young America"". It was no longer about black and white. The lucrative market was teenagers and it was biracial. Berry Gordy understood that in this climate the music would have to change, too, and he would have to introduce ""a brand new beat"", a new sound. He was in search of the Motown sound. And it would have to be a sound that would work well on small transistor radios and car radios, their radios."" -- pp. 85-86 ""Ready For A Brand New Beat: How ""Dancing In The Street"" Became The Anthem For a Changing America""

If there was one thing Berry Gordy Jr. was not looking for it was controversy. As spring melted into summer in 1964 Motown records was well on its way to becoming the most successful independent record label in America. Gordy had perfected a formula for churning out bright, exciting pop tunes that appealed to teens of all races. On July 31, 1964 Motown released a pulsating new single by Martha and the Vandellas. It was supposed to be a party song. What Berry Gordy could not have possibly known was that ""Dancing In the Street"" would become the anthem for the young people who would take to the streets in the years that followed protesting everything from racial discrimination, our escalating involvement in Vietnam and police brutality.

Just two days after ""Dancing In the Street"" was released, events took place that would eventually lead to the escalation of the war in Vietnam. In 1964, 17 year olds comprised the largest age group in America. These young people were still too young to vote but they quickly came to the realization that as soon as they turned 18 they could be drafted to fight in a war in Southeast Asia. Meanwhile, more than 700 college students travelled to the Deep South to help register black voters in what would come to be known at the Mississippi Freedom Summer. In just a matter of days three of these young people would turn up missing and eventually be found dead. Meanwhile, riots erupted in Harlem after a 15 year old African-American male was shot and killed by a white policeman. Similar outbursts would occur in Elizabeth, NJ, Chicago and in Jacksonville, FL. Then in February, 1965 the black human rights activist Malcolm X was gunned down in New York City. He was 39. Malcom X never bought into the civil rights movement and had urged every black person to own a gun. He firmly believed that ""only violence or the threat of violence will get results."" It would not be long before cries of ""Black Power"" would supplant the non-violent protests of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Tensions were mounting and the carefree existence that most of America's teenagers had known was quickly evaporating. Still, for the vast majority of American teenagers ""Dancing In the Street"" was nothing more than an up-tempo dance tune. But for those who were not content to remain silent, for those who took to the streets, ""Dancing In The Street"" took on an entirely new meaning. As the author recalls: ""Unknown to Reeves, the theme song of these disruptions around the country, or ""cross the nation,"" just like ""Burn, baby, burn"" in Watts was ""Dancing In The Street"". Strangely, the uprisings, too, often took on a party spirit."" To this day, Martha Reeves insists that it was nothing but a party song.

 All these years later and for a variety of reasons, ""Dancing In The Street"" remains one of the most popular tunes to emerge from the 1960's. The tune sounds as fresh and vibrant today as it did the day that it was recorded. To date, there have been some 35 cover versions of this tune. And if you would like to learn more about all of these events I would highly recommend Mark Kurlansky's excellent book to you.",1469404800,5

84420,15595,18490,"AliaVox heritage has just re-released this recording, made in 1994 but originally released in 1997.

Largely by Savall's stated intent attempt to take us back to performance standards and dynamics of ""Eroica"" upon its premiere in 1803, this version will likely provide you with an experience of Beethoven's 3rd like few others. In that sense, its just brilliantly executed: Through his choice of tempi (predominantly--although not slavishly--following Beethoven's metronome markings), through the balance of orchestral forces, and through his emphasis on dramatic flair and (dare I say it?) ""shock and awe"", as opposed to profundity.

In my opinion all these suit his purpose. It is entirely welcome, and entirely successful. He encourages us to imagine what the first audiences would have felt upon hearing this piece; if you shift in your chair and are made vaguely, if not strongly, uncomfortable, he's succeeded.

Will it be the only ""Eroica"" you'll want in your collection? most likely not. There is so much in this music that conductors and orchestras will never get to the end of creating new perspectives, if they try. I am bowdlerizing something Von Karajan observed when he said ""the great this about these deep wells of music is that you can always dip your bucket into them and come up with fresh water."" Nowhere is this more true than with Eroica. I have so much worthy versions of this masterpiece I have lost count, and in each I hear something different.

Yet, its a worthy task for someone to try to help us understand this music in a time and place, without all the trappings and notions that have been overlaid upon it over the past 215 years. Savall and his crew pulled up the bucket and gave us a particularly bracing sip of water from the well. Having said all that, I am impressed with how well each of the movements--and the piece in its entirety--captures the many emotions that more recent conductors have found in it. I am not in agreement with those reviewers here who feel he's stolen the soul of the piece or rushed through it (purely) for the shock value. For example, rarely have I heard the funeral march played with such feeling.

Highly recommended.",1469491200,5

84480,3202,17930,"I have been a fan of Hornsby's music from the beginning with ""The Way It Is"" back in 1986. I saw him live at Fiddler's Green in Denver, Colorado in August 1988 for the ""Scenes From the Southside"" tour. He was fantastic.

Hornsby has dealt with the Best New Artist Grammy curse well. While he isn't as popular as he was 1986-1990, he has maintained his artistic integrity, earning the respect of die-hard fans. Unlike Elton John (who I like), Hornsby hasn't cranked out schlock. Unlike Billy Joel (who I also like), Hornsby has kept going. To me, Hornsby is the best piano player in popular music, period.

So here is ""Rehab Reunion"", Hornsby's first album in seven years, since 2009's ""Levitate"". This time he dispenses with technology, avoids the piano altogether, and pretty much goes acoustic throughout. This radical approach serves him well. In fact, if labels were tossed around you could call ""Rehab Reunion"" 'Americana' sounding.

Hornsby has retained his humor with ""Tipping"" and ""TSA Man"", his intellectual noodlings ""Hey Franz Kafka"", and his ability to tell stories ""Over the Rise"", ""Soon Enough"", ""M.I.A. in M.I.A.M.I."", ""Rehab Reunion"", ""Tropical Cashmere Sweater"" and ""Celestial Railroad"". To me, a new version of ""The Valley Road"" could have been left off in favor of the bonus track only found on iTunes. ""The Valley Road"" is completely re-imagined, and to be honest, I still prefer the original version on ""Scenes From the Southside"".

""Rehab Reunion"" has an uplifting, playful spirit about it. Something new. It has an organic feel that hasn't been present since 1990's ""A Night on the Town"" album. It's refreshing and invigorating. Now I just wonder if it will be another seven years before we get another Hornsby album (much too long!)

Here's how ""Rehab Reunion"" compares to Hornsby's other works:

1986 The Way It Is: Four Stars
1988 Scenes From the Southside: Four Stars
1990 A Night on the Town: Four Stars

84521,12631,2244,"For those of us who were teenagers in the 1960's the news of the sudden passing of Davy Jones a few years back came as quite a shock. For a couple of years in the mid 1960's the group known as The Monkees was nothing short of a national phenomenon. Davy Jones, Peter Tork, Mickey Dolenz and Michael Nesmith became household names virtually overnight. Their debut single ""Last Train To Clarksville"" was released in September of 1966 and would go all the way to #1 on the Billboard charts. That very same month ""The Monkees"" TV show debuted on NBC and just a few weeks later ""The Monkees"" LP was released and would go on to top the national charts for 13 weeks! Producer Don Kirshner would spare no expense in providing quality material for his sensational new group. The Monkees would record tunes by such notable writers as Cynthia Weil and Barry Mann, Neil Diamond and Carole King and Gerry Coffin to name but a few. Meanwhile, Kirshner also employed a number of the top studio musicians of the day to help to make these records. Over the next couple of years The Monkees would boast a total of a half dozen Top Ten singles and four #1 albums. Over the decades their most enduring recording continues to be the phenomenal 1967 hit ""Daydream Believer"". Here's to everyone who contributed to this record in any way (and there were a lot of people). This is the crme de la crme of 1960's pop.",1469577600,5

The collection continues to feature Dial-A-Song tunes and the results feel much more natural and interesting. Tracks like ""I Love You for Psychological Reasons"" and ""Say Nice Things About Detroit"" continue the duo's tradition of bizarre yet humorous lyrics and catchy melodies. We're also treated to their stunning cover of ""Bills Bills Bills"", the popular Destiny's Child song that drove me crazy back in the 90's. Here they've made it not only listenable but insanely fun. However, it's ""Shape Shifter"" that makes the album for me. It's a classic slice of TMBG with an earworm melody and wonderfully irreverent lyrics. This album is worth it just for that tune alone.

This is a fine collection and one that should please fans both old and new. It lacks the consistency that made some of their previous records so memorable but there's more than enough here to tide us over until their next project arrives.",1469577600,4

84591,56,17265,"When it has came down to movie songs for Disney, lately they honestly just have not been able to thrive in the way they used to back years ago, and all the way through to the 80's and 90's, with massive success for films like Toy Story, The Lion King and Beauty & The Beast. But lately, a lot of the movie songs have been less than strong to the ability they have used to. Today, unfortunately, songs like Sia's version of Nat King Cole & Natalie Cole's Unforgettable from Finding Dory, really fell below the massive standards that Disney had been known for before. Pink is another example who has also been suffering from that lag too. She had some really good songs that fit nicely for films like Charlie's Angels 2, and when she did Lady Marmalade for Moulin Rogue with others like Christina Aguilera and Mya. Just Like Fire from the Alice In Wonderland film with Johnny Depp, doesn't actually deliver in the magic, the way that Disney had that movie & Song like Colors Of The Wind from Pocahantas. I really didn't feel she was driven in song and heart, they way she was recently in songs like True Love. This is a fair download for die hard Pink fans, but for newcomers to her music. Maybe they should go to a song like Stupid Girls or Don't Let Me Get Me instead.

84594,12631,2675,"Bobby Hebb was a black singer/songwriter/multi-instrumentalist born in Nashville in 1938. Bobby had the distinction of being featured at the Grand Ole Opry at the age of 12 in 1950. In June 1966 Philips records released a tune that Bobby had written called ""Sunny"". It became an immediate smash hit. Within just a couple of months Bobby Hebb found himself as the opening act for both The Yardbirds and The Beatles. Sunny electrified audiences in 1966 when Bobby Hebb toured with The Beatles bringing to that series of shows a hit as powerful as anything written or recorded by the Fab Four..

During that 1966 Beatles tour Bobby Hebb garnered almost as much appreciation from the audience as The Beatles. With the opening guitar twang/strum that preceded Hebbs voice, and with Bobbys authoritative pitch singing the magic word Sunny, waves of applause and shrieks of approval cascaded on whichever stadium or concert hall these artists appeared at. Yet, as is so often the case, fame was fleeting for Bobby Hebb. His follow-up record ""A Satisfied Mind"" barely cracked the Top 40 nationally and for all intents and purposes he was never heard from again.",1469577600,5

I agree with some reviewers who claim that these are not all the best recordings in the world.  But how would you know what is good if you have nothing to compare it to?
These are great for those who do not want to invest a ton of money into classical albums individually or who have no idea of what type of classical they would enjoy the most.  This give people that opportunity.
For me it is a great way to just get the music themed without having to go through my collection and set up playlists.",1469577600,5

84645,12631,18518,"In early 1959 a young Detroit entrepreneur named Berry Gordy Jr. decided that he was going to start his own record company. His idea was a simple one really. He was going to make records with black artists that appealed to the largest segment of the record buying public which in those days was suburban white teenagers. His formula worked to perfection. So much so that more than 50 years later ""The Motown Sound"" is still a significant force in American popular music.

In the 1960's Motown billed itself as ""The Sound of Young America"". It most certainly was. You could not listen to a Top 40 station in those days for more than 10 or 15 minutes without hearing a Motown hit. It was a great time to be a teen! It all began with a young R&B singer/songwriter from Mississippi named Barrett Strong. ""Money (That's What I Want)"" is a song written by Tamla founder Berry Gordy and Janie Bradford. Strong recorded it in 1959 for Motown's Tamla label. The song would become Motown's very first hit record spending a total of 17 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 and peaking at #23. I guess you could say that ""Money"" is the root of all Motown.",1469577600,4

84649,2191,17438,"National Park Soundscapes is the fourth in a series of albums inspired by national parks of the United States from Jill Haley, an award-winning composer, pianist, oboist and English horn player. Comprised of twelve compositions spanning fifty minutes, she is joined throughout by David Cullen on guitar and bass, Tony Deangelis on percussion and snare drum, Dana Cullen on horn, and Graham Cullen on cello. An accompanying photographical booklet details the various landmarks across the country, from which each compositions theme and title draws its inspiration.

Located in Ohios Cuyahoga Valley National Park, The Ledges is named for its ancient sandstone formations inside a hemlock forest. This leisurely piece opens up slowly with gentle piano, followed by English horn and subtle percussive elements. Possessing a soothing, solemn sound, Jills horn is subtly contrasted by the fluidity and lightness of her piano. The more uplifting Prairie Grass Dance follows next, a piece named for South Dakotas Badlands National Park. Characterized by acoustic guitar and horn, the piece moves along at a rhythmic pace while exuding a distinctly Americana feel, as the guitar-strumming and upbeat melody captures the exuberant warmth of a sunny day. My favorite composition is Waters of Acadia, which is named for Maines glorious Acadia National Park. This piece begins with the gentle sound of a rainstick followed by softly cascading piano and glistening chimes, which collectively mimic the flow of water. A stunning piece that captures the enchanting array of colors characteristic of Northeastern terrain, extended horn notes and a repeating piano riff throughout lend themselves to the compositions rejuvenating, tranquil atmosphere. Located in Virginia is Shenandoah National Park, for which Shenandoah Stillness is named. This notably earthy piece opens with a bold piano melody that resonates richly throughout, as interwoven acoustic guitar provides an added dimensional layer to the composition. Named for the giant redwood trees of Mariposa Grove that are located in Californias famous Yosemite National Park, Mariposa Sanctuary captures its picturesque beauty. A lilting piano melody opens this piece, which is eventually joined by horn and oboe, as one can easily imagine taking a stroll through the parks mountainous and thickly-forested terrain. Waves of Wind is another notable piece that deviates slightly from the other compositions. Inspired by Utahs Bryce Canyon National Park, piano and oboe are set to a waltzing rhythm, as cello and twangy guitar add a drier element to the composition. Moving along at a galloping pace, this piece brings to mind that of horseback riding along rugged terrain, as its musical elements perfectly capture the regions arid climate. Closing out the album on a somewhat somber note is A Soldiers Sacrifice, a piece inspired by Pennsylvanias Valley Forge Historical Park. Led by the marching pace of a snare drum along with sparse piano and English horn, the compositions distinctly patriotic tone makes for a most fitting conclusion.

Perfectly capturing the essence of some of the most awe-inspiring and breathtaking American landscapes, National Park Soundscapes plays out like a cross-country musical road map. Being especially fond of geography, as well as possessing a love of travel, the brief overviews given for each of the compositions were also a welcome educational experience, as I found myself researching, especially, the locations and history a few of the lesser-known national parks. Bordering on new age, contemporary instrumental and Americana music with classical overtones, the stellar compositions on this album felt overall grounding, connected to Earth and organic in nature, serving as a reminder with every walk, step and turn of just how much natural beauty and wonder exists throughout the United States!",1469577600,5

84653,15625,18519,"A solid recording of a tremendously difficult opera. It's a pity Kathleen Battle doesn't quite make it up to the high E in Durch Zrtlichkeit. This is probably not entirely her fault, since one imagines there must have been at least one good take (or not enough takes) they could have used. Still, it's preserved here for all eternity on record, and does kind of mar the overall production. Otherwise, Gruberova seems to me to be in her prime, and even Gosta Weinberg is better than I had expected. He and Peter Schreier both have some good recordings out there and some that maybe should have been made five years earlier. All in all, a worthy set for your collection.

In July 1992 Motown released ""End of the Road"".  The song would spend an amazing 33 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 and was the #1 song in the land for 13 weeks.

84729,12631,5059,"It was a time like no other in the history of American popular music. For a period that spanned roughly half a decade (1958-1964) folk music emerged from the coffee houses and college campuses of this nation and became an integral part of the mainstream music scene. Some of this music was quite intense but most of the songs that made it to the airwaves were light and upbeat. The Rooftop Singers were a folk group from New York City led by Erik Darling. Darling had been a member of The Tarriers (""Cindy, Oh Cindy"" and ""The Banana Boat Song"") in 1956 and later on sang with The Weavers for a few years. In early 1963 the folk label Vanguard released the single ""Walk Right In"" which was a very fine folk update of a 1929 country blues song written by musician Gus Cannon and originally recorded by Cannon's Jug Stompers. The song turned out to be one of the biggest hits of the folk era spending a couple of weeks high atop the Billboard Hot 100. Over the years ""Walk Right In"" has been recorded by dozens of artists across a number of genres. The Rooftop Singers' version appears on the soundtrack of the Tom Hanks film ""Forrest Gump"".  This is the original recording you would remember from the radio.",1469664000,5

84760,1484,16718,"The Heavy return with a heavy hitting album in 2016. Like most, I've been a fan ever since catching these guys on the Late Show with Letterman where they played ""How you like me now"" and ""What makes a good man"" and I have been looking forward to hearing them put together a new album since.

Finally it comes, and ... well, nothing really sticks out like the previous two mentioned songs, but in different ways there is some great songs here that would definitely be welcomed around the set of the previous hits. Saying that, it's kind of hard to put this band into a category of what exactly their style is... as they seem to take on many styles, mix them up and what not, but unlike many bands, these guys make it work!

Some songs sound kind of generic ok, like the first two tracks... they are nothing special, but have that kind of ""Robert Randolph"" thing going... you know, it's not memorable, but it's good while it's playing, then you forget it, but if you hear it again it's like, ""Oh yeah, that one""... nothing bad about it, it's not filler, but it's not great, but it's ok if you know what i'm saying?

The best tracks here for me are ""Not The One"", ""The apology"", ""Nobodys hero"", ""Miss California"", ""Ghost"", ""Mean ole Man"" and if you have the bonus track, ""Panic Attack"" which some seem to be getting a low score on for some reason? Dunno if its me or whats happening there?

It's a real shame we're living in times where only R&B music is being paid by the record companies to be shoved down 12 year old girls throats and those who don't know what music really is. Because these guys here really deserve to have their music played everyday and not just be seen occasionally on a guest spot on tv or heard in a movie now and then. These guys are band flying low under the radar that should be soaring high and being taken notice of.",1469750400,4

84784,7258,18533,"Thank you Scientist is one of the best newer bands on the planet. They are a seven piece band that includes sax, violin, and trumpet in addition to the regular rock lineup (drums, bass, guitar, vocals). How they integrate all this together without getting sloppy is what makes them amazing. Their previous release blew me away with its raw aggression and energy. This release shows the band growing by trying things differently. For me, the energy is still strong but overall the compositions are more polished favoring melody rather than a stripped down sound and it works. The musicianship and arrangements are stellar, exciting, and the changes within songs evolve so you never lose interest. This is not music for the timid as one moment you can be swept away with a smooth groove and only seconds later are transported into a frenzy of shredding insanity. Love it! I admit this album may be a grower and may take a few listens to full appreciate all the nuances, but the first couple of listens have me impressed and put a silly grin on my face that makes me want to listen to this over and over.

I reviewed Russ Hewitts debut recording, ""Bajo El Sol,"" in early 2009, and absolutely loved it (still do!), and included it on my Favorites list for the year. Hewitts second release, ""Alma Vieja,"" came along in 2011 and was a Favorite for that year as well. Five years later, here comes ""Cielo Nocturno"" (Night Sky), and guess what - its even better than the two earlier releases! There are plenty of great composer/guitarists out there, but I have to say that Russ Hewitt is one of my top five favorites. His unique musical voice comes partly from his classical training, but is possibly even more influenced by his travels, sitting in with musicians all over the world. Hewitt originally called his music nuevo flamenco, and that is still a very big part of his musical style, but that style has expanded to an even broader Latin world music genre that incorporates elements of jazz as well as classical, rock, and a variety of cultural influences. In other words, Russ Hewitts music is impossible to pigeon-hole - always a plus, in my opinion! Hewitt has a unique musical vision and the playing chops to express whatever he chooses to express. He also has some very impressive guest artists that include Larry Carlton, Ardeshir Farah, Alfredo Caceres, and Bob Parr. Cielo Nocturno is eleven tracks of musical magic, all of which were composed by Russ Hewitt.

The rhythmic and joyful Presidio gets ""Cielo Nocturno"" started with a big musical grin, letting the listener know that he or she is getting into something very special. Samba Sao Paulo brings a smooth and sophisticated attitude, but it still sounds like fun! The addition of accordion (Vladimir Kaliazine) changes the musical flavor of Serenidad a bit, and what a tasty bit that is! I really love this one! San Elizario is a city in Hewitts home state of Texas, and his musical tribute is bright and vibrant. North of Home features guitarist Larry Carlton and has been released as the first single from this album - guitar-driven smooth jazz with a strong Latin influence. The tropical Arenas Blancas (White Sands) is warm, breezy, and very relaxing. Cervezas and Cigars is party music, pure and simple - and another favorite. I think youd have to tie your foot to your chair to keep it from tapping to the rhythm! Hewitts lightning-fast fingers never slow down on this one! The gently-swaying rhythms of Um Abraco Do Bossa give a pleasant interlude, as does the beautiful Brisa de Monte. Persian Sky cranks the intensity back up and features Ardeshir Farah of Strunz and Farah. What a powerhouse of guitar virtuosity with both Farah and Hewitt pulling out all the stops! Hike to La Cruz is a gorgeous closing track for a truly great album.

If you are not yet familiar with Russ Hewitt, you need to fix that right now! I give ""Cielo Nocturno"" my highest recommendation!",1469750400,5
84804,56,9100,"It is honestly so sad when a artist has became so overexposed, that they haven't been able to shine the way the used to when they were younger. Unfortunately, Beyonce' Knowles has been one of those artists that has been so severely overplayed, and overexposed like a robot that is too much, that she has just been not worth listening to anymore. The only talent she had was when she was a part of Destiny's Child. But on her own, she has oversaturated the market where it has been too much about her, and no one else. When she was starting to get out on her own, she had one or two songs, but that was it. Her collaborations with her husband though, not even exciting. Her song Deja Vu from her 2005 album B' Day, has not been impressive, trying to recapture the chemistry she one had with him on Crazy In Love, and sadly she does not impress at all. I really did not enjoy the song, and sadly it is not worth listening to, especially when it has been overplayed so many times. If you are really new to Beyonce' Knowles music, go back and listen to when she did have talent as a part of Destiny's Child.

84835,1897,17592,"Drake has a standard style to all his songs.  It usually involves him trying to be soft-spoken ladies man trying to woo his next conquest.  He often incorporates an atypical music component and, sometimes, has a featured female singer.  ""One Dance"" has all those 'Drake-ian' elements to it and the result is uninspiring.  The heavy-duty Drake fans won't listen to such blasphemy (after all, they did push it to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100), but an objective analysis has to be honest.

  Drake's chosen musical component is an odd, auto-tuned series of exotic horns that seem over-produced.  While this part is mediocre, the real shortcoming is featured singer, Kyla.  While Kyla appears to have been around for several years and has had some success in the industry, her contribution to ""One Dance"" is just bad.  Her 'verses' simply do not match the flow of the song.  They are slow and disjointed and she is also trying too hard to be sexy.",1469750400,2
84836,4505,18533,"This band in awesome! I'm not even normally into this kind of sound, but they do things with sound like Picasso did with paint. They sort of have a 1970's sound completely with a brass section morphed into modern alt rock. I think I even heard a cello in there at one point. (I know...it sounds like an odd combo. But they make it work)

It's just a really awesome and remarkably unique sound. It's all very high energy. I mean VERY high energy. I'm listening to this at work and I'm having a hard time sitting down while I listen to this.

The vocals and lyrics aren't bad, but the real strength of the band if the instrumentation and how they make so many different sounds work so well together.

They kind of remind me of Pillar, especially comparing Pillar's Frontline to this album's Need More Input. (Except more brass instruments on this album)  So if you're familiar with Pillar, hopefully that comparison means something to you.

Usually one or two songs sound good and I buy those. But, at least half of the songs are great. And, two or three more and really good. I just listened to it again today. Give this one a try, I am sure you will like some of the songs. The record label was smart and put something on it for everyone. Or, at least 90 percent of everyone. Give it a go. And, definitely go and see Ghostbusters!",1469836800,5

84890,15657,18022,It's amazing how just a couple of days ago no one really had any reviews for this awesome song! Now it's blowing up quick. This was my first time listening to Twenty One Pilots and I must admit... I'm hooked. IT may be just me but there is something so deep and profound about not only the lyrics but the beat as well. I can not stop playing this song (especially when I feel like no one understands me)  and I can clearly see this and a few other songs on this album being the sound track to the creepiest horror movie ever. Usually I wait until an album comes out on Prime to cop it. However as soon as the full album drop I will be buying it. Listen to this song and feel how it pulls you in.... Thank you so much for taking time out to read my review. I hope you found it helpful. If so please mark helpful.,1469836800,5

This album sounds so fresh and real and is so simple to understand and relate to. It truly uplifted me spiritually and has been an encouragement to me in my Christian walk!!! Being a Christian musician myself I have always enjoyed & admired Steven's abilities to write and arrange and produce his albums. This album is a shining example of God's man using the gifts God has blessed him with to his fullest to draw others to exalt and worship The LORD of ALL Creation!!! If you're going to try one out listen to this album! I am truly blessed by the message and direction of this album!,1469836800,5

84912,3942,15683,"I'm Loving this album!!  The Cult have long been my personal favorite band...I discovered them way back in '87, when I ran across their black ""Love"" album in the record shop racks.  I'd never heard of The Cult or heard any songs on that album.  Bought it and ""Electric"" on visual appearance alone.  It was a major find for me personally.  Loved every song on both of those early albums and immediately recorded to a 90 minute Maxell cassette tape and continually played...until later getting the CD's...I still play 'em.  I'm not saying this group is better than Led Zeppelin, I'm trying to say Led Zeppelin had already been discovered by all of my running mates by the tyme I started listening to them.  But, I discovered The Cult and was responsible for turning my circle of friends to The Cult.  That is my story of why The Cult are my personal favorite band.

I really liked their '12 ""Choice Of Weapon"" release, but even so, it didn't do for me what ""Love"" '85; ""Electric"" '87 & ""Sonic Temple"" '89 do for me.  But, far as a complete album, I'd say it was the closest to reaching that height since their ""Ceremony"" '91 release.

""Hidden City"" '16 is the most even flowing release since ""Ceremony"" in my opinion.  I have to admit, I just didn't ever care for ""The Cult"" '94 & ""Beyond Good And Evil"" '01.  Now that I'm older, maybe I need to revisit those two and re-familiarize myself with those two, maybe I missed something.  In my opinion every song on the new release is quality hard rock of the nature of what the band was putting out between '85 & '91.  Good lyrics and really enjoyable musical arrangements and structure.  This is one of those albums that as I hear track 1, I think this is really great, but then the next song comes on and I immediately say this is even better and that just continues from song to song until we're back at track 1.  I'd like to tell you which songs stand out, but really they are all very equal to me.  ""In Blood"" is probably the first song that seemed to stand above the rest.  Really liked the slower flow along with the vocal delivery, but quickly that was replaced by ""Lilies"" and their line 'turn these bruises into wine'.  Now I'm drawn to ""Birds Of Paradise"", ""Hinterland"" and ""Deeply Ordered Chaos"".  I really think if you are familiar with Ian and Billy and some of their catalog with The Cult, you'll find this album easy to play and enjoy.

I didn't make any mention of their ""Born Into This"" '07 release.  I did like that release, Xspecially ""Dirty Little Rock Star"", but overall the album wasn't as flowing, but that is just my opinion.  I wanted to hear more songs that were like ""DLRS"" as it is probably my favorite Cult song since ""The Witch""...just stood head and shoulders over the other tracks on the album.

84959,4136,17302,"One of the things that made Meghan Trainors debut album stand out from the crowd was the fantastic lyrics mixed with that old time doo whop sound. This is something that this album is missing terribly, while I understand the need to progress with your sound and try new things your lyrics should never suffer in the process. Most of the tracks featured here are sadly generic with juvenile lyrics that keep the songs from flowing well together. When listening to the album each song sounds like it belongs on a different album, which causes it to seem like Meghan didn't know what direction she wanted to go in resulting in a directionless in cohesive album. Don't get me wrong there are some good songs here such as the beyond catchy""ME TOO"" that grabs you with that ear worm hook, as well as the beautiful ""KINDLY CALM ME DOWN"" which I must say Meghan really shines vocally on. But as a total package I feel that this is a step back for Meghan that struggles to meet the vibrancy of her debut",1469836800,3

85009,12282,18561,"Hearing the soundtrack to the 1990's ""Jeeves and Wooster"" TV series makes one realize just how brilliant Anne Dudley's 1920's-inspired musical score for the series actually was.  Her indebtedness to the musical styles of the jazz age (which originated, of course, in the United States and were then exported to the England of the show's setting) is obvious, as is her indebtedness to English composers of the twentieth century like Ralph Vaughn Williams (hear track #11, ""A Weekend in the Country"").  The syncopated title theme makes the listener want to get up and dance, while tracks like ""The Amateur Dictator"" (the character Sir Roderick Spode was a satire of Sir Oswald Mosley) leave one in awe of their subtlety.  Interspersed with the purely orchestral tracks are popular songs from the '20's/'30's -- some of them performed by Hugh Laurie (Bertie Wooster) himself -- and witty dialogues between Laurie and Stephen Fry (Reginald Jeeves); these are similar to ones heard in the series.  Expertly played, the soundtrack is a highly entertaining one to a memorable ""sitcom.""",1469923200,5

85024,4883,17860,"I am a fan of Tyler Carter, but his band just misses the mark for me... Lyrically, instrumentally, and scream-wise, it doesn't do much for me. It feels very nu-metal, which is fine... I could get behind that, if it were done decently. This all feels very campy and forced. First off, and probably most importantly, Tyler is an amazing vocalist, and for some reason, it seems that for Issues albums, they turn his vocals up SOOO high and make them all auto-tuney. It's like they want him to sound as close to Jonny Craig as possible. Its a huge bummer, because I feel that Tyler has a killer and unique voice and it gets very under-utilized by this band and makes it seem very synthetic and cheap. That being said, it also gets overshadowed by a generic post-hardcore vocalist and boring music... Check out Tyler's solo work instead. Also, the lyrics for most of these songs are just... lame, Listen to ""The Realest"". The lyrics in some of these songs just make me cringe and it ruins them for me. Also, the screamer vocalist, on his own, is a good vocalist... I think that he and Tyler, together, are just sort of overkill. I'd rather just have one or the other. Having both of these singers feels very tacked on, and poorly thrown together. Having 2 vocalists is difficult, especially if they aren't utilized in interesting ways. In most songs, I find that I'll be enjoying a part, until the other singer jumps in, and kills it for me (see Coma), If you'd like to see a band that utilizes 2 singers very well, check out Dance Gavin Dance.

On top of all that, the instrumentation is pretty bland and nothing special... I did really enjoy the bass on ""The Realest"" though. All in all, I wanted to give this album a chance, in hopes that maybe Issues would have grown on me, but that is not the case.

This is just my opinion though, you may like the lame, uninspired musicianship, the Jonny Craig knock-off vocals, and the nu-metally scream raps, if not, Go listen to Dance Gavin Dance.",1469923200,2

No idea how to properly categorize it for those reading this review, but I might venture hip-hop or rap?  I'm not a big fan of either of those genres in general, but whatever they're doing, it's really good.  Look up some of the tracks on youtube if you're curious to hear a sample.",1469923200,5
85029,12213,2972,"This album is a great mixture of all the variety of music. Jazz, blues, rock, and r+b fronted by a wonderfully versatile singer. She's got grit, harmony and talent. The instrumental side is equally pleasant, unique and somehow retro. The mixing is awesome and creative. The music is mellow and vibrant.
I can say that before this album, there have been two others that I could listen to completely and not be disappointed. Kid rock Devil without a cause, and Metallica's And justice for all.
This is completely different music, also completely satisfying. Extremely well crafted music.",1469923200,5

Definitely continues some of the political overtones that started in Major/Minor, but even a little stronger here.  I don't mind these, but it does feel like Thrice and Rise Against (both great bands) are starting to merge into one sound and lyrical style in some ways.  That's fine in one way because I like both bands, but bad because I kind of liked their older sounds.  But Thrice is not a band with a static style, so I will enjoy their new work and eagerly await their next album.",1469923200,5

85041,56,15110,"When it has came down to Mariah Carey these days, it has been more about her personal life, than the stride of the music she wants to sing. It is very sad that she has not been able to honestly ignite within her songs, the way other great divas did before her like the great Whitney Houston, or Anita Baker. Tragically after she left Sony for other offers in the 90's, When she made it in the 2000's, the only album that really delivered with her fans really was The Emancipation Of Mimi, and none of the albums have been able to stride in musicality and soul. When she released her album, Memoirs Of An Imperfect Angel, it was really more of a dud than a sense of the brilliance she used to have. The songs completely have been a waste of time. Obsessed was really the only hit song for her die hard fans, but it wasn't enough. Musically, the song wasn't strong enough the way that she had with songs like We Belong Together or Shake It Off. Obsessed was a real failure, and one Mariah Carey song that really is a stinker.

85102,12905,13956,"A 1976 song about being on the road and feeling just a bit lost and out of place, ""Couldn't Get It Right"" just hooks you right in the beginning with a catchy rhythm and then never lets you go.

Written for their album Gold Plated on short notice to create a radio-playable song, it eventually topped out at #3 on the Hot 100 chart.  Apparently, the band was inspired by their time on the road, with the line about looking for signs in the night reflecting their search for a hotel with vacancies so they could sleep after a performance.

Listening to it today, it's marvelous.  Couldn't Get It Right is one of those songs that when it comes on, you think, ""Who sings that? I really like it.""  It has a great opening beat and guitar riff, with a chrous that makes you feels like a fish on a hook, drawn into singing along.

Led by singer-songwriter David Gates, Bread would amass an impressive total of nine Top 20 records during the years 1970 thru 1973.  Formed in Los Angeles in 1968, David Gates and Bread would quickly establish themselves as a force to be reckoned with on the Billboard Hot 100.  Their debut single ""Dismal Day"" failed to make the charts in 1969.  However, the group's second record ""Make It With You"" went all the way to the top of the charts in the summer of 1970. And the hits just kept on comin'.  In late March of 1971 Elektra records released the beautiful love song ""If"".  The song was an immediate hit peaking at #4 in May of that year.  As far as I'm concerned this is the best song they ever recorded.",1470009600,5

85150,1590,18567,"I confess that when Parallels was released I was not the biggest fan of this recording. At the time it just seemed like the guys took a big swing at commercial success during a time when they were just coming off of the most successful tour with the genre defining Perfect Symmetry. To some degree, they certainly had success with Parallels (both in garnering new fans and in getting plenty air time on the radio and Headbangers Ball) but things never took off for them for whatever reasons (some discussed in the documentary). So in that regard this disc always left a bit of a bittersweet taste in my mouth. But over the years Ive come to appreciate these songs and have learned to love them for what they represent. Even though Fates would not be known for melodic/commercial progressive metal, with Parallels they were, in essence, the first technical band to really make the idea stick. And so while Terry Browns original mix was solid, it was nice to have a newer ramped up version of these songs along with, of course, all of the booty that accompanied this reissue. Disc 1, not surprisingly, sounds amazing  more full and powerful, more bass vibe. Disc 2 contains the excellent live recording from the Hollywood portion of the 92 tour. The audio quality is much better here than on the DVD video shoot of the show one month later in CT. The pre-production demo tracks are definitely fans only type material.  Still, for those who prefer the stripped-down, live studio sound, these tracks are fun.

DVD
So the documentary making of is fantastic on many levels. First, I love the format of the interviews/presentation where each band member (as well as Terry Brown) gets to chime in on every topic (and does so with great insight). In addition to the expected discussions on the genesis of Parallels (the how, when, why, etc.), comments about the Parallels 92 tour (including the low point with Pantera fans) and the comical explanations behind the music video shoots, we are treated to an exegesis of sorts to each song on the album  all of which are quite in depth. Matheos even takes time to discuss the lyrical meaning/intent behind each one which, for me, was tremendously helpful. For years I always wondered why all of these songs seemed to talk about broken relationships between two people. I suspected that Leave the Past Behind was in part about the band moving on to a different style, but I didn't think it had much to do with fear of change. Interestingly this song is most like the Perfect Symmetry style, so thats cool how it bridges the two worlds of Fates Warnings past and what would become their new direction for a time. More surprising is his explanation for Eye to Eye, which I always assumed was a song about two people that don't really see eye to eye, but instead refers to the unspoken divide between fans and musicians (often over idolized by those fans who think they really know what the band is all about).  Likewise, Dont Follow Me conveys a similar don't idolize me rant. Most surprising though was the revelation that The Eleventh Hour chronicles Matheos almost walking out on the band during their Toronto sessions due to frustration with lack of inspiration. It is quite amazing then that the song became, in my opinion, the best song on Parallels. Of course, the other thing that really comes across in this documentary is how all of the guys (while so different) were able to paradoxically come together and work so well together. The live set from the tour is hit or miss. The audio isn't too bad but the video quality is marginal which makes me wonder how we ever watched anything in standard definition? Still, its a great set list and it is nice to have this moment in time, during arguably their most successful commercial period, captured on DVD.

Packaging issues aside (dont know why Metal Blade didn't stick with the Perfect Symmetry format) this reissue succeeds on many levels and the documentary imparts to fans a much better understanding of the choices and thoughts that went into the changes the band implemented with Parallels. Not surprisingly, in the end I have even greater respect for the contributions (the in-roads) they made for all of the subsequent progressive bands who have been inspired by their efforts and art. While Dream Theaters Images and Words would have a much more monumental impact on how metal and prog would mesh, it is worth remembering that No Exit, Perfect Symmetry AND Parallels had already been released.",1470009600,5

85187,9073,18472,"Well, you might have noticed that this is quite a departure from The Resistance, opting for a more streamlined approach in the songs in lieu of their concept-fueled metalcore works of the past. However, I feel that with this direction, it suits them best, as it eschews a load of the filler that plagued their previous works, but adjusted their sound just right so that it doesn't feel like a complete departure.

Aesthetically, it's not that surprising of a transition, as the recent works by the likes of Bring Me the Horizon and We Came as Romans have also displayed a similar change. However, the reason Retrograde stands out is because it comes to show that you can transition into a more radio-friendly sound and not have to sacrifice anything quality wise. I've always admired their versatility in their previous works, but with Retrograde, it covers a great amount of ground, whether it would be the high-energy rock anthem ""Zero"", the electronic/rock verse/chorus tradeoff in ""Aftermath"" the acoustic driven touch in ""Signs of Life"" or the trip-hop vibes given off in ""Oxygen"". It feels inspired and invigorated throughout, and I actually feel that getting rid of the majority of the metalcore helps out greatly, as it feels less juvenile in approach. Highly recommended if you're into the forward-thinking aspect of this band; they may have disappointed some fans with this one, but down the road, I know this direction will be the best suited for Crown the Empire. I'm anxious for the follow-up already...",1470009600,4

85259,12631,13478,"No doubt about it. When Motown pulled up stakes and moved the bulk of its operations to the West Coast in the early 1970's the center of gravity in the world of soul music shifted dramatically. But it did not, as the executives at Motown had hoped, follow them to Los Angeles. Rather, the new capitol of soul music was located about 450 miles to the south and east of Detroit in the City of Brotherly Love. For it was just about that same time that producers Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff in conjunction with CBS founded Philadelphia International Records. It would go on to become the dominant soul label for the next decade featuring artists like Harold Melvin and the Bluenotes, Billy Paul, The Three Degrees and so many others. But clearly the most important and successful group to record for Philadelphia International was The O'Jays.

Now before signing with Philadelphia International in 1972 The O'Jays had been around the block a time or two. The group was formed in 1961 and was originally known as The Triumphs. The group was renamed by Cleveland disc jockey Eddie O'Jay.  During the 1960's The O'Jays amassed a total of 10 charted singles but none made a huge splash on the Billboard Hot 100.  That would all change in July 1972 with the release of ""Backstabbers"" which would peak at #3.  It quickly became apparent that Gamble & Huff knew how to best utilize the talents of this venerable group and several more hits would follow over the next few years.",1470096000,5
85260,10246,16893,"Notice that at 2:45 into the track ""Love and Bullets"" that there are chickens clucking?

This is definitely much better than the last DD reunion album Revolve (2011), but I have a few issues. Besides Bruno's chicken little effects there are annoying generated effects(gun shots)in the mix, and filler at the album's mid point, but with Paul's excellent vocals it's hard to complain. First 3 tracks are DD 2.0 (Laine years) as the album some what deteriorates from that point but ends on a high note with the country-rock leaning ""That's When I'll Stop Loving You"" that sounds like it came from Paul Laine's last project ""DarkHorse  Let It Ride (2014)""[Not listed on HH].

The original song, ""The Safety Dance,"" is probably the epitome of goofy '80s songs... and I mean that in the best of ways.

This is a very silly and ultimately FUN song that came from an era where music was meant to be fun and enjoyable, and its funky electronic sound, silly lyrics, and catchy beat make it nearly impossible to not dance to.  I dare you to listen to this and just try to hold still...

In other words, tasteful, catchy pop tunes with some charming quirkiness.

This is definitely one of those albums that grows and grows and grows on you with repeated listens. A very impressive --- and very addictive --- collection of original material. No, there is nothing life-changing or especially musically challenging on here, but then again, great pop music like this is life-affirming in its own right! Dive in and enjoy!",1470096000,4

85291,4277,17241,"This album deserves nothing less than 5 stars. I was little skeptical with their new one because King of Limbs while it had some stellar songs, it was very short and didn't really hit me the way Radiohead albums do. This to me sounds like all their best characteristics combined though. It's hard to not compare it to their prior albums because at times it invokes the feeling of ""OK Computer"", the ambience and exploratory nature of ""Kid A/Amnesiac"", to a lesser extent ""In Rainbows"", and surprisingly I can hear the best aspects of ""Hail to the Thief"" in some places. Radiohead is a band that constantly evolves or experiments to prevent from getting stale but this isn't just another solid Radiohead album though. I would put this amongst their best albums; I've been a fan since the mid-90's to now and when I heard this the whole way through I was just taken aback at how complex, beautiful, and amazing ""A Moon Shaped Pool"" is. It's not a cookie cutter affair of trying to recapture old glory or just sounding like they've run out of ideas, it's the exact opposite. The studio version of ""True Love Waits"" is just angelic for lack of better words. The band is in top form, this is the best I've heard Thom Yorke's voice in years (or at least the best utilized) and the rest of the band is in top form creatively and with their musicianship. Having said all that, fans expecting to hear loud sonic electric guitar blaring won't find that here but the songs off the albums are Radiohead matured and maybe not outdoing themselves but coming very close in my opinion. If you're looking for the blazing guitar and heavy dynamics you'll be disappointed but really, I can'tpicture a fan of the band NOT liking this. All fans buy for sure and fans of alternative in the vein of Bjork and other eclectic artists and groups at least listen to samples. A+",1470096000,5

The lead guitar - Kanami Tono, carried all of this material whenever something was needed.  Everybody did a great job.  Lots of excellent bands are coming out of Japan.  Band-Maid is leading the straight hard rock, while BabyMetal holds down the prog kawaii metal.  If you liked New Beginnings, you will be very happy with Brand New Maid also.

After a successful 20-year career in Hollywood as a composer and music editor, Shie Rozow decided to produce an album of chamber music that wasn't tied to another persons creativity, namely a film or TV show. Working at what appears to have been top speed, he produced five works for varying instrumental groups, including solo music, a genre which he tells us he is particularly attracted to. Where the lush orchestration of movie music can mask many deficiencies, Rozow says, he was challenged by the nakedness of writing exposed scores where every detail counts and nothing is covered up.

A new wrinkle is that Rozow used crowd sourcing from kickstarter.com to finance this CD; the various contributors are thanked on the first foldout of the slimline cardboard packaging. It could be tricky to write music that will satisfy dozens of small contributors, but I cant imagine that any of Rozows investors is dissatisfied. He has a melodic gift and a Hollywood-honed ability to communicate immediately on a broad musical basis. All five works on the program go down easily but are also quite skillful. Rozows general method is to base each score on an ear-catching melody, generally accompanied by motor rhythms and arpeggiated chords that keep up the momentum. At the same time, he has a natural warmth that is adaptable to more reflective and elegiac moods.

The inspiration for Fantasia Appassionata is a survivor of Theresienstadt, Alice Herz-Sommer. Forced to perform as a pianist at show concerts for the Red Cross and other high-level visiting inspectors, Herz-Sommer was incredibly fortunate to survive the final phase of Theresienstadt, which led to the mass extermination of its inmates. She lived to 110, passing away in 2014, and Rozow tells us that his piece, written for solo piano, attempts to capture the beauty of her spirit as well as her story. Fantasia Appassionata opens with a John Williams-quality theme thats interrupted by a turbulent middle section standing for Herz-Sommers Nazi persecution, which then resolves into a calm but triumphant culmination. None of the materials Rozow employs are complex; his aim is to make us feel his subject directly, which the score certainly does.

Another solo piano work, Esms Moon, is a wistful elegy to the teenage daughter of a friend after she committed suicide. The music creates a mood of consolation rather than revisiting the tragedy. The title is taken from Esms habit as a young child of kissing everyone and everything, including the moon. Thanks to Rozows restraint, what could have been a mawkish tribute is quietly moving.

More expansive in its imaginative reach, but still very accessible, is the composers first attempt at a string quartet, Expedition, whose short movements are titled Fantasy in Flight, Destination Unknown, Journey, and Uncharted Territory. Because of the composers strong sense of visual imagery from his long experience in films, the music is evocative and generally propulsive, taking time out for short snatches of mystery and apprehension in the face of the unknown. I can easily see Expedition serving as a score for an assault on Everest.

The violist from the Lyris Quartet, who perform Expedition, was asked if hed like to record a work for solo viola roughly modeled on Bachs suites for unaccompanied violin and cello. The task that Rozow set himself, which hasn't fundamentally changed since the Baroque, was to use various techniques (pizzicato, along with double-, triple-, and quadruple-stops) to create harmonies instead of a single melodic line and actual counterpoint. Violist Luke Maurer has a beautiful tone and seamless technique, which for me makes Old Friends the most interesting work on the program, technically speaking.

The program ends with Ananke for French horn and piano, where Rozow wanted to take advantage of the various technical devices that the instrument is capable of (in line with a piece like Brittens Serenade for Tenor, Horn, and Strings). He got an education from a prominent Hollywood freelancer, Brain OConnor, who is the horn soloist on the recording. Ananke is a haunting work because of a tragic circumstance. OConnor had battled brain cancer for some time, and this proved to be his final, losing struggle with the disease. He died before the CD was issued, and one detects a touching frailty in his performance even as the music builds to its heroic central climax.

The Israeli-born Rozow, who studied in Boston and obtained his Bachelors in music at Berklee College of Music, tends to hear folksongs and dances in the back of his headoften of Eastern European and Jewish origin, if I am guessing rightly, because his melodies and rhythms echo such sources. This album represented a liberating gesture for him, and it benefits from expert performers and full, natural recorded sound. I thoroughly enjoyed everything I heard here and would give a special recommendation to aficionados of Hollywood film scores. The composer wrote the helpful program notes.",1470182400,5

We have to wait for the third song to have a little breather with a short piano part. If the vocals are very busy here, there're some serious instrumentals parts throughout .

There is an impressive balance between the brutal passages and the more delicate ones and the influences from a lot of Progressive Metal bands are obvious but with the personality of the band, it doesn't sound like a pale copy.

85355,9574,12836,"A member of one of the most famous families from Bohemia, Franz Benda (1709-1789) entered into the service of Frederick the Great in 1732. As a violin master, he played some 50,000 performances over a forty year period. He also wrote a lot of violin music, 110 solo capriccios, at least 150 sonatas, 31 duets and some 28 concertos, including this one in D Major.

With a crisply articulated intro, the Allegro ma non molto features a harpsichord continuo and string dominated orchestral support. As a transitional work from the Baroque, it contains more interplay between the single violin and the symphonic tutti than was the norm for the prevalent Italian style. Smoothly flowing, Bendas writing for the solo string is virtuosic without being showy, letting the melodic lines develop naturally. In the minor keyed Largo, the sweep of the orchestral accompaniment lends a somber weight to the throbbing vibrato of Gabriela Demeterova. With a dramatic pathos in the uppermost register, she brings a sorrowful sweetness in her tone that must be similar to the reported quality that set apart Bendas adagio playing. Horns appear for the brisk finale, a bright Allegro with bravura fiddling as the single violin drifts high on the E string.

A generation or two later, Bohemian born Vaclav Pichl (1741-1805) studied philosophy and theology in Prague before accepting a musical directorship in Milan. After 21 years, he returned to Vienna and died while playing a violin concerto at the Lobkowitz Palace.
His D Major Concerto Op. 3, No. 1 opens with a marching Allegro sostenuto, clipped and precise. While still employing the harpsichord as continuo, the writing finds even greater collaboration between the soloist and orchestra, engaging in extensive rhythmic interactions and trading melodic ideas, including one haunting echo in minor. A higher degree of technical proficiency of the single violin is also required.

A minor keyed charmer, the following Adagio finds striking support in the lower strings with a lovely countermelody while the ethereal vibrato of the solo sounds so much like the beating of angel wings. Ending the 2nd movement on an open cadence sets up a smooth transition as the resolution occurs in the sweetly pure tones from the violin, the very first notes of the concluding Rondo. Interrupting the relentless drive in the lower strings, a brief passage in minor offers a dark interlude in an otherwise cheery finale.

By another Bohemian, the final concerto represents the culmination of the Viennese High Classical style. Renowned as a teacher and violin virtuoso, Antonin Vranicky (1761-1820) composed some outstanding chamber music and challenging concertos, one of which is the C Major included on this recording.

Using tympani and winds to create a broader palette of orchestral colors, the work begins with a bold Allegro giusto. Amid a longer, more extensive development section, the soloist shines in the fiendishly difficult passage work while in the reverential Adagio that follows, the writing stretches the upper reaches of the instruments register. After a chorale like start, the weeping violin carries the movement until gentle horns lead to a serene close. Marked Alla Pollacca- Allegretto, the finale is a frisky Polish folk dance. With an appealing stutter step in the rhythm, this 3rd movement features a brief mournful interlude, dazzling flourishes from the violin and a rousing finish.

The original recording from 1995 from Supraphon is fine, placing the solo violin close enough for the intimate slower sections to be sharp and clear. Under the able artistic direction of Milan Lajcik, the Prague Chamber Orchestra brings an accomplished reading to their fellow countrymens concertos. But the spotlight rightfully belongs to the exquisite work of Gabriela Demeterova. This fine traversal of the development of the Viennese violin concerto is testimony to her artistry.",1470268800,5

85378,12631,8740,"Born Norma Egstrom on 5/26/20 in Jamestown, North Dakota Peggy Lee would have a long and highly successful career as a singer, recording artist and also in films. She spent the first several years of her career as a jazz singer for a number of big bands including Benny Goodman's. Peggy Lee would go solo in 1943. Over the next 15 years she would have more than two dozen hit singles including ""Manana"" (1948) and ""Fever"" (1958).

Little had been heard from Peggy Lee during the 1960's. Then in 1969 she came up with one of the most unlikeliest hits of the decade. Some years earlier the American songwriting team of Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller had written a tune called ""Is That All There Is"". Several artists recorded it with little or no success. Then in September 1969 Capitol released a version by none other than Peggy Lee. And for some inexplicable reason the song took off peaking at #11 on the Billboard Hot 100. It was Peggy's biggest hit in more than a decade and her last charted single. It won Lee the Grammy Award for ""Best Female Pop Vocal Performance"" and then later was named to the Grammy Hall of Fame.  This is the original hit recording that has been re-mastered for your enjoyment.",1470268800,4
85379,4277,16784,"I have been a Deftones fan since the early days and I see many reviewers wanting or expecting them to sound metal or very hard. Deftones were considered nu-metal with their debut and even ""Around the Fur"" but they are a very ahead of the curve band in general. To me, there is no bad Deftones album, ""Gore"" is an excellent album and delivered for me. ""Koi No Ykan"" was a hard album to follow-up because of how great it was and how versatile the sound was on it but ""gore"" doesn't try to out-do that album and that's a good thing because it's a different type of album. You can definitely hear Chino's Cure influence but there's almost a new sound created for the band at times with their new guitarist that fits the make-up of their composing process. I love Chi and hope he comes out to rejoin the guy but I have to give credit where it's do. ""Gore"" does have a couple headbanging songs but it is also wonderful in how it uses synths and experimentation.

Then In September 1966 Imperial records released a song co-written by Johnny and Lou Adler that would become the biggest hit of his career. The moving ballad ""Poor Side of Town"" would climb to the top of the charts for one week in the fall of 1966. This recording marked a dramatic change in musical styles for Johnny and was one of the most important records of his career. Many would agree that this was the best song he ever recorded.

85400,2664,18597,"The debut album by this darkly epic guitar rock trio from Lviv, Ukraine soars with the confidence and brilliance of a band born to spread the power of rock.  Everything is in perfect sync here; the band plays as though born simultaneously of the same musical womb.  The guitar can be stunningly subtle & understated (as when it rides on echoic dub rhythms with a single-note, bluesy restraint), but mostly it roars with a perfectly controlled Stoner rock rage that seeps into your soul with a  haunted psychedelic glow.  Both the  bass & drums contribute an unusually adept element of musicianship; they know when to hold back and when to explore.  Something like a mix of Glowsun, Hills, Electric Moon, Domadora, Hypnos 69, Hawkwind, Hookworms, Colour Haze, JPT Scare Band.  The Sun is just an incredibly well-played rock album which delivers a psych/space/blues groove thats beyond most of its peers.

85417,4505,18599,"A brand new 40 year old album!

If you're not aware of what this album is, it's studio sessions Elvis recorded at his home in 1976 in the home studio he dubbed ""The Jungle Room"". He was trying out some new things in an attempt to stay ahead of the musical curve rather than trying to make a single cohesive album. So there is a wide variety of sounds here. Not all of the songs were new in 1976, nor were all these songs new to Elvis in 1976, but these are 1976 versions of them. Much of this has been previously released (but not all of it, and some of it in different formats or versions) but this version has been completely remastered so it sounds like you are there in the Jungle Room with him.

Despite it being a wide variety of sounds, its unmistakably all 100% Elvis Presley.

The first 16 tracks are normal studio session songs ready for an album. The rest of the tracks are outtakes and test tracks and such.

 Way Down - This is the last single released by Elvis in 1977. It was released the month before he died. This is an upbeat southern jazzy sound with a lot of energy. There is the full band that Elvis always made great use of, female backup singers adding a gospel type sound that Elvis personally LOVED. And of course, the voice of rock and roll itself on lead vocals.

 She Thinks I Still Care - This is more of Elvis' original style from the 1950s with soft vocals. It's more of a country music band style behind him that his earlier career. But then again this is very famous country song written by Steve Duffy and Dickey Lee and made famous by George Jones. And then everyone else in country music recorded it as well. Elvis makes it his.

 Bitt They Are, Harder They Fall - This is not a gospel song, but it has a similar sound to Elvis' early career gospel music. It was written by Larry Gatlin (Of The Gatlin Brothers) who himself was a gospel singer and songwriter. It's actually a regret song about a relationship falling apart. It's very sad. But somehow when Elvis does it it makes you happy because....Elvis.

 Pledging My Love - This one has a very 1950's rock and roll sound to it. It's a 1954 blues song that's been recorded in a variety of ways by everyone and their mother right up until the modern era. This version is reminiscent of classic early Elvis. It also reminds you how Elvis took over the music industry around that time and made everyone else look simple.

 For The Heart - He does all kinds of stuff here. There is a country sound mixed with an early 1970's synthesizer. (Those didn't work well until the 80's) There is a steel guitar in there. The problem with this track is that Elvis' voice is a lower volume than the band. So the heart of the song is overpowered by an odd mix of music. It's the one I didn't love. The Judds later recorded this as well.

 Love Coming Down - The man could sing the phone book and you'd listen. As soon as Elvis starts on this song you're in love with it. It's Elvis with his gospel style sound (not a gospel song) and full harmonic vocal back ups behind him. I'm not familiar with other versions of this. There may be some, but I don't know them. And quite frankly I'm too lazy to research it.

 He'll Have To Go - This is a Jim Reeves classic. Elvis doesn't change the sound of it much except for the vocals. And of course, when Elvis sings it, it becomes his own. This is a song written in 1959 that Elvis recorded in 1976. The Elvis version has been released before and you've probably heard it 100 times. But it sounds brand new here. This track is a shining example of how good the remastering is on this album.

 Blue Eyes Crying In The Rain - It's widely believes that this was the last song Elvis Aaron Presley ever sang. (Not this recording. But the song itself. It was one of his personal favorites and he sang it at home to friends and family. This was apparently the last song he sung while sitting at home on August 16, 1977. He passed away later that day.) My favorite version of this song is by Willie Nelson. This version sounds absolutely nothing like Willie Nelson's version. And it's still amazing.

 Hurt - This is not the same Hurt that Johnny Cash covered near the end of his life. This is the 1954 song that was a Billboard top hit in multiple categories for Elvis when he covered and released it in 1977. It's a classic example of Elvis' late career from the shows with the sequins and capes and such.

 Never Again - This is a song written by Billy Wheeler, who wrote some classic songs, including ""Jackson"" for Johnny Cash. (Among other things) This song is a slow ballad that sounds amazingly Elvis.

 Danny Boy - Written in 1910 and sung by every human being alive over the last 106 years, this version is the best one. Elvis Presley's rendition of Danny Boy is the gold standard for this song. My wife thinks it's Harry Connick Jr's version. But she's wrong. This it is. Connick's version is great. Elvis' version will make shamrocks grow.

 Solitaire - Neil Sedaka originally wrote and recorded this. The Carpenters made it famous. Elvis makes it awesome. (And I like the Carpenters version) It's a slow ballad and just plays well to Elvis' ability to belt out power notes better than Karen Carpenter could.

 Moody Blue - This is obviously the title track of his Moody Blue album, the final full studio album Elvis released. It's a poppy country sound (1976 style). It never really stood on it's own as a single but the album by the same name soared on the charts after Elvis died within the year. Personally I think this song is underrated. I love it.

 It's Easy For You - Here's a fun fact, this was written by Braodway super producer Andrew Lloyd Webber. (He did some plays you may have heard of like Phantom of the Opera, Cats, Evita....) It's very piano heavy, more than most Elvis song. But again...written by the guy who gave us music form Phantom of the Opera. So there is a theme here.

 I'll Never Fall In Love Again - Originally written by Lonnie Donegan and Jimmy Currie in 1962, this became a hit when Tom Jones redid it in 1967. Elvis did it in 1976. Guess which one was the best version? Go ahead...guess....

 The Last Farewell - Roger Whittaker wrote this song in 1971. Elvis recorded it in 1976. It's a story ballad about sailing a ship into battle. That is a departure from the style you're used to from Elvis. He takes a softer approach to the vocals on this one. Of course it's still awesome because it's his voice.
___________________________________________________

The rest of the tracks include alternate takes of the songs above. What gets included on these is the discussion about the songs before and after each one where Elvis is talking to the band or to the producer or just making jokes. You get a look into Elvis' human side listening to these extras.

These aren't always as cleaned up as the versions on the first 16 tracks. There is some static and background noise at times. But these aren't studio releases. These make you feel like you're just sitting around Elvis' house listening to him jam with his band. It's a completely different look at The King.",1470355200,5
85418,1484,18600,"Man I hate getting my hopes up only to be disappointed. The hype over this album was said that it was supposed to be the best produced album in years by Jackyl. That might be true, but the materiel wasn't worth producing well to begin with.

There is a bunch of filler among a couple of meh songs. Not one single song here sticks out above the rest as the best song on the album. They all are a mediocre at best rating. Nothing here is worthy of being added to the live set or worthy of being added to the listing of Jackyls 'best of'.

Usually I like when Jackyl do cover versions, but even ""Everyone's a winner"" here is a song that is just meh, not a song I liked before and still don't. The only track that seemed to have anything going for it was the final one, but then again, how many times is Jessie Dupree going to try and write the same song? Enough with the ""Rev it up and go"" already. The same can be said for ""Just because i'm drunk""... it's just a watered down version of ""Secret of the bottle"".

I don't get why some have already said ""Rally"" is a favorite of theirs? The song sounds silly with lyrics ""Rally, Rally, Rally, Uga, Chugga, Ugga Chugga""... really? Was this inspired by wanting to see a rally car being driven by that 20 year old dancing baby animation thing? Not to mention the chorus seems to be something they slapped over another song and it sounds out of place together.

This album has failed to rock me, roll me or jackly me off in any way. Sure, the production is good, but you know what they say about something in particular that you can polish. The attempt at a deeper sound of metal too doesn't seem right for Jackyl. It sounds more like them trying anything to keep current, and thats not why fans stick with them.

I haven't given up hope, and think Jackyl can still bounce back, but they sure are not the same band they once where. They really need to find themselves again and work out what made their first couple of albums great. Nothing here is worthy of being noteworthy of a Jackyl classic.",1470355200,2

85427,56,18601,"When it has came down to movie songs lately, they have seemed to run out of the magic. Unfortunately, I believe that is why everyone lately has been trying to do cover songs instead, which are more wasted because the chemistry the original artist that did record the song made you really bliss into ecstasy. That lag came from covers recently from Sia with her rendition of Natalie Cole's Unforgettable which was lagging the chemistry she and her great father showed in spirit and song, and with the Ghostbusters theme song which Fall Out Boy didn't make you feel afraid, just laugh around compared to the song back in 1984. Now, Panic! At The Disco is doing another cover for the films. Their rendition of Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody actually fairs better than the other two joke covers, that really didn't thrive from the original song. Still, Panic! At The Disco is no Freddie Mercury's in disguise, but at least they can strike a bit better. Still, if you are a die hard Queen fan, you'll definitely want to stick to the original, or if area die hard Panic! At The Disco fan, than you'll want the song.

85442,9723,18606,"""Forever!"" is another dope album in Hed P.E.'s catalogue. If you are a fan, you will not be disappointed. ""Pay Me"" is my personal favorite, but I also really dig ""It's You"" and ""One of a Kind"". ""Closer"" and ""Jah Know"" also slay. ""Shadowridge"" has an amazing chorus, but unfortunately, they only play it once during the song. There are no bad songs on this record. Every tune is bad ass. The reggae tunes are super dope as well. Jahred is at the top of his game. I was definitely disappointed when I found out Jaxon and Mauk were no longer in the band, but the new dudes (Gregzilla on guitar and Kurt B. on bass) kick ass on the record, and live as well. Trauma is always killing it on the drums too. My favorite Hed P.E. record is still ""Evolution"", but ""Forever!"" earns its place in the pantheon of Hed PE records. I just hope Jahred plays more of these songs live (not just ""Pay Me"", which is awesome). Heck, I'm still waiting for the band to play ""No Tomorrow"" and ""Lost in Babylon"" off the last record. Jahred, if you're reading this, you need to radically switch up the setlist my brother. You guys kill it live, but it's been the same songs for the past four years or so. I know because I go to your shows all the time! Bring back ""Live and Die Free"", ""Madhouse"", and ""Sophia"", and then play nothing but new tracks. Anyhow, I highly recommend Hed P.E.'s ""Forever!"". Buy it NOW!!!",1470355200,5

85447,2635,18472,"I love how many if these metalcore bands are making changes in their sound to satisfy a more diverse range of people. I can understand why the fans may not like it, but as someone who never really cared for Crown The Empire up until this album here, it's a fantastic thing. This is an album that opts to be much more explorative and forward thinking than their other discs, and shows many different sides of this band. If you want to give something a chance, pick this up. Music doesn't always have to have breakdowns in it to be enjoyed. Music has to have an overall good feel to it, which this album does, with songs such as ""Oxygen"", ""Kaleidoscope"", and Target bonus track ""Mercury"" showcasing that and more.

85448,4804,18533,"These guys are so talented, the guitar player and composer is top shelf, his guitar solos are awesome.  The orchestration of the guitar, sax/trumpet/violin is excellent.  Just like their first CD and EP, it does take multiple listens for all the pieces to fall into place and for the hooks to be stuck in your ears, but it is well worth the effort.  Listen to the whole thing at least three times and then make a decision.",1470355200,5

85450,5706,18607,"I'm a fan of soundtracks that bring together current artists and/or have innovative collaborations; even when the movie, itself, might suck. I haven't seen this movie but the reviews are mixed, leaning in the negative. I see this soundtrack as the same. I'm a big fan of Dan Auerbach, I have respect for Mark Ronson and really like a few of his songs, the same with Skrillex. The artists I haven't heard before (like Grace, Kehlani and Twenty One Pilots) for me, have the strongest contributions.

If there are only one or two songs on here you know you want, I would buy them individually. If you think there *might* be more, I would recommend waiting until this album drops to like $5 (which should be soon). Getting the 3-5 good songs for $5 would be a good deal. If you're a fan of Skrillex, Panic at the Disco, twenty one pilots maybe get those as standalone purchases. Black Keys fans, I would move along. Nothing to see here.

I would not recommend buying this album at full-price if you think it might happen to be a killer soundtrack and you want to ""try it out"" (like I did).",1470355200,3

85454,2571,16335,Red Steagall is a very under rated performer who never had a top ten song.  Lone Star Beer And Bob Wills Music made it to number 11.  And he is probably best remembered for discovering Reba McEntire.  Anyway this is a good two cd set that has just about all the songs that I remember by him.  Including Fiddle Man which is another great song that came and went pretty quickly and was all but just about forgotten about.  There are songs on here like I Gave Up Good Mornin' Darling which Mel McDaniel covered later as Hello Daddy Good Mornin' Darling.  The only complaint I have is that Freckles Brown should be on here.,1470355200,4

85476,1348,4118,"""Well, that was really self-indulgent.""

The above quote was heard spewing from the mouth of a fellow concert-goer last fall, after having witnessed a stunning opening set from The Antlers, which understandably flew over the heads of 90% of the crowd who wedged themselves into the sold-out theater to take in the headliners of the evening, Death Cab For Cutie. Much like the moody and ambient set provided by the band that evening, ""Familiars"" is certainly an acquired taste. The fifth offering from the indie underdogs is perhaps the band's most cohesive and compelling offering. Swirling horns and spacey guitar noodling highlight a slow-burning affair that challenges its listeners to just shut up and listen to the music. Truly, this is the sort of album you're meant to appreciate on a late evening, with a little melancholy and regret stewing in your belly (preferably with a few drinks thrown in the mix). In an era where artists and the audience alike seem to be tossing the idea of the album as a work of art out the window, ""Familiars"" keeps its feet firmly in place, compelling you take in all 54 minutes of glorious, gut-wrenching and oft-heart-breaking hymns, dirges and odes to heart-break and letting go of the past. It's hard to reach the end of this one and not get hung up on The Antlers for good.",1470355200,5

85481,2635,18602,"Well, it didn't end up topping ""Comatose"" (nothing ever will), but ""Unleashed"" is still a fantastic album and a true turnaround for the group after the disappointing ""Rise"". This album is proof that Skillet has the capability of caring diverse sounds without sounding disingenuous, while this is still primarily a rock album. From ""Feel Invincible"" and ""Back From The Dead"", which are enjoyable rock songs, to ""Lions"" which is a very passionate worship song, to the adventurous and atmospheric ""Saviors Of The World"", this is a band that basically any music fan can listen to and not feel ashamed that they are moving away from their preferred genre. Definitely a recommendable purchase for Active Rock fans, and also for fans of other genres as well.

One day I was sitting and wishing Coldplay would ""sound like they used to"" and then I realized that I actually don't want that - I just got used to hearing their old sound.  But their Viva la Vida album blew my mind once I stepped out of my preconceptions.  What it comes down to is songwriting - whether you use a guitar, a kazoo, or a synth - a good song is a good song.  A good hook is a good hook.  On this album, Needtobreathe went with a funk sound, and they do it very well.  It's clean (actually much cleaner than some of their recent stuff that just sounded a big cacophonous).  I appreciate the haunting auto-tuned opening song, and I think the horns on Money & Fame take the song to a new level.  There are some beautiful ballads, and they obviously didn't throw on every song they wrote, ending up with a shorter but tighter album.  I think this is their best since The Outsiders, which blew my mind as well.  I'll be spinning this one for a while.",1470441600,5

85563,3512,18617,"This Charleston-bred, Nashville-resident band continues to be the foremost exponent of the Beach Boys sound. But not the surf-and-drag singles-sound of the Beach Boys c. 63-64, but rather the album sounds of Brian Wilsons growing compositional depth of 65-onward. Add dashes of Burt Bacharach, Curt Boettcher and Paul Williams, and you have a sense of the groups sophistication. Few have so thoroughly imbibed the sunshine that flowed through Brian Wilson in the mid-to-late-60s as Explorers Club vocalist, songwriter and arranger Jason Brewer. When he sings 'Californias Callin Ya', you can hear Wilsons imagery calling the South Carolinian like a sea siren. The harmonies are lush and warm, the arrangements multifaceted, the album cover an homage to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Friends/dp/B00005ABWY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Friends</a>, and the indie record label - Goldstar - a direct allusion to the craft Brian Wilson laid into everything he produced. The spot-on evocation of late-60s Beach Boys might appeal as a parlor trick if it weren't so beautifully crafted and so incredibly heartfelt.

85578,7516,17846,"Switchfoot gets better and better.  I thought it would be hard to match the quality of Vice Verses (I wasn't so thrilled about Fading West), but this matches it without a doubt.  It swings, punches, and soars melodically and rhythmically.  The intensity of Holy Water eases into the funk (and sweet alternating time signature) of Float, which eases into the mid-tempo Where the Light Shines Through.  I NEVER say this about an album, but there are literally no weak or ""skippable"" tracks.  If the House Burns Down Tonight is a very mature track, going beyond a love song and taking on a realistic view of a raw relationship that lasts.  It's also got a killer chorus (as Dave Grohl jokes, don't bore us get to the chorus!)  Bull in a China Shop is addictive and layered perfectly, the staccato monotone lyric laid on top of some tasty guitar riffs that take a while for the ear to pick up on.  I really appreciative Foreman's songwriting - he is obviously meticulous, and can nail both the hard stuff and the sweet stuff without over-reaching.

One criticism:  The ""bonus"" tracks are pretty weak.  I wish I had just gotten the regular album instead of the deluxe, because the bonus tracks, although maybe fun to record, aren't nearly as strong as the rest of the album.  I love putting a great album on from start to finish, and when it finishes I want it to finish strong.  Hope is the Anthem is a beautiful, poignant, rising ballad that doesn't need anything to follow it.",1470441600,5

This record is full of all kinds of emotions. Humor, forgiveness, youthful pride and many other subjects. Great songwriting all the way around.
Of course, the playing and singing are both great. The production is pristine in an era of recordings often sounding dull.

85626,5355,18626,"I flipped over the last album by the North Carolina-based quintet  The Honeycutters  a year or so ago and couldn't wait to see where they would take their music next. Well, they didn't disappoint with this 59-minute 13-track CD. From the first moments of the lead-off track On The Ropes youll find yourself hooked  and the music won't let you go as they move through the 12 songs penned by lead vocalist (and guitar player) Amanda Anne Platt. (More about the one cover song in a minute). The blend of mandolin and pedal steel are outstanding. When the fourth track The Handbook comes on, youll be tempted to grab a partner and Texas-swing dance!

As I said there is one track here that Platt didn't write. Its a cover of Leonard Cohens Hallelujah. Ive become so tired of hearing, not only Tim Buckleys hit version but the many other cover versions, that I always turn it off or hit the fast-forward button. But not this time. The band here has pumped up the speed to a faster pace (with a driving snare drum backing and a nice pedal steel guitar solo, that  even at eight minutes (!)  the song takes on a new happy mood.  Not everything here is upbeat; there are a few ballads ( Useless Memories for example).

The packaging is well-thought-out as well. The CD comes in a tri-fold digipak with two photos of the full band (though you cant identify each member  except Platt, the sole female  because none are holding instruments. Inside you will find the lyrics to all the songs, except Hallelujah . You might need a magnifying glass  but at least you don't need to log on to their website to read them.

This is not  a bluegrass band (though they have a mandolin), and its not country (despite the pedal steel). Its between folk and Americana and just darn great music! Check out the samples and see if the title track doesnt grab you as it did me.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

85640,56,6783,"It is honestly so sad whenever someone young and talented leaves this Earth so soon, and yet you really forget about the joy and beauty that person has left behind in their music. That has been the case with Whitney Houston. Hard to believe that it has been over for years since she passed away, and I am often reminded just the real beauty of her voice, compared to so many female jokes of today like Ariana Grande and Beyonce' Knowles that have much less than what she brought to the table. That has shown with each and every song Whitney Houston performed and covered. Especially with The Bodyguard soundtrack. Her cover of Chaka Khan's I'm Every Woman is a very upbeat and delightful song that still moves me each and every time I hear the song. She definitely drove her soul on the rhythm with each and every note, and made it her own for a generation that still knows music today. If you have never heard a Whitney Houston song before, well this is one cover that I sincerely recommend from beginning to end. Too bad female artists will never ignite the way ""The Voice"" reigned.

85662,12631,5827,"The ""blue-eyed soul"" vocal duo known as The Righteous Brothers had experienced some moderate chart success in the early 1960's when they caught the eye of Phil Spector. He signed Bill Medley and Bobby Hatfield to his Philles label in the autumn of 1964 and immediately set about to create a new and distinctive sound for the boys. Their debut single on Philles was ""You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin"" and it shot right to the top of the Billboard Hot 100 Singles chart in early 1965. Over the next year Spector would produce three more Top Ten hits for The Righteous Brothers before the duo decided to leave Philles and signed a new record deal with Verve. That may have been a mistake because Phil Spector obviously knew what he was doing and despite a #1 song ""(You're My) Soul and Inspiration"" The Righteous Brothers were never able to attain the same level of success at their new record label that they had at Philles. ""Lovin Feelin"" has been recognized by both the Grammy Hall of Fame and the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame as one of the most important songs in the history of rock & roll.  One of the greatest singles of the decade.",1470528000,5

85674,12631,12322,"The release of ""There Goes My Baby"" in May 1959 marks yet another seminal moment in the long history of this venerable R&B vocal group. Just months earlier the group's manager George Treadwell had disbanded the existing Drifters group and brought in The Five Crowns and renamed that group The Drifters. These ""new"" Drifters were led by a dynamic young lead vocalist named Ben E King and included Charlie Thomas who continues to perform Drifters tunes to this day. The move proved to be a stroke of genius as over the next 5 years The Drifters would prove to be a wildly successful recording act. ""There Goes My Baby"" would spend 19 weeks on the charts peaking at #2 in the summer of 1959. Produced by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, it was one of the first R&B records ever to use strings.",1470614400,4

85737,3897,17281,"""Chakra Noir"", the newest album by iconic German instrumentalist, sitarist and composer Al Gromer Khan is out since April 2016 on his Rasa Music label. Again packaged in rather simple, but elegant 4-panel digipak. After deep sonic meditations on ""Day Of The Beloved"", released at the beginning of 2016, the Maestro shifts his filigree soundsculpting into mesmerizingly illuminating and exceptionally textured transcultural sonic paradise. Enter these nectarous realms now!!!

5-minute ""A Simple World With Flowers"" reveals with ethereal chants of, I believe Al's wife Ute, supported by laid-back percussive downtempos, serpentine drones and sitar piquancy. A truly ear-tickling potpourri awaits here, which gorgeously interacts with its title. The next composition, ""Degrees Of Tenderness"", embodies placid, balmily enveloping jazzy influenced patterns with pellucid strings of sitar. Chirping subtleties along with intangible glimpses of bells paint contemplative images, then clandestinely metamorphosing into calmly evanescing monochromatic drone horizons. ""Shedding Light"" shifts into subtly enigmatic expanses, soothingly nuanced and guarded by elusive choirs, and reinforced by stringed poetic lyricism. The title track, ""Chakra Noir"", clocks to 5 and a half minutes, actually most of the compositions are hanging around 5 minutes in length. Mysterious zones are permeated by Ute's voice fragments, glistening rumbles, sitar curlicues, titillating chimes and ephemeral choirs. Pristine, crystalline, minimal, yet richly scented. ""A Summer Tale"" delves into more drifting sceneries counterpointed with translucently tantalizing sitar. Celestial choir-like washes and leisure, jazz-driven tempos sneak in as well. ""Adya Shakti"", with 3 minutes the shortest piece on ""Chakra Noir"", immediately attracts with gorgeously poignant acoustic guitar, meticulously embraced by gossamery halcyon zones and pervaded by expressive sitar transiency. Encircling beauty!!! ""Tan & Maroon"" keeps on evocative path, melting variety of strings like acoustic guitar, sitar, cello or viola..., ranging from enchantingly warm to sinuously weeping, with hypnotically sculpted percussive beats, temporary bell diaphanousness and glancing piano solitudes. Another sonic splendor!!! ""Im Nu"" blends masterfully assortment of heavenly choirs and voice fragments with intricately helixing undulations and mellowly insistent melodic patterns. Exquisitely ambrosial composition!!! ""The Train And The Crow"" returns to flamboyantly colored terrains, where thrillingly crafted and distinctively fragranced instrumentation, perfectly evoking an adventurous railway journey, cleverly melts with western-influenced ambient soundscaping. An utterly gorgeous piece, where South Asian perfumes spectacularly bridge with the Wild West magic of abandoned ghost towns. Wow, this was a truly unexpected sonic exploration!!! ""Rose Of All My Days"", as displayed by its title, remains in calmer, poetic territories, where occasional spicy sitar tapestries coalesce with captivatingly immersing laid-backness and airy cinematic blankets. Eloquent violin announces ""The King's Companion"", gentle strings emerge as well along with piano glimpses. Scenic passages inconspicuously awake too and commingle with beautifully tearful bowed strings, sensuous sitar embellishments and rattling traceries. Transmuting, cascading, meandering, drifting... ""Into Blue"", with 6:38 the longest piece on the album, closes this strikingly magnificent ride with euphorically colored texture, which moves surreptitiously through different twists and nuances, always fascinatingly perfumed with sitar, tabla or harmonica passages, and sporadic whispers, no matter if exotic or again with strikingly distinguishing infusion of the Southwestern heat haze. A virtuoso conclusion!!!

61-minute ""Chakra Noir"" is utterly extraordinary recording by Al Gromer Khan, showcasing on one side his traditional insignias with long lasting perfumes, but this time stirringly amalgamated with strikingly unique and blazingly imaginative arrangements shifting this album into a brand new level, where electro-acoustic brilliance melts with awe-inspiring invention. I believe this is another huge achievement in Al Gromer Khan's stellar musical career that spans five decades. A truly special listening adventure awaits when exploring ""Chakra Noir"", don't miss it!!!

85740,7395,18,"It seems like the record companies who track what gets released to radio have the stupidest brains when it comes to choosing singles.

I know Brantley Gilbert penned this song because of the tragic death of a soldier, and that makes a song worth serious attention, but there are tons of other country songs out there regarding fallen soldiers or soldiers in general out there and much more emotional and heart-felt than this song. I don't mind Brantley Gilbert making a song about the undeserved death of a soldier, since most of his material released as singles is either mediocre or absolutely horrible (I give 'Bottoms Up' credit for at least being catchy even though there are things about it that I don't like), but trying to express the emotion of th death of a loved one in a song, and then using the most trite, horrid, and annoying high-pitched guitar solos all over the song make the person the song is about ashamed. In fact, this is worse than what Gilbert has put out with any of his other singles. At least songs like 'Read Me My Rights' & 'Stone Cold Sober' show that Gilbert is making music correctly even though the instrumental elements of the songs may not be done well.

But, when Radio Stations fumble with what gets played on the radio, and then choose a very annoying and terrible song to play, thats what should be abolished for eternity.  Even worse is when they play a bad song ad nauseum, you predict they probably won't play a song that much to elavate your anger, but they do anyway, no matter how you feel about the song, and it never stops until you start hating the song with a passion, and THEN they start to cool down with that song. Instead of just stopping with the song right when you feel like they need to stop. That is a method in radio, not just country, that needs to be abolished from reality for eternity.

We need a Brantley Gilbert song that isn't so boring, bland, trite, or not what you want to repeat on Spotify. His new single isn't helping because besides the country pop and rock stuff that you saw in 'Bottoms Up', Gilbert ends up using some of the worst cliches and overused phrases. Instead of thinking to yourself 'Finally, a song from this guy I can actually tolerate beyond chart movement', its always the same feelings about a whole new song all over again.

So overall, listen to Toby Keiths 'Ameican Soldier' instead of this stupid Def Leppard, Guns N Roses country garbage with lyrics.",1470614400,1

85766,4505,6491,"I don't think I've ever sat down and listened to Kevin Hart do stand up before. I've seen him on TV and in movies a hundred times and I've always thought he was funny the way he plays up how he's a short guy. But I've never listened to his stand up act.

When I did listen to his stand up act on this album I thought it was really funny, but it lacked something by being audio only. You could tell Kevin Hart sells a lot of the joke with body language and facial expressions. He does that on TV and in movies too. And you can tell he's doing physical stuff on this album because he says things like ""he made this face..."" then there is a pause. So without the video this lacks something. I haven't seen the video of this, but I'm pretty sure the video would make it significantly funnier.

That being said, his material is hysterical. He goes into a lot about daily life as a parent and about being a dad. As a dad, he's spot on! He tells it like is in an insanely funny way. When he gets into how dads watch kids....hilarious!

When he gets to the part about his ex convict uncle coming home from prison and having trouble reintegrating back into society.....oh my god...I couldn't breath at times. It is absolutely hysterical.

Ultimately this is well worth checking out. But if you have the ability to watch it instead of listening to it, you should watch it instead. Hart's facial expressions and body language add to his comedy.",1470700800,4

85822,4505,10578,"Amy Schumer's act is completely shock value. There is no getting around that. But she delivers it perfectly so it's hilarious. Her timing is perfect. The way she delivers the hidden punch line softly after the louder set up without pause is just perfect.

It's also REALLY dirty. So if you're an easily offended precious snowflake you might want to skip Amy Schumer. If you have no sense of humor you will not enjoy this at all. Her entire act is built around sex jokes, hardships of being a woman jokes, hating other women jokes, religious jokes, and ethnicity jokes. So pretty much every hot button topic that's liable to make easily offended people angry.

As for this album, one of the best things about it is that it doesn't need the video to make it funny. Some stand ups using facial expressions and body language has huge parts of their act, so the audio only version doesn't work as well. Amy Schumer's act works fine in an audio only version. The only exception is the very last joke on the album. She does something the audience can see that they apparently find hysterical, but the joke is completely lost with this audio only version. That's the only instance though.

When she does her bit about how she's Jewish and a Christian tries to tell her about Jesus.......let me just say it's one of the funniest things I've ever heard in a stand up act. I don't want to spoil the punch line but it's in track 7. If you listen to nothing else....check that track out. It happens near the end of the track. Keep listening into track 8 as the bit continues.",1470700800,5

85885,15767,18666,"I bought this a few months before I saw the show on Broadway.  It's Disney, doing what Disney does best. I especially liked some of the songs written specifically for the musical, ""Proud of Your Boy"" (sob my heart out!), Babkak, Omar, Alladin, Kassim (nothing could prepare me for the stage choreography that goes with this song), Diamond in the Rough (my Jafar is witty!), High Adventure (listen to it a few times because it's funny!). Many of the songs have ""dance breaks"" that weren't in the movie, but make sense for the stage.

I won't spoil how they managed to do the Genie without Robin Williams or animation, but rest assured he's still a great character. Friend Like Me and Prince Ali were modified accordingly and they're just as fun as the movie versions. Listen for the Disney classics homage in Friend Like Me.

I felt the weak songs were A Million Miles Away (Whole New World all over again) and Somebody's Got Your Back.

Finally, don't miss the extra tracks with Alladin & Genie at the piano with composer Alan Menken.  Even if you don't get a chance to see it on Broadway, I'd consider this a must-add for any Broadway lover's collection.",1470700800,5

85947,18,17675,"James Blake is been one of the more interesting electronic/dubstep artists in the last 6-7 years, and I've been a fan from the early goings-on. I loved his 2011 accomplished debut album, only to be astonished by his frankly perfect 2013 ""Overgrown"" album, which I had in my top albums of the year, period. Now, after an incredible long lay-off (in particular considering his profuse output in his early years), 3 years later we finally get his third studio album.

""The Colour In Anything"" (17 tracks; 76 min.) is released as a single CD but of course at this running time it is a double vinyl album. It starts off with Blake's haunting vocals on the opening track ""Radio Silence"" (3rd UK single), where he croons ""I can't believe this, you don't wanna see me"", over and over again. The next memorable song is track 4, ""Timeless"" (2nd UK single), an immediate Blake classic in my book, with spare instrumentation but underlying pulse that is just great. Next great tune is track 6, ""Put That Away and Talk to Me"", my favorite track on the album, a dreamy, yet pulsing tune with lots of scratching sounds underneath that brings out the best in Blake, I simply can't stop playing this song, as Blake wonders in his most quivering voice ""Where is my beautiful life?"". Where indeed, whilst living the life of successful artist... It is followed by the worst track of the album, ""I Hope My Life (1-800 Remix)"", a cheesy upbeat track. In the second half of the album (LP 2), there are way, way too many 'introspective' tracks that just meander and don't go anywhere, and it makes me wonder, where was the producer to reign in the sprawl? Except that for the most part, Blake served as his own producer There are just a couple of more true highlights, ""Noise Above Our Heads"", and the 6 min. epic ""Two Men Down"". Two of the albums tracks were co-written with Justin Vernon, yes, he of Bon Iver, not that you would notice anything different in the sound or structure of those songs. Bottom line: there are a number of great tracks on here, but this album is way, way too long (roughly as long as the first two albums combined), and could've been so much better if half of the (less compelling) songs were left off (and perhaps used as B-sides or other one-offs). If we distill this sprawling album to its essential 45 min., we're talking 4 or 4.5 stars. But as it stands, ""The Colour In Anything"" is a 3 star album, as it pales compared to ""James Blake"" (4 stars) and ""Overgrown"" (4.5 stars). I realize that this is not in line with the majority of reviews here, but this is how I feel about it.

As a huge James Blake fan, I finally had the good fortune of seeing him in concert at the 9:30 Club in Washington, DC in May, 2013, in support of the ""Overgrown"" album. What a fantastic evening of music that was, including a mind-blowing ""Limit To Your Love"" and ""Voyeur"" as absolute highlights. Despite my lukewarm reception of ""The Colour In Anything"",  I'll go see James Blake again in concert in a heartbeat, given the opportunity. If you are new to James Blake, Id recommend you check out either his debut album or the Overgrown album before this one.",1470700800,3

Kochi the latest CD release by the San Diego Jewish Mens Choir directed by Ruth Weber is inspired by Kochi which is hidden in the southwest corner of India, in the state of Kerala, which is considered to be one of the most fascinating Jewish communities. The San Diego Jewish Mens Choir is world class presenting one of the finest vocal ensembles I have ever heard.

86010,15761,3137,"Although im in my 30's, i grew up different genres and forms of jazz. Brazilian jazz and Samba are great and floes through today. Sergio Mendes transcends genres. But i loved this rendition and album as a whole. Play this song when you're having a sunny, relazed day with tea",1470700800,5
86011,15774,2683,"I'm not going to spend time reviewing the songs on this collection.  If you are interested in a B-sides collection you are obviously a fan. Having said that this collection as a whole is less compelling than Alternative,  their first career B-side collection.

What I would like to note for those who would not notice is that this is not a complete collection of B-sides and extras for this time frame.  Songs are inexcusably missing from the collection.

Including ""And Bonus Tracks"" in the title would indicate this collection was more than B-sides but B-sides are only on the collection.  No other tracks such as ""Sail Away"" from the Noel Coward tribute album, ""Break 4 Love"" the non-album single and ""Je t'aime ... moi non plus"" are missing from this time period. Especially glaring is the erotically quirky but amazing ""Je t'aime"" which is strictly a B-side.

I think they could have added these and trimmed off the ""Yes"" album B-sides saving them for the next collection. But why set a precedent.  After all, the first collection left off ""It Doesn't Often Snow At Christmas"".",1470700800,4
86012,5968,11876,"your are really into the classics with this one, and it does follow the format of multiple music selection on each track. I have been a fan of Hooked on when they first came out on tape. You'll love this one",1470700800,5

These are breezy pop tunes with a wide open, ringing flow guiding the addictively welcoming guitar lines.  The songs have an endearing quality of spaciousness integrated with tender singer/songwriter hooks and quietly sweeping arrangements.  Also includes members from Cracker, Gamma, Latin Playboys, Smash Mouth, Third Eye Blind, Candy Butchers, more.  Recalls artists like Jon Lindsay, Nada Surf and, uhhh, James Taylor.

Reminiscent of Morning Runner and Tokyo Police Club (Elephant Shell & Champ) and other post punk rock from the UK - Ballsy Brit Rock. Great production and testosterone loaded performance.

This CD shows clearly that he's really grown as an artist and a songwriter and I'm sure has yet to release many more awesome albums. The standout song on this CD (as well as my favorite) is ""Ghost Town"". Give this CD a listen. It's awesome.

I pulled into the Amore Grill and ordered a BLT. It was pretty tasty. Anyways I got to talking to the waitress and she was telling me about this band called Bloody Hammers. She apparently knows them and said they were good. Now anybody that knows me knows that a name like Bloody Hammers caused my beard hairs to curl in interest. She said they were a husband and wife goth group. I grew up on some Sisters of Mercy, Bauhaus, The Damned, Type O Negative, and some later on Tiamat. Well as soon as I got back I looked these couple up and found this here album. Gave it a listen on YouTube and I admit I was smitten with the music. I proceeded to buy this fun little album. Great hooks. Great riffs. If you love the Goth/Doom genre you shall enjoy this. So to that waitress there in Transylvania County I say ""Mucho Grassyass"".",1470787200,5

86119,2664,18684,"4th album from North Carolina band who deliver darkly soaring neo-Goth mystic metal rock of the Old Gods; songs to lift the spirit and crush the soul in the orgasmic beauty of indulgent drama through the demon-blessed vibrations of guitar, synthesizers and baritone shiver-vocals.  This is music with an inspiringly huge, unabashedly over-the-top old-school Goth rock splendor and heavy metal power.  The bands warm, inviting production style and their ability to mix melodic accessibility with a menacing rumble of supernal metallic strength gives the album an unusually resonate appeal.  It references a number of potent bands:  Sisters Of Mercy, King Dude, Type O Negative, Beastmaker, Grave Babies, March Violets, Fields of the Nephilim, New Zero God, Uncle Acid.  Lovely Sort Of Death encapsulates all that was, and is, good about the heavy and transformative spirit of Gothic rock.  Recommended.",1470787200,5

86138,12631,18688,"Like so many other recording artists who emerged in the 1960's Glen Campbell's rise to fame and fortune was meteoric and quite unlikely. It is fair to say that Glen had been around the block a few times when in 1968 he was sort of ""discovered"" by The Smothers Brothers who were searching for a summer replacement for their highly successful CBS-TV variety show. The nation fell in love with Glen and recognized him for the huge talent that he was. Much to everyone's surprise the summer fill-in show was a huge hit. ""The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour"" would return in January 1969 and Glen Campbell became a household name. But it wasn't always that way.

In the fall of 1961, Glen Campbell released the original version of ""Turn Around, Look at Me"" on the tiny Crest label. The tune was a local hit and made a small dent on the national charts. In the ensuing few years he would manage a couple of more minor hits and did some session work with The Hondells and The Beach Boys. Then in 1967 he hooked up with songwriter John Hartford and recorded ""Gentle On My Mind"". Now people were beginning to pay attention. The success of the television show would pave the way for Glen Campbell to become a full-fledged star. In October 1967 Capitol released the follow-up single to ""Gentle On My Mind"". ""By The Time I Get To Phoenix"" was a moving country ballad written by Jimmy Webb. The song proved to be a modest hit on the pop charts but climbed all the way to #2 on Billboard's Hot Country Singles chart. In addition, the song garnered a pair of awards at the 10th Annual Grammys including ""Pop Male Vocal"" of the year. Looking over is extensive body of work ""By The Time I Get To Phoenix"" is clearly one the best songs Glen Campbell ever recorded.  This is the original Capitol hit recording.",1470787200,5

86180,18,18126,"When Mumford & Sons released their third album ""Wilder Mind"" last year, one could practically hear a collective gasp in the Mumford & Sons fandom, if not the music industry. The band pretty much abandoned its tried-and-true sound from the first 2 albums and went, gulp, electric! I am all for bands evolving and trying new things, as long as it works. Alas, for me, ""Wilder Mind"" was a letdown and a noble failure. I was not surprised at all when I heard that not long after the release of ""Wilder Mind"", the band went back in the studio for more work, this time cooperating with famed South African musicians Baaba Maal, Beatenberg, and the Very Best. Now we finally get the fruits of that collaboration.

""Johannesburg"" (5 tracks; 21 min.) is half an album of songs, and we start off with a very surprising soft piano sound on ""There Will Be Time"", and eventually Baaba Maal joins on vocals. The song builds towards a dramatic climax, but the surprise for me is that it doesn't sound all that ""South African"". This is in contrast with the next track, ""Wona"", which features the classic rhythm and beats that we associate with South Africa, ever since Paul Simon's ""Graceland"" album opened the world eyes and ears (is it a coincidence that ""Graceland"" was released exactly 30 years ago this year?). ""Fool You've Landed"" continues the good vibes. ""Ngamila"" is a nice combination of traditional Mumford and classic South African sounds. But the best is saved for last: the EP's closing (and longest) track is ""Si Tu Veux"", where we get treated to what feels like a song from a South African play of some sort. Hard to put into words, but believe me, it sounds wonderful.

I knew the EP was out, but hadn't bothered with it. Then a couple of weeks ago, I briefly listened to it at a listening station at my local independent record store here in Cincinnati (what would I do without Shake It?), and was intrigued enough, so I bought it. I must say, I've been playing this a lot more than I expected, and for me this marks a nice recovery from the letdown that was ""Wilder Mind"". I wish there were more than just 5 songs on here. That aside, ""Johannesburg"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1470787200,4

86195,1143,18693,"HUGE Oils fan here in the States since 1982...happy I saw them in NYC in 1997, killer live band too, espesh Rob Hirst...when I heard about Peter's new solo record, I was quite excited and had no idea what to expect...the only thing that mattered was that it was good and true to his ideals.  Got it in the mail earlier this week, and the packaging was a nice thin cardboard slipcase, and I like the artwork, the use of colours white, grey, black & pink.  Only 9 songs and 35 minutes, but man, what a punch!!  It's Peter with his musical friends, including one Oil, and his 3 daughters...who must be either in their teens or early 20s, and it sounds like a livewire band, not a studio recording.  The songs are catchy and ALIVE, immediate.  Sounds Oils-ish, but more personal, and these songs can work live with the Oils on their upcoming tour.  Kinda like how Tom Petty did his ""Full Moon Fever"" as a solo record with Heartbreaker Mike Campbell, with the songs just as immediate and catchy and bandlike, and played live on tour with the Heartbreakers.  This record is all killer & no filler, has a 60s garagepunk feel and the songs can easily work on the radio.  Little Steven would add songs from this to his Underground Garage channel easily on SiriusXM when he hears them, and one may even get the award for ""Coolest Song Of The Week""!!  Would not be surprised.  I don't think Peter dumped politics per se, as it is one of his passions, BUT I am happy he didn't dump music either.  Writing his memoir, these songs trickled out.  Now I want to read his book as well...would be an interesting tome.  Welcome back Peter, music missed ya mate.",1470787200,5

86200,2402,18694,"Amys second and final album release in 2006 signalled her moving on from the jazzy debut Frank and embracing a more R&B style to appeal to a wider mainstream audience. The resulting overall sound resembles the Motown/soul era of the 1960s and 70s with brass, strings and backing vocals later added to the basic rhythm section by producers Ronson & Remi. The album was a deserved Grammy winner and remains Amys defining work, containing five songs destined to become hit singles.

In addition to the 11 songs on the 2006 album, the 2007 deluxe edition includes a bonus disc of extra tracks and performances in front of a live-audience.

Whats special about B to B? The overall sound is intentionally retro, but Winehouses edgy, often explicit lyrics are delivered with artistry, a brash, sassy urban confidence and rare mastery of her chosen style. She broke new ground in popular music which opened the door to a host of style-imitators: Adele, La Roux, Little Boots and a host of others. But B to B is the original style-defining musical statement, and will always be a classic.

RIP Amy.",1470787200,5

I couldn't find a physical release of this available anywhere, so I had to digitally download it. Anyway, after many years, the band has returned to form with their original melodic rock style that they've always excelled at, but they incorporate some other sounds of influence from bands such as The Police and Yes. The Outfield's original drummer, Alan Jackman, returned to record this project, resulting in the band's best record since their sophomore release. Tony Lewis' lead vocals seem much stronger on this effort than they have since Bangin', and guitarist John Spinks once again delivers great guitar melodies and vocal harmonies. Fans of The Outfield or 80's rock in general should check out this release. My favorites would have to be ""California Sun"", ""Shake Your Thing"", ""New York City"" and ""Process"".",1470787200,5

Up (You Turn Me) and In An Instant are so catchy.  ""You"" is such a thick eerie piano piece with vocals.  Stand Tall is also nicely catchy.  The other 5 tracks I find bland.

The collaboration of various talented musicians brought the Project Vol. 1 much success globally and the producers now bring this lovely sequel album. "" Jesus Reigns"" feat. Eric Lige and Tinika Wyatt is full of energy and got the blood pumping :-) Great vocals! ""Siyahamba"" with its wonderful mix of languages and lovely children chorus. This track is full of life :-) Eric Lige and Lucia Davidson have performed a lovely song with ""Favor"". The powerful vocals are full of verve and conviction :-) ""We Stand In Awe"" is an uplifting track sung beautifully by Eric Lige and Andy Delos Santos. A very very nice song! ""Tu Amor"" is yet another standout song with great rhythm and guitar and melodious vocals. ""Look To The Lord"" is a beguiling song...the effortless segueing of Japanese and English is brilliant! Similarly, the fantastic merging of Chinese and English with "" Holy Spirit is magical . I loved the Vietnamese and Spanish songs too!

""Wherever is Your Heart"",, ""The Eye"" and ""Things that I Regret"" are the the best three songs on the CD (first three ... funny about that?). It's a typical and smart approach to song layout on an album- put your best stuff at the top to draw listeners in.
No criticism from me - I think she's great and can do no wrong - I saw Brandi C live at the world famous MSG a few months back and this album performed live is phenomenal.

Footprints is my favorite. I listen to it all the time.
Heart is Black is great too. the rest of the CD is good bu not earth-shaking. I'm thinking if one was to buy songs from itunes or Amazon - the first two songs are the only must-owns.

86357,12631,11159,"He had an incredibly soulful voice and was an exceptionally gifted musician to boot. Young ""Stevie"" Winwood as he was known back then was just 18 years old when the Spencer Davis Group burst onto the scene in early 1967. Within just a few months the group boasted a pair of Top Ten singles. Yes, the future appeared extremely bright for this four man band from Birmingham, England. But Stevie Winwood had other ideas. Before the end of the year he would leave the Spencer Davis Group to form his own band that he dubbed Traffic. Winwood's timing was impeccable because Top 40 radio was just beginning to wane and within just a few years album-oriented rock stations would come to dominate the FM band. Over the next decade Traffic would become a staple of these AOR radio stations. In 1969 Winwood also became a part of rock's very first supergroup Blind Faith. Then in 1980 Steve Winwood would embark on a highly successful solo career.

During the decade of the 1980's Steve Winwood would amass more than a dozen charted singles including 6 Top Ten hits.  Of these the most  acclaimed was hit 1986 # 1 hit ""Higher Love"".  With background vocals from Chaka Kahn ""Higher Love"" would spend a total of 22 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 pop chart.  The song would snag a couple of Grammys including ""Record of the Year"" and ""Pop Male Vocal"" of the year.  One of the best singles of the 1980's.",1470873600,5

86391,14232,10237,"This album is infinitely better than the ridiculousness that was the ""pop and lock"" of Trespassing. Lambert's vocals are put on better display here, and his material is more mature. Lambert has an incredible voice, one that should not be hidden behind a bunch of overly produced disco beats, and he's treated much better on this album. Good stuff. Still, nothing compares to ""For Your Entertainment,"" which is a shame, but this record comes much closer than Trespassing did and even shows a more sensitive, toned-down and brooding side to Lambert.",1470873600,4
86392,10648,13010,"Peter Calandra combines some truly marvelous compositions with larger than life piano performance to create sheer music magic. First Light has some sublime music in its thirteen tracks which explore the genius of his composing talents. ""Open Your Heart"" gladdens the heart. I loved this track from the first time I listened to it. So simple, yet so eloquent! ""First Light"" is literally like watching a sunrise, or the creation of the universe :-) This is an enchanting piece of music...the pure tones of the flute are like water...light and ever changing. ""Sunset Sky"" is has a hushed quality to it, the piano works mellifluously through the ever changing chords to create a divine melody. The mood of well-being and love continues with ""Keep The Faith"" a wonderful piano solo with minimalist background music.....I could just keep listening to this track! :-) There is a desolation in the sounds of the piano in its opening bars in ""Inner Secrets"" which touched me deeply. This is also a highly atmospheric track with great ambiance. ""Circle The Time"" has a superb string accompaniment, brought spring to my mind. The sheer beauty and majesty of the piano left me speechless! All the tracks of this remarkable album are worth repeat listens and will just keep growing and growing in one's mind :-) :-)",1470873600,5
86393,18,11116,"Music: 5 stars; Historical value: 5 stars

The B-52s released their near-perfect, ok perfect, debut album in July, 1979. Only a month later while on tour, opening up for the Talking Heads, someone most thankfully had the wits and foresight to tape this set on August 24, 1979 in Boston (it blows the mind that is almost 37 years ago to the day). Never mind that the tapes sat undiscovered in a vault for DECADES, but better late than never I suppose for this to see the light of day.

""Live! 8.24.79"" (9 tracks; 39 min.) is amazing on so many levels, I don't even know where to begin. Let's start with the music: since they just released their debut album one would think that their set would comprise overwhelmingly of songs from that album. But you might be wrong! Only 5 of the 9 songs from their set come from the debut album (52 Girls, 6060-0842, Lava, Dance This Mess Around; Rock Lobster). The remaining 4 tracks (Private Idaho, Devil In My Car, Runnin' Around, Strobe Light) all would eventually appear on the band's second album released in September, 1980. In a sense, you could call this set a mini-greatest-hits-live of their 2 best/most essential albums. As for the band, they are ON FIRE, absolutely amazing. When you hear Ricky Wilson's guitar work (absolutely shredding it), you realize once again what a force of life this guy was (and how much he is missed by the band after his passing in 1985). Cindy, Katie and Fred certainly shine as well, but knowing now what would happen to Ricky only 6 years after this recording, I'm sorry but he (and his legacy) towers over this recording. The audio quality of this recording is simply amazing, again keeping in mind that this collected dust for almost 4 decades...

I've seen the B-52s in concert a number of times, but never when they were at their most essential, early in their career (I didn't get to the US until the mid-80s), like on this set. If you are a fan of the B-52s, be it casual or die-hard, or if you simply are a fan of great music, you will absolutely want to pick this up and revel in this not-quite 40 min. set. I have no idea how the Talking Heads fared as the headliner (fine, I suppose), but I gotta believe that David Byrne must've thought ""holy crap, the opening band is blowing everyone away, how are we going to play after THAT?"", ha! ""Live! 8.24.79"" is HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1470873600,5

86408,12631,4606,"For my money they are the most important American rock and roll band in history. They were a phenomenon to be sure. And the statistics would tend to back up these assertions. Whether you were addicted to Top 40 radio in the 1970's or a fan of progressive or classic rock you were sure to find the music of Chicago emanating from your radio.

It all began with an LP entitled ""Chicago Transit Authority"" released in the spring of 1969. While the album would never attain Top Ten status it would remain on the charts a staggering 171 weeks! And from this LP would emerge a couple of classic hit singles ""Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is"" and a tune appropriately entitled ""Beginnings"". And Chicago would never look back. Over the next two decades the band would have over four dozen hit singles and produce some of the finest and most successful albums of the period. ""Beginnings"" was originally released as a single in 1969 and it failed to make the charts. Columbia decided to re-release the single in June 1971 and it would become the band's fourth Top Ten hit.

86436,7472,18716,"""Animalism"" stands as one of the finest albums the original incarnation of The Animals recorded. Release on the MGM label back in 1966, it was the last gasp (at least until they regrouped for two final albums) of a band that burned bright during the mid-60's.

There are two versions currently out there of the album--the original 12 track stereo album reissued by Hip-O-Select in 2006 which, sadly, has gone out of print. The second version features a good needle drop of the long out of print mono version of the album. It's a pretty good needle drop. The CD release includes 11 bonus tracks including BBC tracks and other live performances from the second incarnation of The Animals. It's also a bootleg from a Swedish label called Flawed Gems.

I would suggest asking who put out the CD (i.e., the name of the label) before purchasing this if you want the stereo version of the album which is pulled from the existing master tapes vs. the mono which is pulled from a good needle drop of the vinyl with some great to fair sounding bonus tracks pulled from a show in Germany from January 1967 with the new line up (which would later be called Eric Burden and The Animals) featuring only Barry Jenkins from The Nashville Teens who had played with the previous incarnation of The Animals replacing original drummer John Steel).

I would suggest sending an inquiry to the seller as Amazon has a bad habit of lumping these products together (and did when I recently purchased this--it was no biggie for me because I didn't have the mono or live tracks album).

The artwork is basically a scan of the original vinyl cover but the booklet is bare bones.

 If you want the stereo version of the album, I would look for the Hip-O which is also drawn from the tapes for the album.",1470960000,5

86440,15832,18717,"Eschewing the nautical themes of the debut for a more land-based aural assault, Wilderun have returned to rule my speakers.  This is epic in a cinematic way.  The songs weave between acoustic guitar, autoharp & hammered dulcimer folkiness, orchestral bombast, soft-sung clean vocals and roaring gutturals during the most metal of the passages.  Evan Berry's vocals remind me of Joel Ekeloff from ex-Opeth drummer Martin Lopez's Soen and Tomi Joutsen from Amorphis.

86444,4505,18719,"Someone else reviewed this and said it has a very 1950's sound. I agree with that as far as the instrumentation goes. The vocals are a little more modern. The lead singer reminds me of Tom Petty's voice with a completely different singing style. It's an interesting blend. I like it.

None of the tracks here are bad. I liked everyone of them. A few are 3 star tracks that are okay. Most are 4 star tracks that are pretty good. A few are solid 5 star tracks that really kick though. ""Rhythm Don't Lie"" is a great example of an awesome 5 star track. It's just classic up beat good old fashion rock and roll!

All in all this is worth a listen. I enjoyed it.

Rhythm Don't Lie is the best song on the album. If you've only got time for one song, I recommend that one.",1470960000,4

86451,4505,18721,"If you're not familiar with what this is, it's not 'songs'. Its fast paced instrumental tracks with no vocals.

It's extremely well done! Somehow it tells a story and conveys emotions without a single word being uttered. That's powerful music. And it's not repetitive. Instrumental only albums often get old by the 3rd track because sounds and themes keep repeating themselves. This one stays fresh the whole way through.

I ride my bike to work and I listened to this on the ride in today. I was pretty amped up the whole ride!

Maybe it's because he's doing more rock than country or because there are so many ballads.  I would have appreciated more sh#t-kickin' up-tempo country tunes.  I WILL say this for any of Vince's CD's...his ballads can make you cry and he has a penchant for finding backup harmony singers with incredible voices.  Same holds true here.

86499,12631,6869,"Originally known as The Detroit Spinners, this group was discovered by Moonglows great Harvey Fuqua around 1960. In fact their very first release ""Thats What Girls Are Made For"" was done in The Moonglows style. The Spinners were signed by Berry Gordy in the early 60's but struggled mightily to find their sound. They released a dozen or so singles before finally hitting paydirt in 1970 with ""It's A Shame"".

Convinced that the group needed to go in an entirely different direction, good friend Aretha Franklin convinced they to leave Motown and sign with Atlantic Records where she introduced them to producer Thom Bell. This was a match made in heaven. And as they say the rest is history. One of their first big records at Atlantic was ""Could It Be I'm Falling In Love"" in early 1973. The song spent 15 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 peaking at #4 and was a #1 on the R&B charts as well. Great song!",1470960000,5

Doing covers seems to be the order of the day...and Cyndi did a fine job on this album.  I probably wouldn't have chosen some of the tunes she did.  But then that's what makes Cyndi Cyndi.  Like, when you have an opportunity to sing a ballad with Vince Gill, why pick ""You're The Reason Our Kids Are Ugly""?

86529,2571,12257,"I hope that Sugarland will get back together.  They mad a lot of great music first as a trio then as a duet.  This is an interesting cd because with all the great music they mad and after all the hits they had.  Their label didn''t come out with this.  Cracker Barrel did.  It is a very good cd.  I also kind of have an interesting history of buying cds by Sugarland.  I either buy everything an artist will come out with or I will Just buy their Greatest Hits.  But with them I bought their first cd because of the song Got To Be Something More.  Bought their Love On The Inside because of the song Life In A Northern Town and bought their live cd because of the DVD. And they are all good.  And I love the DVD.
So not having all their cds there were some songs on here that I didn't have.  Like Stuck Like Glue and Settlin'.  Their weren't any new songs on here.  And I did have most of the songs already like Something More.  This is a very good cd that gets played quite a bit.",1470960000,4

86539,128,18730,"Famous, veteran Rhymesayers duo Atmosphere (emcee Sean Slug Daley and producer Anthony Ant Davis) from Minneapolis have come a long way and are on their eighth studio album, Fishing Blues (Aug. 12/Rhymesayers Entertainment), but theyve always been consistently good with their music, even on this their new present to us. The blended music and vocals here are top quality as Slug spins his involved, intricate lyrics around Ants modestly diversified new arrangements, all mastered to crisp audio perfection. Nothing on Fishing Blues deviates from the established Atmosphere standard, but its a fine, respectable set of records to be accurate.

Slug, like always, raps on a little bit of everything so to speak: self-deprecation, everyday drudgery, misfortune, love, romance and also minute-by-minute relationship feelings and thoughts. All make for a mainly clean, traditional, cozy and safe hip-hop experience by these major players from the land of 10,000 lakes. In one moment, Slug very lightly touches on discrimination, prejudice and the great difference between the living-standards of the bottom and top classes of society, and the most controversy we get is guest Kool Keiths insertion in When The Lights Go Out that money truly has no value (after all, what does have value is help, contribution, sharing, labor, sacrifice, donation, devotion and the like), so from one perspective, just about everything on Fishing Blues is safe sheltered territory for Atmosphere.

The quality artistry of this product with the good mixing and the well chosen sounds and tones coupled with Slugs clear, rich rapping is still remarkable though. Plus, the guests including DOOM, Aesop Rock and The Grouch are unbeatable. The only real noticeable cause for concern is that Atmosphere are somewhat too comfortable in their usual mode and style at this point. Fishing Blues makes the cut, but the overall impression and feel of this album is so much like that of the last three Atmosphere albums that a switch-up would have been more appreciated. For the most part however, this remains a distinctively unique project from the solid unmistakeable Midwestern group.",1470960000,3

With the lead single I Got The Boy and going from there.  Every song on this cd is good.  And could be a hit.  Although that has been the only song that has gotten any air play.  Just like her first cd only had one hit also.  If she can start having hits consistantly she will be up there with Miranda and Carrie.  I hope that she can and she has my support.

Although you may know him mostly from Pantera,Down,Superjoint & the Illegals this is more heavy,like blend his Viking Crown,Necrophagia,Arson Anthem & Christ Inversion into a behemoth of a blender and you get this fast-paced slab of brutality. Amazing face shredding guitars and heavy as hell drums,double kicks and thick slabs of bass & distortion. Super fast,super heavy death/black metal style.

86576,3671,18734,"I'll have to admit I have very mixed feelings about this album. One positive thing I can say is that this album is most certainly better than their last album as I would say this one has more memorable hits to it than ""Mind Over Matter"" did. However, I would not say that this album has another ""Cough Syrup"" on it by any means. There are most certainly tracks on here that are catchy and enjoyable but then begins the big problem I have with this record. It's electronic sound. You can tell the band is jumping onto the New Wave electronic bandwagon that every other Indie artist is going towards nowadays. Some artists do this transition well but I can't say Young The Giant makes this transition 100%. On a track like 'Something To Believe In"" I would say it's done relatively well but on others it sounds cringeworthy and like you're listening to a side project of the group than actual Young The Giant. Despite this, if you're a big fan of the group you'll find some enjoyment here but don't expect the same quality like the result of their self-titled debut.",1470960000,3

The next track Stairway to Spirits has a hauntingly beautiful quality to it. Very very lovely:-) Poppy is utterly charming with its lilting tones, this one is a keeper. Between Ages has something very ancient and timeless at its heart. I especially love the progression of the track, the melody is beautiful:-) 5AM is aptly titled, this track has that silent and expectant quality of dawn, the promise of a beautiful day. I love it!! Keep Trying , Opening, A Rose Revealed , Somewhere Over The RainbowI cant decide which I like better, they are all so mellifluous and enchanting. There is a rather haunting and very graceful track called Childrens Crusade .The melody is simply magnificent. Petals Falling Onto Water has the most breathtaking visual appeal, I could almost see petals falling in tandem with the each drop of the piano keys. This is a gorgeous track :-) .

In 1960, at the age of 17 Mary Wells presented ""Bye Bye Baby"", a tune she had written for Jackie Wilson, to Wilson's producer Berry Gordy, Jr. Good move. Gordy was duly impressed with the young lady and signed her to his newly formed label Motown. As it turns out ""Bye Bye Baby"" was her first single on Motown and did well enough to merit additional releases. 1962 turned out to be a huge year for Mary Wells when all three of her singles reached the Top Ten nationally. Of these, my favorite is ""Two Lovers"" which would peak at #7 in early 1963. I think this is my favorite Mary Wells recording.",1471046400,5

86630,56,4152,"Hard to believe that it has been over 30 years since Sting had started his successful solo career, after he had said goodbye to The Police. Honestly, the songs that Sting has done on his own all this time, absolutely stand taller than just the days of Punk he had with Stewart and Andy. Sting has made some really remarkable songs, and they are definitely much better than the jokes that are on radio today, who do not even have a sliver of the soul that Sting has had for years in music. One of my favorite songs Sting came out with back in the 90's, Desert Rose is one of those melodic and spiritual songs that still is very upbeat and hypnotic to the soul that still sounds just as driven today, as you would expect from Sting himself. I have loved this song for years, and it still strikes at the heart of the matter as one of his best songs ever. It is just too sad that the stars of today, well the overexposed jokes of Beyonce' Knowles and Rihanna, cannot even have a single song that can drive from the bloom of the flower like Sting has. If you have never even heard a Sting song before, well this is one of my Top 5 picks from his illustrious works of art that I suggest that you do go to.

86673,9069,17307,"Its been ten years since Raes 2006 debut single, Put Your Records On, a funky flapjack of old-school R&B.  Its echoes are clearly heard in Hearts Green Aphrodisiac, a cache of 70s-style quiet storm, complete with serene Fender Rhodes, growling and lightly slapped bass, skittering delayed guitar plucks, and cooed background harmonies (featuring Esperanza Spalding), topped with Raes increasingly animated vocals.  She parts the clouds with unyielding optimism in The Skies Will Break; the song opens with a catchy Bm-A-D-G, Em-D-F#m-G piano figure, then flips to a punching G-A-Bbdim7-Bm progression that carries the song to heights unprecedented for Rae, only to break to nothing for the heart speaks in whispers chorus line  a perfect mix of dynamics and drive.  And except for the absence of stratospheric trills, Do You Ever Think of Me is pure Minnie Riperton in its unvarnished innocence.  Rae may not possess powerhouse pipes, but she consistently connects nonetheless.  Her disarming charm, like that of Billie Holiday, signals a wellspring of soul.",1471046400,5

Yes, she sings on key. Yes, she can belt it out. Unfortunately though, her vocals sometimes sound more like she is shouting the song and not singing. Grace Slick's voice was like that too, but hers was dynamic, while often Katy sounds like she is barking the lyrics at you. Prism is not the only album she does this on, but it's simply the most recent.

86741,56,18194,"There is honestly no question that there sincerely has been a huge lag of female artists that could've had more of the talent, if they actually delivered with better choices in song. That has not been the case with acts like Rihanna or Beyonce, which have had more overexposure as products, not people. Unfortunately, that also has been the case with Fifth Harmony. They just haven't had the chemistry that other girl groups have had from En Vogue, Salt N' Pepa or even The Supremes. When I heard their last single Write On Me, I thought they were growing up with better chemistry in their work, but the third single is more like a lag in their song choices. All In My Head (Flex,) the third single from their second album 7/27, tries to bring in a more reggae style in their works. Unfortunately, it didn't feel like the gals delivered, and tried to do what Tamar Braxton did last year with Angels & Demons, that fell down from the sounds the diva could've brought out. For Fifth Harmony, I found this song to lag from the exposure they've received from Worth It last year. Hopefully, the gals of Fifth Harmony can find much better than what they've already came out with.

86746,12631,4070,"The Soul Survivors, originally from New York City, were a white garage-rock band. The boys grew up listening to the R & B groups of the 1950s. The sounds of groups like The Moonglows, The Heartbeats, and Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers would have a profound influence on founding group members Charlie and Rich Ingui.

In the mid 1960's The Soul Survivors began to build a strong following, playing venues in Atlantic City and Philadelphia. Enjoying great success in Philadelphia, they attracted the attention of record producers Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff. Into the recording studio they went, emerging with "" Expressway To Your Heart "" a song that would climb to #3 on Billboard's R&B chart and #4 on the Hot 100 Singles pop chart. The success of ""Expressway"" would become Gamble and Huff's first ""crossover"" hit when it began to be played on both black and white radio stations.

In polls taken by both the Philadelphia Inquirer and Philadelphias City Paper, "" Expressway"" was voted the number one record ever to come out of Philadelphia.  It's easy to see why.",1471132800,5

86794,5846,18744,"UPDATED REVIEW:
This review is similar to one I will write for a number of new albums and is essentially a statement.

It seems that more and more record labels are choosing NOT to include digital downloads with vinyl purchases which I think is absolutely unacceptable given that the cost of the album on vinyl is usually more than *double* that of a CD or straight digital download, and because recording a vinyl to digital format is a bit of a pain when compared to ripping a CD. I was happy years ago when more and more labels began offering digital downloads with the purchase of a record, but that seems to have changed with the popularity of vinyl again increasing steadily. When you factor in that the cost of vinyl has been increasing right along with that popularity with no added benefits other than the label receiving more money then I get angry. Of the past 4 albums I've purchased, 3 have not included a digital tracks from lables Shanachie Entertainment, Not Now Music, and even freaking RCA.

My apologies for the 2-star review, but this needs to change. Not Now Music should offer a digital download and I""ll revise my review to reflect the album rather than what I did not receive. I'm just tired of this and will simply resort to streaming or pirating album releases that don't provide what has become expected and standard in the past decade, simple as that. If hosting and bandwidth resources are at the crux of these cutbacks then just include a simple paper-sleeved CD instead as some labels have done for quite a while. And, if that is still too much cost, forgo the ""fashionable"" heavy weight, double LP release for a simple, more cost-effective single LP release. Double LP, 120g albums are almost always unnecessary anyway and take up too much space on my shelf let alone having to flip the record twice as often.

Here ends my rant. I'm not going to buy albums at these prices any longer if this is the direction we're heading. At double or TRIPLE the price of a CD, digital tracks are nothing but a courtesy. Period.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
Near Perfection - One of my favorite collections in any genre, from any artist. The 3 LP vinyl is gorgeous and masterfully done. Whoever rated this one star for not being a 'live' album should be banned from Amazon.",1471132800,2

It's refreshing to hear a young voice expressing his faith in a time when there is so much secularism in our country--I mean the I-Phone is God it seems to a lot of kids and the X-Box is their diversion from thinking about where they came from and where there going. Parker's voice is stringent at times, but never lacks for sincerity. There's some good old fashioned revival Rock & Roll flavored Gospel here with great musician backing.",1471132800,5

86809,12631,8480,"Just learned of the passing of Glenn Yarbrough at the age of 86. Glenn was a founding member of the folk trio The Limeliters who were extremely popular during the folk revival of the late 1950's and early 1960's. Among The Limeliters best known tunes were ""A Dollar Down"" (their only charted single), ""There's a Meetin' Here Tonight"", ''City of New Orleans,"" and ""Lonesome Traveler."" Glenn left the group in 1963 to pursue a solo career. Glenn had two songs reach the Billboard Hot 100. The biggest of the two was 1965's ""Baby, The Rain Must Fall"" which was the title song of a motion picture starring Lee Remick and Steve McQueen. The song peaked at #12 on the pop charts and climbed to #2 on the Adult Contemporary charts. It was always a joy to hear this tune. RIP Glenn!",1471132800,5

86828,13819,17241,"How can a band that has been around this long produce yet another album of this high quality and magnitude? I know I should trust Radiohead ever since I discovered them 24 years ago. But I always listen to a new Radiohead album objectively. I listen to it alone and with friends. For me and my friends, a Radiohead album is an event - something to listen to over a few beers.

The reviews here say enough. But my short take is that Moon Shaped Pool is a dark yet melodic journey. The themes are dark and depressing. And late in the album, with The Numbers and Present Tense, Radiohead dive into folk, and that alone is surprising and fascinating. But I just can't get over the sad beauty of Daydreaming and Indentikit. Sparse lyrics, complex arrangements, haunting sounds. And how about True Love Waits as the final song - a track that took nearly 20 years to arrange and produce the way the band wanted.

This is the same band that blew us away with OK Computer, Kid A, and Hail to the Thief. They have reached another stunning peak. The best band in the world. The last great band in the world. When they are gone, that's all folks. We have plenty of good bands (Interpol, Arcade Fire, Wilco have a new album this fall). But Radiohead is as good as any English language rock band can get this late in the album era.",1471132800,5

I have seen Blake Shelton live and he puts on a good show.  And he has some good songs.  And his hits are on here.  But for whatever reason I haven't liked him as much as some other artists around.

86859,12631,5464,"When you take a look at Frank Sinatra's long and prolific recording career the numbers are simply staggering. Frank had his first big hit as lead vocalist of the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra in 1940 with ""I'll Never Smile Again"". Sinatra would go solo just a couple of years later. Over the next four decades Frank would amass an astonishing total of 145 hit singles including such memorable hits as ""The Lady Is A Tramp"", ""Come Fly With Me"", ""Strangers In the Night"" and of course his signature tune ""My Way"".

After a decade at Columbia Records Frank Sinatra made the move to Capitol in the spring of 1953. Most Sinatra buffs agree that he did his finest work while at Capitol. Frank made a number of unforgettable recordings at Capitol with the legendary arranger, composer and bandleader Nelson Riddle. Among them was an Oscar-award winning tune from the motion picture ""The Joker Is Wild"" which Frank starred in. Released in October of 1957 ""All The Way"" would spend a remarkable 30 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 Singles chart peaking at #2.  This is the original hit recording.",1471219200,5

86924,2402,18756,"CCR was a four-piece American rock & roll/blues band led by brothers Tom and John Fogerty popular from 1967 until their acrimonious demise in 1972. CCR wrote and recorded a string of hits and are still, 40 years on, a common sound on American local - and national - radio. If you're too young to remember the band in their heyday, you will probably still recognise many of their best-known songs when you hear them. Although all four could sing well, John Fogerty emerged as the principal vocal sound of the band and became songwriter-in-chief.

This is a good collection of 20 of CCRs best-known songs including all-time greats Suzy Q, Proud Mary, Lodi, Down on the Corner, Travellin Band, Up around the Bend and the timeless Have you ever seen the Rain?.

Bad Moon Rising was later made famous with movie-going audiences as the soundtrack to An American Werewolf in London; an alternative 2003 compilation titled BMR contains identical track listing to the first volume of this this collection and in addition Wrote a Song for Everyone & Born on the Bayou, so you may choose to go for that.

The bands unusual name reportedly came from combining three disparate elements, and was finally decided on because it was a name even weirder than Buffalo Springfield or Jefferson Airplane.",1471305600,4

86926,1026,17679,"Sometimes the littlest things can make you say ""What the...."". Last night while sleeping I had this dream that I was in Memphis and I walked into Sun Records. Lo and behold I see Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Elvis. Roy Orbison must been out of town or something. Anyways I'm watching them and than Sam Phillips says ""Alright fellers let's lay down some tracks."" They all grab their instruments except for The Killer. He just sits at the piano. Some guy was playing drums but I couldn't make out the face. He had long hair though and was wearing clothes from the 70's. He starts counting down and they start playing but it was nothing like they ever played before. It was straight up OSDM! Elvis was doing the vocals and man he was brutal.  Johnny and Carl were just headbanging to the riffs. Jerry Lee set his piano on fire and I swore I seen Demons rise from  it and swim around them as they played. The drums were tight. This went on for what seemed like forever. Once they were done they all came up to where Elvis was standing and looked at Sam Phillips and I in the control booth. Sam was smiling and than they all raised their fists and said ""That was for you Chuck"". I woke up and was perplexed. It was so real. I had ringing in my ears. I than realized that them fellers were paying their respects to Chuck Schuldiner's band Death. So I guess what Gruesome did here was pretty much the same thing.",1471305600,5

Seeing them in the sky is as close as you should get...ever. This song sums up Lynyrd Skynyrd. The older VanZandt brother and a couple of other band members and crew died in a crash. It seems very odd to me that so many great musicians lost their lives jetting around. These guys lived they're lives just like the moral of this song. They did not play for fame and fortune. They never let themselves be changed one bit when all the other bands were going ""hair band."" They were good ol' boys from Alabama that played songs that had a certain timeless and profound pride in being just that: good folks. Skynyrd touched so many of us (now middle aged) people when WE were the future. It was our turn to run the world, and being humble, respectful, and doing the right thing was important. Now that we've retired, the world is way too small, and common courtesy seems but a distant memory. Everything they put out went platinum. Their first song, to the last, was straight up American. The whole Rock Music world mourned when that plane went down. That was it. The other members went back home and would have never played again. BUT! Those guys knew that the older brother, Johnny, I believe (God forgive me if I've got the two mixed up) would want them to try to show the world what was being lost and try to get people to just slow down, realise what is truly important in life; forget greed, be kind and respectful, and just live, simple. Because, ""if you do, you will be satisfied."" Fans of all different kind of music came to see a band that was not really a band any more. All these people came to listen and give their respects. Skynyrd toured one more time. The younger VanZandt brother finally put his grief away for long enough to tour one more time. The whole venue was packed. We went and seen them at Starwood Amphitheatre in Nashville. The younger brother wore a flat brimmed hat just like his older brother used to. He stepped up to the mic and did something he swore not to do...it just hurt too bad: He sang his brothers songs. They played, I swear it was like Jonny was there. Freebird was last song of course....

And that's all I have to say about that.",1471305600,5

I loved the melody of this song :-) Hassett's voice is powerful and effective in ""Guerreira Vai"", with a memorable chorus line. ""Sangue da Terra"" has a languid, lazy rhythm, and very very romantic feel to it..this song transported me to a tropical island :-) ""A Little More Blue"" is a poignant song,, with very soulful lyrics and Hassett's voice is magical in this one...loved it!

86984,8284,17043,"I love Rick Braun's albums and have them all. I count the minutes until the next one drops. But if you also love the music of Whalum and Brown as much as I do, then BWB is an album you need to purchase asap!

It is the third release from BWB and the BEST ONE BY FAR!!!!

BWB represents one of the most exciting jazz supergroups to hit the music scene in a LONG time! All these musicians come from the jazz-pop and smooth jazz genres, which I LOVE, but BWB adds the additional ingredient of classic, old school dance-flavored R&B to make this album REALLY primo! (For a lover of both jazz and R&B, this was like getting BOTH chocolate and peanut butter in one awesome snack.)

As some smooth jazz artists make the gradual move to jazz fused with classic R&B (can we say Culbertson), I, for one, REALLY welcome this development as albums tend to be higher energy, much more upbeat and exciting, reminding me more of classic fusion albums than the softer and slower smooth jazz albums of the past. Such is the case with BWB ...

This album moves between jazz funk and R&B and totally GETS ITS GROOVE ON - never letting up!

From the soulful and funky opening jazz track (my favorite on the album) you know you are in the best of hands as Braun, Whalum and Brown take turns showcasing their trumpet, sax and guitar stylings in the coolest, most hip ways possible!

I LOVE all the songs on this album and they only get better the more you listen to them! I highly recommend this album with a very enthusiastic FIVE STARS (only because 10 stars was not an option). Run ... do not walk ... to purchase this album. This is a jazz album ... but it WILL make you want to dance!!! Keep up the good work, guys :-)",1471305600,5
86985,12631,12831,"He is the #1 novelty recording artist in rock & roll history. He placed nearly 40 songs on the Billboard Hot 100 Pop charts and for over two decades was a fixture on Billboard's Top Country Singles chart. And the man could croon with the best of them! Ray Stevens certainly made his mark on the American music scene. Much like the late Charlie Rich, another incredibly gifted and versatile performer, Ray Stevens might have achieved even greater commercial success had he concentrated on just one or two genres. But there were simply too many sides to Ray Stevens to allow that to happen. And he was a very gifted songwriter to boot.

In April 1969 Monument records released what just might be Ray's most creative and entertaining tune ever. ""Gitarzan"" is a novelty song about a character who lives in the jungle and forms a musical band with his female partner, Jane and their pet monkey. The song features Tarzan yells, scat singing, and a funky Boogie Woogie, as well as a quote from the song ""Swinging on a Star"", with the line ""Carrying Moonbeams Home in a Jar"" sung with the wrong notes.

The films most lasting contribution to the arts was the introduction of William Friedkin as a mainstream director. Friedkin had been directing documentaries, but it was this collaboration with Sonny Bono that launched his feature filmmaking career. The film is an interesting lark, capturing mid-60s mood, design and a bit of artistic ennui, but without the acidic bite of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Head/dp/6305038694/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Head</a>. The original eight-song soundtrack gave Bono a chance to stretch out, and added several excellent titles to the Sonny & Cher catalog.

Leading off is a waltz-time instrumental version of the duos signature I Got You Babe, a title that appears again at the soundtracks end in a fetching acoustic arrangement. In between is Sonnys perfectly self-deprecating Its the Little Things in all its proto-Spectorian grandeur, its B-side Cher showcase Dont Talk to Strangers, the sultry B-side Im Gonna Love You (originally released as a Cher solo on Imperial in 1965), and several songs lifted from the soundtrack with lead-in dialogue. The latter include the stage-hall styled title tune and another of Sonnys self-deprecating, average-guy love songs, Just a Name.

The bonus tracks include the single Plastic Man and its B-side edit of Its the Little Things. The latter shortens the album track by dropping the middle stanza of the refrain. Earlier reissues have included only the edited version, so the full album take turns out to be the real bonus. Varese has used the true mono master, unlike One Ways&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/1999-reissue/dp/B00003TFVL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">1999 reissue</a>, and though quite listenable, the fidelity still isn't the best that the era offered.

87023,11051,18767,"The Glowing Swans

by

Rob Jones

WOW! This is a remarkable, raw, riotous plus often raucous and rough ride but one tumultuous trip which takes the listener on an epic journey through the burning fires of Satans well stoked fireplace-and, to come out the other side whether through prayer, spirit or fortune is a triumph. Swans via the double disc of The Glowing Man form a recipe that has the feel of:

*Carnage Visors the bonus instrumental set that accompanied the Faith album as created The Cure.
 *Mogwai music that followed on from the aforementioned work from Robert Smith and his cohorts.
 *The demonic drive of the recently deceased Alan Vega and his Suicide CV. Think in particular his howls and yelps -primarily those Frankie Teardrop cries. This banshee bawl is accompanied by the sonorous assists of sidekick Marty Rev (but given an industrial strength mix and then the volume is turned to one hundred louder!). NB There is even a song entitled Frankie M present!
 *The hells bells theatrics and die for the cause screams of Nick Cave within the manic momentum of The Birthday Party. For this is also a soundtrack that vaults from the sonic swamps and then pounces to ambush your mind, soul and leave every part of your body tingling with fear!

Swans clock up songs that turn in to alt. rock symphonic stomps that can range from several to the nearly 29 minutes of the title track-a charge which puts one in mind of The Fall-and, the juggernaut assaults of Reformation as well as Auto Chip 2014-2016. However, to keep this fury going for nearly half an hour is some achievement-especially as the listener is left dangling on that cliff edge. Ironically we are taken from this point to the closing chorus of Finally Peace which is more Polyphonic Spree in its arias overtones.

The stated two offerings close this affair but there is plenty of uneasy, unsettling listening across eight tracks which fall just 43 seconds short of two hours! Big in sound, big in performance and big in length! However, Swans can dip away from the furore, but mostly it is the humongous that constitutes the contents of this heavyweight release.

This is a record has a religious, spiritual edge shifting between beauty and the camp of the wounded beast. However, Swans led by Michael Gira cannot be accused of doing anything by half measures-and, a band that arrived in 1982 could slip off in to a land of deep and dark ballads and still prove a point. However, that is not to be as this behemoth wants its audience to feel the roar of its power.

After disbanding in 1997, Swans returned with the acclaimed albums: My Father Will Guide Me Up A Rope To The Sky (2010), The Seer (2012) and To Be Kind (2014). All in the name of love Gira decided to carve a new path for Swans and that meant carving out a new rock route that may borrow minimal elements of their past to forge a new future.

Along with primarily Norman Westberg, Kristof Hahn, Phil Puleo, Christopher Pravdica, Thor Harris and Bill Riefin the channel taken is not one that has commercial aims but artistic goals. Gira states whatever the force is that has led us through this extended excursion, its been worthwhile for many of us, and Im grateful for what has been the most consistently challenging and fulfilling period of my musical life.

Brutal and vital! The Glowing Man is not for the weak and it is not for every week. Nonetheless, do no escape its merits. This is not The Byrds, The Housemartins The Eagles or A Flock of Seagulls-this is Swans-and, be prepared!",1471392000,5

87076,11051,18772,"Innocence reaches us All

by

Rob Jones

Of Montreal would be quite capable of pumping out standardised pop hits. However, such is their make up that the off kilter whether it is in the various musical tides or the surreal lyrical swathes it can turn the relatively usual to the incomparably unusual in the snap of ones fingers. The dozen tracks of Innocence Reaches does not disappoint with its smorgasbord of sonorous styles and lexicon of lively language.

There is commerciality aplenty in their mix but a move from those norms in to less subtle fields takes the listener on a range of journeys within one tune let alone the span of an album. Throughout this ride the punter can detect a multitude of influences. Lets Relate kicks off proceedings as a revved up Kraftwerk meets Depeche Mode on an electric 80s adventure. The quirky and assertive Different with Girls delivers its sermon and sonics in a robotic Euro spin of Kid Creole & the Coconuts-and, with a modification of the lyrics it deserves top end chart status. Gratuitous Abysses has the youthful drive of Iggy Pop and Sparks as a glam slam ensues. Then we slip in to My Fair Lady-a Luke Haines tinged (in title and taste) radio friendly piece. The white funk with rock meanderings of Les chants de Maldoror is a hymn according to the gospel of George Clinton split with an LCD Soundsystem sensibility. A sport and a Pastime in its jive aims straight for the cerebral of the teen market, although underneath the surface there is so much more happening. Ambassador Bridge pays homage to Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys and then technology takes us away from theose close harmonies. Def Pact comes across like a 70s Pink Floyd opus as Chaos Arpegiating morphs in to a contemporary stab at Syd Barrett and Lou Reed in some otherworldly unison. Meanwhile, there are similar components on Nursing Slopes but the overwhelming feel here is of the latter day pastoral wanderings of XTC.

The ability to defy simple pigeonholing is a skill especially as there is quality in the quantity. However, an almighty angular approach ices the seven minute plus force that is Chap Pilot which stands proud and loud! This the PIL/Neu!/Primal Scream hybrid thrives on a repetitive stomp and collective chant but it is a winner and closes affairs on the ultimate aural high!

Sometimes the artist has to intentionally court a little chaos in order to make one of the best, weirdest, brightest, catchiest, and most inventive albums in an already incredible catalogue. Of Montreal leader Kevin Barnes brings a lot to the table-and, he bonds an array of feelings and influences in order to create a masterpiece. This long player is a mark of two decades of mercurial creative mania. 60s psych-pop, funk, plus 70s glam/prog plus the paints of contemporary electronica, indie and Top 40 craft. Then those textures are coated with words that can devour personal pain and flights of fantasy touched by the wands of cultural capitals such as San Francisco, New York City and Paris. Barnes also assesses his marital breakdown and the single status that has altered his outlook on life. Lets not forget the kitchen sink, because whatever this review offers your own encounter with this record will bring a great deal more to the audience.

14 albums in and the modern world needs Of Montreal more than ever as their universal acceptability of everyone means that their Innocence Reaches us all.",1471392000,5

87082,5846,18773,"This review is similar to one I will write for a number of new albums and is essentially a statement.

Firstly, this new album by Hey Marseilles is excellent and the evolution of their style is wonderful. That's all I will say.

It seems that more and more record labels are choosing NOT to include digital downloads with vinyl purchases which I think is absolutely unacceptable given that the cost of the album on vinyl is usually more than *double* that of a CD or straight digital download, and because recording a vinyl to digital format is a bit of a pain when compared to ripping a CD. I was happy years ago when more and more labels began offering digital downloads with the purchase of a record, but that seems to have changed with the popularity of vinyl again increasing steadily. When you factor in that the cost of vinyl has been increasing right along with that popularity with no added benefits other than the label receiving more money then I get angry. Of the past 4 albums I've purchased, 3 have not included a digital tracks from lables Shanachie Entertainment, Not Now Music, and even freaking RCA.

My apologies to Hey Marseilles for the 2-star review, but this needs to change. Shanachie Records should offer a digital download and I""ll revise my review to reflect the album rather than what I did not receive. I'm just tired of this and will simply resort to streaming or pirating album releases that don't provide what has become expected and standard in the past decade, simple as that. If hosting and bandwidth resources are at the crux of these cutbacks then just include a simple paper-sleeved CD instead as some labels have done for quite a while. And, if that is still too much cost, forgo the ""fashionable"" heavy weight, double LP release for a simple, more cost-effective single LP release. Double LP, 120g albums are almost always unnecessary anyway and take up too much space on my shelf let alone having to flip the record twice as often.

Here ends my rant. I'm not going to buy albums at these prices any longer if this is the direction we're heading. At double or TRIPLE the price of a CD, digital tracks are nothing but a courtesy. Period.",1471392000,2

It is just great to listen and relax and enjoy these great songs. I grow up with so many of them.

87096,1751,18721,"This is an excellent new album from Russian Circles!

The first album of theirs I heard was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Geneva-2009/dp/B002N1AECS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Geneva (2009)</a>, which I still think is their best -- it is certainly my favorite.  ""Empros"" (2011) was nearly as good, but I was not impressed by the concluding vocal track.  I have since picked up ""Station"" (2008), which is also quite good, but certainly not equal to ""Geneva.""  And ""Memorial"" (2013) I found disappointing, a false step that did not convey the same sense of inspiring, headlong searching otherwise characteristic of the band's music.  I love a lot of black metal, and the ""blackening"" of some of the high-energy tracks was fine, but overall the songs were too simple and repetitive.

I am happy to say that with ""Guidance,"" the band is back on track!  This is their best album since ""Geneva.""  The album is well structured -- the opener, ""Asa,"" is an acoustic number, and it leads into the powerful, metallic ""Vorel.""  The ending is symmetrical with the beginning.  The next-to-the-last song is another very heavy number, ""Calla,"" and the concluding piece is the slower, quieter ""Lisboa,"" which is electric, but more meditative.  The three central songs are all of very high quality.  ""Afrika"" seems to get its name from the featured tribal drumming.  ""Overboard"" is an apt name for a song that is adrift, beautiful tones with no sense of forward momentum.  Producer Kurt Ballou gives the album a big, warm sound.

I have heard the instrumental Russian Circles -- Mike Sullivan on guitar, Brian Cook on bass, and Dave Turncrantz on drums -- described variously as post-rock or post-metal.  With several years of listening to the band and other roughly similar bands, I would say that post-rock is closer, but with some tracks (here they're ""Vorel"" and ""Calla"") more clearly metal-sounding.

I've never been that impressed by the Texas post-rock band Explosions In the Sky -- too pretty for me.  But Explosions has found work writing film scores.  Russian Circles has a perfectly cinematic sound, and I wonder why they too have not been called on to provide the music for films.  Perhaps it will still happen...

It's heartening to know that Chicago has produced some great music since I left there in the early Nineties.",1471478400,5

87159,9088,18780,"I just had the opportunity to review Heavy Days, the latest release from Katy Guillen & The Girls and I really like it. Opening with Driving To Wake Up, Katy Guillen & The Girls let you know right up front that they mean business. Guillen on lead vocal and guitar is joined by Claire Adams on bass and vocal and Stephanie Williams on drums producing an authoritative rock sound with edge. Guillen's vocals may be similar to Chrissie Hynde with healthy attitude but with more clarity and blending with the vocals of Adams, a new fresh sound. A stripped down 3 piece sound is all you need and these ladies show that big time. Guillen is also no wall flower when it comes to guitar attitude laying it out there pretty nicely. Heavy Days has an essential blues rock sound and raw energy but with just the right amount of melodic backing harmony to pull you in. These girls are putting on the heat and Williams kicks ass on drums... and that adds real weight as they swing from sweet vocals to heavy axe wielding. Absolutely excellent! Waking Up From You shows a more pop side with really smoothly crafted melody and instrumentation. This track could see solid radio play across genres with J. Santiago like guitar work. Don't Need Anyone is a solid rocker with straight forward beat and aggressive guitar soloing. Very nice. The Load has really nice bass lines by Adams under rhythm and vocals by Guillen. With it's more indie sound, it still has solid rock framework and excellent drum work leading to some less structured guitar work. Very interesting. Humbucker is a real nice blues rocker with standout lead vocals and a solid guitar riff. I am really blown away by how tight this band is and how powerful the rhythm section is. Really solid! Ballad, Cold Was The Night, is a brilliant showcase of Guillen's voice with traces of Amy Winehouse ... I mean seriously? This girl can really sing and her guitar playing is powerful... the entire band is. Mike ""Shinetop"" Sedovic adds some really nice key work on this track making this already super track even fatter. I mean, check out the rich guitar soloing on this one... think torment...think Big Brother. Excellent! Hot rocker, Can't Live Here Anymore, has a definite power pop feel with plenty of kick and solid rock. Big Joe Williams' Baby Please Don't Go has a sultry edge that I've never heard on any of the previous covers. Guillen really knows how to bring it and Guillen's original guitar vamp is perfect to frame her vocals. Raw and explosive this track is hot! This is a perfect example of how the blues continues to be vibrant in contemporary rock music. Love it! Wrapping the release is Pulling Up From The Grooves, a really sweet track, again based solidly on the strength of Guillen's beautiful voice and very complimentary backing by Adams. Adams' bass work, with light guitar rhythm, Ryan Heinlein's contributions on trombone and the ever sensitive drum work by Williams makes this an extremely memorable closer for a fine release. A definite keeper!

87163,12631,11040,"The group that later became The Miracles was formed in 1955 by five teenage friends from Detroit, Michigan, under the name The Five Chimes. Three of the founding members, Smokey Robinson, Pete Moore and Ronald White had been singing together since they each were around the age of eleven. The group, influenced by acts such as Billy Ward and His Dominoes and Nolan Strong & the Diablos, featured Clarence Dawson and James Grice in the original lineup. A chance meeting with with record producer Berry Gordy Jr. in 1957 would ultimately lead to a contract with Motown records. In addition, Smokey Robinson made major contributions to the success of Motown, a fact acknowledged by label founder Berry Gordy Jr., when he surprised the singer with a corporatevice president title in 1961.

During the 1960's the music of The Miracles would become a fixture on Top 40 radio. During that decade The Miracles would amass an impressive total of 24 Top 40 hits. In June 1967, shortly after Motown changed the name of the group to Smokey Robinson and The Miracles, Tamla records released ""More Love"". Here was yet another gorgeous ballad from the pen of Smokey Robinson. The tune would peak at #23 on the pop charts and reached #5 on the R&B charts.",1471478400,5

87176,15913,18783,"This CD is well written, well sung and played, and well recorded. It has none of the flaws of White's last Civil Wars CD and it would appear the baggage of that defunct group has been left behind.

The songs are, of course, the sort of wistful (but not sappy) love songs that White does very well. On several songs his backup singers are The Secret Sisters, a group whose centered singing is very compatible with the entire range of his style. By way of comparison, his previous group, The Civil Wars, paired him with a female vocalist who was very good at working with about 10% of his vocal color range. The Civil Wars pairing had difficulty connecting with his other 90% but the Secret Sisters do well with him.

There is an eclectic group of backup instrumentalists, all solid studio musicians, but with a sprinkling of other Grammy winning talent. Zac Cockrell on bass comes to mind; Zac is the giant upon whose shoulders Brittany Howard stood at the Grammys.

Within its context, the style has much variation but it is all White's work. I particularly like ""The Once and Future Queen"" with its passing resemblance to something you might have heard from early Don Mclean. ""Hope I Die"" and ""I'll Get Even"" have a style which seems like Damien Rice done right, or perhaps more like Paul Simon's early solo love songs. ""Hate the Way You love Me"" is, on first listening, to me the most ""Civil Wars-ish' of the selections. This particular one, Track 9, is also one which gives passing homage to classic Appalachian ballad style instrumentation and early 60s folk singers, but comes across as romantic and not contrived.

87178,1348,17534,"Although they went into exile with very little drama, it seemed a very real possibility back in 2012 that Thrice may never return. With band lynchpin/frontman Dustin Kensrue forsaking the music business for a gig with the Mars Hill Church and the genre they helped nurture seemingly being driven into the ground, it was almost a forgone conclusion that the glory days of albums like ""The Artist In The Amublance"" and ""Vheissu"" were in the rear-view mirror for good. Thankfully, such wasn't the case as ""To Be Everywhere Is To Be Nowhere"" -- the follow-up to 2011's ""Major/Minor"" and the band's ninth album overall -- sounds as if the guys never missed a beat.

Having parted ways with the aforementioned Mars Hill Cult...err...I mean Church amidst accusations of corruption (and the ultimate dissolution of the whole darn entity), it's no surprise that Kensrue returns to the fold with a force so strong you believe he could breath fire or make the Earth shake. Opening with the anthemic, tidal-wave riffing of ""Hurricane,"" it's clear from the get-go that the Thrice we've all come to know and love is still intact. Kensrue sounds as fired up as ever, while the band themselves are game, showing a unity and tightness few Warped Tour graduates have achieved. The overall sound and production of the album continues the organic approach taken by 2009's ""Beggars"" and ""Major/Minor"" but drives home with an intensity not heard since 2005's ""Vheissu."" Tracks like the Radiohead-inspired ""Salt & Shadow"" and earnest ""The Long Defeat"" take time for Kensrue to bleed his soul, while ""Stay With Me,"" a ballad that could be seen as corny in the wrong hands, benefits from the frontman's characteristic sincerity. On the other end of the spectrum, the dark and biting ""Black Honey"" takes aim at the United States government's continued insistence upon violating other countries and cultures in the name of profit, while heavier fare such as ""Blood On The Sand"" and ""Whisteblower"" in particular seem aimed at The Mars Hill Church quite specifically.

With a five year gap in between releases, it's incredible how rock solid Thrice's comeback is. There is not a moment of fat that could have been trimmed, just pure passion and intensity from front to back. ""To Be Everywhere Is To Be Nowhere"" carries all the weight and glory of past Thrice releases, with passion and hope for the future. Here's to Thrice catching their second wind. We needed it, and it sounds like they needed it even more.",1471564800,5

87190,6236,8463,"I'd like to preface this review by stating that I hadn't intended to purchase this CD but my father-in-law asked for it for his birthday and, since it came with the AutoRip MP3 versions as well, we automatically own it. I figured it couldn't hurt to give it a listen and I'm pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoy it! I like all kinds of music but mostly listen to country and pop and have been on a country kick this summer. Most of the Zac Brown Band songs I've heard in the past have been pure country so I was a bit surprised to hear several different styles of music on this album. Now, after having listened to it every day over the past week, I understand why the album is appropriately named ""Jekyll + Hyde.""

""Jekyll + Hyde"" features 16 songs and has a wide variety of musical genres. If you listen to a country music station, you've probably already heard songs like ""Beautiful Drug,"" ""Homegrown,"" and ""Castaway."" These three songs are some of my favorites on the album and I find them very easy to sing along to. ""Castaway"" has more of a Caribbean feel and sounds like a Jimmy Buffet type of song. Besides country and tropical-themed music, this album also has rock (""Junkyard""), folk (""Young and Wild"") and one reminiscent of Frank Sinatra (""Mango Tree"") which features Sara Bareilles. There are plenty of uptempo, fun songs that make me want to get up and dance (I actually have!) as well as some slow songs.

What started as a present for my father-in-law ended up being a very enjoyable gift for both of us since we are really enjoying ""Jekyll + Hyde."" We even had a conversation about this album this past weekend and since then, I've been listening to it more and more. If you are a die-hard country fan, this album may surprise you with how many genres can be heard on it but if you like many kinds of music, I think you'll enjoy it. Considering that I probably wouldn't have bought this album if it wasn't for my father-in-law, I'm glad I gave this album a chance because I really like it. I'll probably listen to more of Zac Brown Band's music now since I enjoyed this album so much!",1471564800,4

87196,10435,18785,"I haven't actually purchased this CD. And I won't. But I have listened to the tracks, so here's my review. There's this trend amongst some of my favorite bands where they decide to venture off and try new territory. The problem is that the old territory worked great, and they tend to lose their way. TRAPT were at their best with ""Someone In Control"". They've not only abandoned familiar territory, but they've started courting 'Adult Contemporary' territory. That's good territory if that's your intended audience. But there are fans who have hung around, clinging to hope that once Chris and the guys got this out of their system, they'd come back with material like what they delivered with ""Someone In Control"". And TRAPT has had a few of those types of songs here & there on various albums, just not consistently. ""Not So Different"" was about as rocking as this CD gets.

I really do understand that variety is the spice of life. I had high hopes for ""DNA"". I may be overly critical, but I refuse to spend $10 for music that just doesn't turn my ears on.",1471564800,2

87208,6803,18787,"Cane Hill became the butt of a cruel joke within my inner circle of music nerd bros. As the band released its first slew of singles after their signing with Rise we were convinced the band was merely a product of the ""hype machine."" The songs were structured well enough...but there was a youthful naivety in the vocals and the ""N-Metalcore"" delivery that just wasn't jelling. We mocked, we disliked, we moved on.

Then Smile happened.

Smile is the album this band needed to make. Taking all the influences hinted at on their ep and wearing them proudly on dirty sleeves (Slipknot, Korn, Marilyn Manson, AiC) while injecting the raw heaviness of their earlier, more -core leaning material resulted in an album that is extremely varied and revoltingly heavy in more ways than one. Sure, banger tracks like (The New) Jesus and the superb Fountain of Youth get the blood pumping and give off all the right Kornknot vibes. But these songs, along with the softer numbers (the haunting, radio friendly-ish You're So Wonderful; slow-burning album closer Strange Candy) are backed by well written and gritty lyrics.

""Naive and oh, so confident/we soak up blatant ignorance,"" is the line kicking off mggda, a fine piece of N-Metalcore with spacy guitars, provocative lyrics and sickly sonic experimentation. A good synopsis of what the band are at heart. (The New) Jesus has a strong Knot meets Manson vibe, the guitars churning and the drums lurching as the vocalist preaches a-la Corey Taylor, ""If Hell's a place, we're going there. I'll lead the way."" True Love & St. Veronica experiment with more subdued sounds, the latter especially sounding like what modern Korn SHOULD sound like.

Fountain of Youth, with its bare lyrics (""Everyone says that the good die young, but if I die young what will they say about me?"", ""Everyone said I could change, I could be saved, I could be a nice motherf####r"") and haptic guitar work is probably my favorite track on the album. The latter half of the album falls into a bit of a comfort zone, with Cream Pie, Ulgy Model Mannequin & Screwtape being retreads of previous concepts. But You're So Wonderful and Strange Candy keep things interesting in their sorrowful restraint, both songs showcasing the band's mastery of simple song craft.

Is this album technical? Hardly. Perfect? Far from it. Cane Hill is the kind of band that truly benefits from these limitations, coming out of the gate with a signature sound, intriguing lyricism and great structures in liu of any form of flashiness. This album is sickly. It's pissed off. It's toxic in all the right ways.

87254,12631,18793,"Throughout his life Ray Charles overcame obstacles that would defeat lesser men. He was partially blinded in an unfortunate accident in his back yard at age 5 and became totally blinded at the age of 7. Rather than wallow in his misfortune, a very young Ray Charles began to study classical piano and clarinet at the State School for Deaf and Blind Children in St. Augustine, FL. Ray quickly figured out that music was what he wanted to do with his life. He moved to Seattle in 1948 at the age of 18 and formed the Maxin Trio. Just a year later the group signed a recording contract with a small Los Angeles based label called Swingtime. After just a few months the groups debut release ""Confession Blues"" rose all the way to #2 on Billboard's R & B chart. A couple of other hits followed and important people in the music business began to take notice. One of them was Ahmet Ertegan of Atlantic records who had a knack for discovering important new talent. Ray Charles would ink a deal with Atlantic records in 1952 and the rest as they say is history. Over the next five and a half decades Ray Charles would become an institution and one of the most important recording artists and ""live"" performers in American musical history.

While Ray Charles was wildly popular among jazz and R & B afficianados during the 1950's he really hit his stride with general audiences after signing a deal with ABC-Paramount in 1960. There were certainly a lot of raised eyebrows when Ray opted to leave Atlantic but evidently he knew what he was doing. During his 14 year stay at ABC Ray Charles had around 60 charted singles and recorded dozens of successful albums in a wide variety of musical styles. Which brings us to his biggest hit single of all-time.

""I Can't Stop Loving You"" is a popular song written and composed by country singer, songwriter and musician Don Gibson, who first recorded it on December 30, 1957, for RCA Victor Records. It was released in 1958 as the B-side of ""Oh, Lonesome Me"", becoming a double-sided country hit single. Four years later in 1962 Ray Charles recorded his unforgettable version of this tune. It raced up the charts at breakneck speed and within just a few weeks was the #1 song in the land and remained at the top of the charts for 5 weeks. The song earned Charles a Grammy for ""Best R&B Record"" of 1962. This is Ray Charles at the absolute zenith of his long and incredibly successful career.",1471564800,5

87288,56,9725,"Hard to believe that it has been 7 years since Michael Jackson tragically lost his life. Musically, he was one of the most influential entertainers of all time. But after the 80's and early 90's, Michael was losing his seat from the throne, and in 2009, he passed away. But he had some of the most brilliant songs during his peak of his success, and that will never be taken away from what he left behind. When the pressure was on to follow-up the mammoth success of Thriller, Bad didn't have the sales success in the long run, but Michael still had the chart success and some of the most timeless songs of his career, in fact more timeless than even Thriller, Off The Wall, or what he had with his brothers in the Jackson 5. Man In The Mirror remains one of Michael's most riveting ballad of the 80's, that still has as much serious heart reflecting on the negative world around us, and how differences can be made for a better life for everyone. It still is one of Michael Jackson's deepest ballads that is worth listening to each and every time. If you have never even heard a Michael Jackson song before, well this is one I absolutely recommend.

About a week ago, it was this one, swinging to high heaven and adorned with the inimitable voice of Van. Some may complain about the string section (who needs it?) but I appreciate the ambition and musicianship, even if it would not have been my choice to include strings. The other ""volumes"" of this, released separately, are not as essential, but they round out the picture with alternate versions and a bunch of songs not included here. If you have none of these, start right here with Volume 1. This version of ""Listen to the Lion"" is tear-inducing. One technical note: There seems to be a splice near the end of ""Domino"" that is not pitch-corrected, and it sounds crazy when it hits.

87296,15928,18800,"This seems a bit more settled than the first two albums. I saw him performing the precursors to ""Roundabout"" and ""Funny Thing She Said"" when he was still touring ""Primrose Green"" last year, but I didn't imagine they'd be as pulled together and developed as they are now, while still maintaining the loose feel that they had when he was still fleshing them out. I miss the freneticism of ""Primrose Green"" and I miss the earthier subject matter and feel of ""All Kinds of You,"" but this album brings a smoothness that those two don't provide. I read a review that said that this album has ""improved' vocals over previous albums. Meh. It has more restrained vocals, which could in cases equate to the same thing. It's certainly more refined. This album is neither a step forward nor a step back, as I hold his back catalog in equally high regard. Think of it as a step into a different dimension.",1471651200,5

Radio rock is equally shallow as radio country, but I somehow learned to treat indie rock and classic rock differently. This was the album that changed that. I saw the buzz everywhere, one of my local NPR affiliates started playing ""24 Frames,"" and I realized that I'd typecast an entire musical movement for my whole life.

This album is a bit different from everything they have done thus far. It is a bit more mainstream and pop sounding with repetitive choursus and a full studio band sound to i lt than anything they have done yet.

I just don't happen to agree with those reviews. An artist ought to be able to mix things up. If they kept repeating a successful formula they'd get trashed for always sounding the same. They just can't please everyone, so in the immortal words of Ricky Nelson, ""ya gotta please yourself"". I'm sure Sarah did that and I'm pleased as well, especially with the sparseness and simplicity she employed on this CD.",1471651200,5

87311,1805,16967,"Anchor & Braille was Anberlin singer Stephen Christians side project.  With Anberlins parting Anchor & Braille is now his main stage to put out the tunes.  And these tunes are low-fi electronic vibes and don't possess the verve or even the melancholy that Anberlin could infuse into their best songs.  They are rather tame and uninspired almost-can-dance twirls.  Take it for what its worth.  Accept the syrupy sugary confections married to Christians higher-ranged vocals that have more of an emphasis on minor melodies rather than the aching, raw, or punctuated emotions he had previously put out.  I prefer the latter.  Though I did enjoy A&Bs last album, no doubt due to Copelands front man Aaron Marsh helping smooth out and punch up the music, this Late Night Drive doesnt leave me wanting more, it leaves me wanting something different, something that I know that Christian is capable of and has done before though isn't necessarily wanting to continue.  Songs For The Late Night Drive Home isn't bad, but its certainly not really good either.

That this album is a concept album doesn't matter to me one way or the other.  Even as a King Diamond fan (the king of metal concept), I rarely listen to metal to follow a story.  I listen for the songs...and this album is chock full of outstanding ""heavy melody"" songs.  If you like Amon Amarth or simply head crushing, catchy metal, this is for you.",1471651200,4

This is the first recording completely.,devoted to his piano music that I have found.  This is a stunning recording.  The sound quality and the passion and skill of the performer are first-rate.  There is a booklet included with detailed notes, as well.  The spirit of Armenia is the spirit of Komitas, and it shines through his music. I can highly recommend this recording.

I would also recommend the recording of his Armenian Divine Liturgy, an unaccompanied choral piece that is nothing short of transforming.",1471737600,5

This is a great song!

Guster made an effort here to grow; to change their sound; to up their game. We should applaud them for that. Not criticize.

The funny thing is ... they succeeded. The album is fun and breezy. It sounds like Guster, but also, a little like the Beach boys and other 60's pop. In a good way.

Buy this CD and listen to it a few times. It will become apparent that Guster created a strong, cohesive CD. A winner!",1471737600,5
87389,4899,11669,"Wheels of Fire is a religious theme for me in Martin Luther Stonehood. I was born less than ten years after the death of Freud, after the second world war, after atomic bombs and at a time of nuclear device testing. The theme of this song might be expanded to I was born under a look at the turds sexuality of spying in which religion became an inclusive protection agency that wants to shut America up. There might be some danger in speaking my mind, so I listen to what opeople sing. What I crave is a certain kind of woman to carry me to my grave. I've been down since I began to crawl because Plato's demography is not allowed to outsmart rulers, cops, soldiers, organized religion or twisted dreams of eating crumpets in chapter 44 of Hard Times by Charles Dickens because George Orwell thought Dickens was more entertaining than any political views based on reality.",1471737600,5

87394,15947,16531,"Joey Negro a/k/a Dave Lee has been a household name for anyone following quality dance floor music for more than 25 years. I remember buying releases on his Republic Records label in the late 80s though I was not a big house fan - but his involvement mean that it probably had an edge to make the tracks stand out from the rest. Seeing his name(s) in the remix credits on various labels always made it a must check this out during the weekly shopping trips. When he started Z Records the quality only improved further with releases under his various aliases (Doug Willis, Sunburst Band, etc. ) which usually made them mandatory purchases. As an avid collector and dance music historian he has also brought us several essential compilations on the label including Volume 1 Remixed With Love By Joey Negro three years ago which was a total joy. It made multi track edits available to a wider audience before other compilations like The Mike Maurro Peak-Hour Remixes or Message In The Music: The Ashley Beedle Re-Edits as well as Kon's numerous edits and a plethora of vinyl and digital bootlegs came out. When this, Volume 2, became available for pre-order I just reached for my credit card. The set arrived on the announced release date and it's been on rotation a few times now. The verdict: Its (almost all) quality and where I am not 100% convinced its usually the original itself, rather than Daves editing job, that leaves me cold. The vast majority on here is excellent and the whole thing is a Must Buy.

The O'Jays I Love Music (8:09) is a courageous choice as an opener: The track is a classic and at the same time, I sometimes feel tired of it when the original comes on. However, Joey strips the intro down to just vocals and organ before piano, keys and percussion join. The groove kicks in almost a minute and a half into the track and its a winner. Later a vocal break down and a vibes breakdown keep it interesting before a dubby last two minutes highlight the timeless nature of this Gamble & Huff production.

Patti LaBelles Music Is My Way Of Life (7:56) has a great structure, with percussion and funk-o-sizer building for over a minute before vocals and drums heat it all up to boiling point at the two minute mark when the bass-lead groove and the Skip Scarbprough arranged horns keep up the pressure. With The Waters siblings on background vocal duties, its a very soulful affair before leading into a second half with percussion breakdowns.

The Pockets Come Go With Me (7:36) is a quality Earth Wind & Fire related production from 1977 which to my knowledge never saw a 12 release. With the original seven inch clocking in less than four minutes and the album version just a tad longer the mere fact that this has been extended to almost eight minutes is great. But its the integrity of Dave Lees re-edit that makes it so special. I am sure Verdine White and Tom Tom 84 would approve.

There have been a number of remixes of Gwen McCraes classic Keep The Fire Burning (7:05) and some more respectful than others (DJ 2Three Rework on L.E.S.S. is good) but I wouldnt be surprised if Joeys new version becomes the new standard to play for DJs. The vocals remain a sing-a-long invitation as ever but the punchy groove is really updating it for Now, without running the risk of sounding out of date any time soon. You gotta ride it baby!

Initially I was sceptical, but give the next track about 90 seconds to build (or to be segued into a mix) and then you're on a ride you won't regret: Earl Young, the inventor of the disco shuffle drum pattern lays the foundation to The Trammps Can We Come Together (8:36) and Dave Lee makes it a Philly Dub Excursion  exactly as the remix name suggests. One big jam out of 212 North 12th Street, Philadelphia, PA which would surely get Tom Moultons nod of approval.

Joey Negro Jazzy Reprise (6:50) of George Bensons Love Ballad takes a really interesting approach. Of course we get the signature strings of this Tommy Lipuma production (almost a minute of ONLY the strings) before the rhythm section makes it clear that this is NOT a love ballad. Before verse or chorus we enjoy some Benson scatting and a piano solo which I do not remember from the original; I *think* this is one of Dave Lees tasteful overdubs. Time flies when you are having fun and the original song only starts at 3:40. Just beautiful.

Speaking of beautiful: Taste of Bitter Love (6:39) is just that with Gladys Knight top class vocals on top of a solid Ashford & Simpson composition. Though the original is quality, I don't recall this ever being a particularly collectable single and at first I almost thought of the remixed version to be just good, but not particularly outstanding and then comes the breakdown after four and a half minutes: When bass and drums just groove along before strings, piano and vocals come back in you're tempted to skip back to the beginning to enjoy it all over again.

Similarly, Open Your Mind (8:46) is just another one of soooo many quality Kleeer tracks, that even this re-edit stands the risk of being ignored amongst some of the other tracks on this release  which is not fair. For a more radical remix I will probably still occasionally spin the DJ 2Three Rework on L.E.S.S. but Dave Lees true-to-the-original mix is the kind of top drawer stuff that Woody Cunningham, Norman Durham and the rest of the band churned out seemingly effortlessly and which we don't get any more from current artists. (Note that there were two Kleeer tracks on Volume 1!)

Nicolette Larsons Lotta Love (6:38) is blue-eyed soul / yacht rock territory, which I am not too keen on. Original seven inches are dime-a-dozen but there is a collectible Jim Burgess 12that Joey Negros remix owes a lot to. We stay in similar territory with the last track on CD1: Robert Palmers Every Kinda People (7:26) is probably of interest to a certain demographic but you can remix this as much as you want, its just irrelevant background music for me.

Having said that, I should probably also skip the opener on CD2 but Christopher Cross Ride Like The Wind (7:56) has been a guilty pleasure of mine since I bought the single from my pocket money in 1979. Thanks for reworking this Dave!

The soulful power vocals of Thelma Houston belt out I'm Here Again (5:54) and its a high octane workout. This is superior to the original which started very softly and took two and a half minutes to become interesting (as well as becoming a rehash of Dont Leave Me This Way). The new version makes it a dancefloor stomper on par with the collectible Danny Krivit remix though Mr. K. had added some interesting percussion that would have also worked well on Joeys edit.

Speaking of which: For me, the original of Grace Jones anal anthem is all about Sly & Robbies drumnbass being interwoven with Sticky Thompsons percussion. Its such an underrated breakbeat that I posted a seven minute plus Pull Up To The Bumper Groove Version on Youtube a while ago in which I extended those parts (look it up on Youtube...). Dave Lees mix (7:45) takes it in a gimmicky disco direction including some vocal samples of Grace as an aerobic instructor. It doesnt work for me, but then the original is kinda holy to me.

All is forgiven with the next track: Cheryl Lynn You Saved My Day (8:56) is an update of the rare promo only 12 and it works sooo well: Simple and repetitive groove with Cheryls stunning vocals on top. Its well structured and doesnt become boring even at almost nine minutes.

Willie Hutch Brothers Gonna Work It Out (6:36) is a very important and still very relevant message track. Dave removed the long quiet intro of the original and you get the power drumming of the original straight from the start. Those drums won't be everybodys cup of tea and I would have preferred them to be replaced, to be honest. Kons version was interesting - look for it on Soundcloud.

Norman Connors Stella (6:26) has a much more relaxed feeling in the original; Daves remix starts off with a steam hammer drum programming reminiscent to but different from the original. Initially I found this a bit too much in your face but the jazzy soloing of the other players is preserved and it might as well reintroduce a new generation to Mr. Connors. As Dave Lee writes in the booklet: For him its about beefing up the tunes sonically and tweaking the arrangement to make them easier to program for todays DJs.

Next up, Jean Carn Time Waits For No One (6:39): Classic voice, originally written and produced by Whitehead / McFadden / Carstaphen. Id argue you cant go wrong with a track like this and I love to hear an edit of Was That All That Was which has so many ingredients that could be featured with access to the multitracks.

People might not recognise the name but many will be familiar with Loose Change Straight From The Heart. Originally produced by Tom Moulton its one of those tunes that has immediate Ohrwurm quality. Joey calls his rework the Straight To The Groove Mix (6:30) and it does what it says on the tin with the re-edit and additional production giving it up-to-date oomph.

The next mix is called Back To 81 Mix and stays true to the original of Don't You Want My Lovin' (7:15). Who cares that Wanda Waldens vocals and the melody is a bit poppy, this is just feel good dance floor music. The funky rhythm guitar will get people on the dancefloor in a set that features Nile Rodgers tracks and the Randy Jackson baseline still rides the good times vibe.

People's Choice Here We Go Again is very much in-you-face and a real Philly Stomp Mix (6:16). It works as a closer to this CD set though I am not sure where Id play this in the cause of a DJ set probably not at all. While I could do without this one and a few others, there is no way I could condense this compilation to just one disc.

Excellent value for money.",1471737600,4

87402,14818,18808,"The great Omar Binge Review Issue 1!

Wow - I'm incredibly excited - Omar Rodriguez Lopez has signed with Ipecac Recordings to release some of his large back catalogue of albums (yes, that is albums many times plural, not songs). The series will be running from July 15th 2016 up to December 16th 2016, essentially a new LP every two weeks. I'm a little behind in my reviews, although I've been listening to the first three releases already.

My initial thoughts were: if this is any indication of what is to come, I am going to be euphoric for almost six months. Let me say THANK YOU to Omar.

To me this album, which has a dark and pulsating 80s sound - totally catchy and accessible but nothing I'd call commercial really - is easily on par with the best At the Drive In Mars Volta albums. This is such a strong album right out of the gate for this series that I decided I absolutely HAD to buy and hear them all, even though at first it almost sounded comical to me that he was about to release so much material. This man is up there with the greats - Coltrane, Miles, Price, JB - where every cut has something to be savored on it, and what is best, the songs simply kick butt.

The singing is quite spectacular on this LP - and the glorious part is that it is, according to what I've found online, Omar singing on every cut. He has always been one of the greatest guitar players and songwriters of our time and he has really come into his own as a vocalist. He only works with top class musicians and here there are no exceptions to this, although you don't have as many spaced out moments of virtuosity - they're all to serve the songs - and it works marvelously. Deantoni Parks is on drums and even Teri Gender Bender shows up for some backing vocals. She makes me hope that at some point we get some Bosnian Rainbows tracks released on the series - or perhaps their album will drop soon (the wait hurts haha).

Isn't that insane? I'm so greedy - the man plans a TWELVE album release cycle and I'm over here hoping for more albums! I don't think it's because I'm greedy - it's because I'm addicted. And it isn't my fault. Buy this and JOIN ME!

This is the tentative release schedule below, everyone. Just board the train - and trust me, you won't regret it.

87438,15951,803,"There's a lot of more negative reviews for this album where listeners aren't quite sure what it is that bothers them. They just know it's different from previous output from Train and it's certainly a strong shift toward current mainstream trends in pop music-- comparisons to Maroon 5 abound, and not in a complimentary fashion.  And all of these things are true. But what surprises me is no one has seemed to pin down what's really missing here: the identifying Americana that has defined Train over two decades. What always made this band really stand out was how they could turn out perfectly radio-friendly tunes while having a distinct, rustic American sound, yet without ever being obviously ""country"" or ""southern rock"". It was an essential ingredient in all their albums up to and including Save Me, San Francisco, and was at least present through a good portion of California 37. But if the title-cut from that latter example, as well as aspects of its other cuts didn't at least hint that Train was enviously eyeing up the music popular among the club-going, Millennial demographic, this album dismally proclaims it from the highest mountain top.  To be fair, trying to stay current and update one's sound as a musician is not in itself a bad thing.  When it gets pitiful is when a musician starts sounding like he or she is just imitating what the younger artists have already done, as well as completely losing every trace of their individuality. And that is what is going on on Bulletproof Picasso, sadly.  It's too easy to get most of these tunes cunfused with every other pop band on the radio currently.  For example, the wordless crowd singing on ""Angel in Blue Jeans"". Ever since Philip Phillips, a plethora of artists feels the need to incorporate that into their songs to the point where it's becoming a gimmick-- even, disappointingly, the great U2.  Pat Monahan has stated that he always wanted Train to be a ""hip"" and ""cool"" band, feeling they were never in the mainstream enough, thus this album.  Then what the heck were ""Drops of Jupiter"", ""Calling All Angels"", ""When I Look to the Sky"", ""Marry Me"" and, oh, yeah, a little diddy called ""Hey, Soul Sister""?  Obscure minor hits?  No.  They are still heavily-played radio favorites to this day created with that unique Train Americana-- proving how unnecessary it is for Train or Pat Monahan to pointedly create corporate pop to sell well or be popular.  Now, that Americana, that simple charm, that rustic folk vibe has been brutally stripped away, with the exception of one or two gorgeous songs-- ""Son of a Prison Guard"" comes to mind-- in the name of being ""hip"" with the ""kids"".  Added to this, the only other original member, Jimmy Stafford, seems to have had very little to contribute to the record, although he was quite vocal in its promotion, making one wonder why this wasn't simply billed as the second Monahan solo album, which it basically is. In any event, whatever you credit it to, this certainly is not Train.",1471737600,2

87443,11543,18815,Good music.,1471737600,5
87444,307,2717,"This is definitely a decent album. But I've heard too much Bjork that is simply better or more creative to be honest. This isn't going to blow away many fans, and it's been done before in many ways. Bjork is one of the more original artists for sure. You can put a period after that. But let's not act like she makes all the music and plays all the instruments. Her team is pretty damn good at making something from not much.

Vulnicura offers almost nothing new, but rekindles parts and pieces of the last couple albums, even going back to the Homogenic era for instrumentation. But you will still hear Vespertine-like pieces mixed in even with some of the Medulla sound that made that album so creatively diverse. It comes together fairly well on many of the songs. Others just sound like random relationship problems put to disc with quality strings, and do not excite me or enliven my spirit in the slightest.

It's treading water long since refolded into various other more interesting works. This is just not as essential as anything going backwards from Medulla to Homogenic. The strings and instrumentation are good even gorgeous at times. The catatonic beats and collage atmosphere combined with the siren-like background singing has been done before and with more cohesion.

I like the lyrics in places. I also get tired of hearing ""I"" so much in these songs, even if it is a break-up album. I'm sorry Bjork but I'm not always interested in your personal life. I don't hate the album at all. But it's simply not memorable. This is an album that was put out to satisfy emotional demands coming directly from the artist. It's definitely something to hear once or twice, but beyond that I have no idea how to recommend it when there are 8 or so other better works by the same artist, a couple of which have many of the same characteristics.",1471737600,3

87497,12631,5032,"Stevie Wonder is amazing!!! During his nearly 40 years at Motown he produced some of the finest pop, soul and R&B records of the period. I cannot think of any other artist who does what Stevie does. He is a first rate singer/songwriter/multi-instrumentalist and producer. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame saw fit to make Stevie one of their earliest inductees way back in 1989.

Now during the 1960's Stevie Wonder made quite a few memorable records. You might recall his first big hit ""Fingertips - Pt 2"" which went all the way to the top of the charts in 1963! ""Little"" Stevie Wonder was just 12 years old when this tune was recorded and it quickly became obvious to all that this young man was a star in the making. One of my favorite Stevie Wonder discs was his rollicking 1966 hit ""Uptight (Everything's Alright)"". The tune peaked at number 3 on the Billboard Pop Singles chart in early 1966, at the same time reaching the top of the Billboard R&B Singles chart for five big weeks. Billboard ranked it as the 59th biggest American hit of 1966. The success of ""Uptight"" only reinforced the notion that Stevie Wonder was going to be a major player in popular music for many years to come.",1471824000,5

It's not much of a surprise I suppose since it's much more in the musical vein of his former band The Civil Wars which made great music together.  There's quite a bit of instrumentation on here that reminds me of their Barton Hollow album.  This album has good variety, and flows very well from beginning to end.  Nice to hear from JPW again although the music makes you kind of expect to hear Joy singing, but this has its own flavour too, most notably on the groove of Hope I Die.

87545,56,18194,"When it has came down to girl groups, there aren't really a whole lot of them that have lately delivered from the soul of the voice within. Musically, it has been much harder to see one that will ignite afire in the way that groups like En Vogue and Destiny's Child had been able to do the past few generations. When Fifth Harmony came out the past few years, I honestly was not very thrilled at the songs that they had been able too come out with in heart and soul. I was not excited of the songs Sledgehammer and Worth It, which showed the gals were not very strong at the soul, and sounded more like they were little children at the mike for the first time than divas at the heart. Their latest single from their second album 7/27, tries to bring in more of a reggae feeling to their songs, but it didn't work overall. All In My Head (Flex) their latest single, doesn't actually deliver at the heart of the matter to what they really could've deliver, as a more sultry and seductive song to turn to the kids, into sultry songstresses. I really was not very impressed with the song, and hopefully, when the gals grow further into their music, Fifth Harmony will have much more down the road to sing about.

A robust third, with an energetic finale to be certain.  Wand's Beethoven cycle burst through the scene in the mid-80's and was competition for the likes of Karajan, Bernstein and period instrument recordings popular at the time.  I've had his Beethoven and Schubert discs for years so just wanted to post a quick review - still a viable third, but not first choice, but enjoyable with a lean and rhythmic orchestra.",1471824000,5

87578,2537,17594,"Really enamored with this song. Feels like a warm-up before the bigger ""hit"" song comes out. What I like most about his new single is that is has a natural retro feel to it. Lloyd didn't come back trying to ingratiate himself with the new croud, yet. He could've easily did some hip-hop trap r&b music, rapping in auto tune, but he stayed in his lane and remained authentic. Has a mature feel to it. Looking forward to his new project.",1471824000,5
87579,3671,18822,"Been a huge fan of these guys for many years and I was sad to hear that their longtime regular lead singer had left the group. Needless to say, this album is simply okay for what it is but not the best in showing the true representation that Skeletonwitch can bring to the table. If you're already a diehard fan for these guys then you maybe cool with the change in singers but for me, it just isn't the same. One thing I will say about this album though, is that the instrumentation is great. The guitars and drums are all you expect from a Black Metal group. In terms of sound the band most certainly delivers but vocals can steer the album off track at points. I only recommend if you're open to change and if you're a diehard fan of Skeletonwitch.",1471824000,3

Gonzalez's voice is particularly dreamy in ""Yo Soy El Son""...beautiful song :-) ""La Vida Te Da Sorpresas"" is a trademark of Gonzalez's highly enjoyable renditions...this song had my foot tapping to keep pace with the infectious rhythm. ""Reflexion"" is a slow and luxurious track....lovely spoken voice here :-) ""Hay Negra"" has lovely percussion elements...this is a slow and easy song and just invites to sit back and relax :-) Likewise, ""Me Moriria"" is an immensely likeable song with a soothing touch to it.

The last song, The Resistance, is the best song on this whole album and in my opinion, one of Skillets best songs so far. Too bad more songs on this album couldn't be like this one instead of the electronic pop/rock style of two thirds of the rest of the album. Sounds like they are trying to please everyone and get hits on the radio, which just doesn't set well with me. Also, a lot of the lyrics are too simplistic and repetitive.",1471910400,3

Has alot of wonderful vocals from the film, 4 versions of the Ghostbusters Theme, including a rerecord of the original with Ray Parker Jr. That Is  almost indistinguishable from the one on my original Ghostbusters soundtrack. Avid Ghostbusters nuts like myself might notice a slight difference in the way Ray Parker Jr sings. But it's still pretty darn close. There are also versions by Pentatonix and Walk On The Moon (my favorite other than the original) and of Course the new Ghostbusters Theme by Fall Out Boy and Missy Elliot. I also really love some of the other tracks on here, including Girls Talk Boys, Party Up In Here, Get Ghost, and one of my personal favorite tracks on this new sound track, Good Girls.

""Storm feat.

The melodic notes of ""Helen's Song"" make this a very likable track. Marc Russo featured "" Now Is The Time"" is an awesome track...flawless and brilliantly played :-) ""Above The Fold"" goes at a fast clip and is a great song.....Kuehn's improvisations are wonderful in this one!

It seems a lot of modern music has forgotten that it can be fun and playful, or that not every song has to be a love song and/or a breakup song.  Sometimes you just want something nonsensical but fun and upbeat, with playful lyrics and an energetic electronic soundtrack to groove to.

The song itself is a power anthem, with a pounding beat and surging vocals set against a strong melody. The lyrics are about standing up for yourself and not taking anyone's nonsense.

Needless to say, this is a GREAT workout song, with the beat dropping out at certain points allowing for good changes in pacing. They even shout ""Go!"" at one point in the lyrics. Great motivator.",1471996800,5

87830,56,16206,"I have always loved George Michael musically, because he has been one of the most soulful singers I have ever enjoyed at the soul of the voice within. Which is something many of today's singers do not have and neither they will try. Hard to believe that it has been 35 years since he made his debut as a part of Wham, and his world really changed. But he has done so many remarkable covers over the years. He showed that throughout his career on his own by covering artists from Bonnie Raitt to Terence Trent D'Arby a few years ago for with Let Her Down Easy for his Symphonica album. But he has covered Stevie Wonder for years for so many of his albums and b-sides. His rendition of As with Mary J. Blige is one of those underrated covers that is really a hidden gem of George's. The song actually was a U.K. exclusive for his 1998 hits compilation, Ladies & Gentleman: The Best Of George Michael. The song is definitely a lovely song to listen to, and definitely worth every note. He really showed that he and Mary really do have a lot of chemistry worth listening to. It really was never recognized in America by die hard George Michael fans, as was the case with Outside back in 1998, but honestly the song definitely is joyous and very soulful. If you have loved George's duets over the years like Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me with Elton John, than you'll absolutely love this song.

87862,128,18846,"Its been twelve years since the hip-hop men of De La Soul released their last LP (The Grind Date, 2004) so it makes sense that they would require a Kickstarter campaign to fund their new works. And The Anonymous Nobody (Aug 26/AOI), their eighth and latest studio album as a full posse, serves all the great De La idiosyncrasies with some diversity of music and good guests for an all around solid retro-esque rap offering.

These aging De La Soul artists (Posdnuos, Dave and Maseo) are low-key in energy and volume most of the time, but their rhyme games are still respectably sharp. Its not bad that the general tone is warm. Platitudes and wise adages are sprinkled on their verses like the occasional gray hairs you might find on the authors scalps. The majority of the album is spent just kicking it it seems, as these legends casually toss their rhymes down with ease and skill. On their minds are past loves (Memory Of Us), the trappings of the fast glamorous busy life (Greyhounds), the problem with snooty people (Nosed Up) and hopes that we the people will go out into the world and do good (Exodus).

The production is right up there with the vocals in substance, befitting of the De La Soul brand. Highfalutin horns drape Royalty Capes, a variation of electro-funk brings the Pain, and Lord Intended is drawn out with firm rock guitar lines. A couple more joints (Drawn and Here In After) also feature those semi-extended swaths of instrumental music with cool controlled jazz featured in the last example and penultimate track.

Above all though, fans need to ask themselves if in this album there is the boundary-pushing and trend-setting of De Las early 1990s past. There really isnt, but they're also probably not trying to be cutting-edge also. In some parts, they're really not talking about anything out of the ordinary in particular, but they're also not causing harm with their words so it could be much worse. Its very comforting to hear the welcome sounds of De La Soul again no question. And The Anonymous Nobody is definitely not as middling or poor as a below average rating would suggest, but its also not wildly extraordinary. Overall we have a mediocre hip-hop album for the standards of these days and times, but the effort is very much appreciated.",1472169600,3

87882,12631,7573,"For those of us who were teenagers in the 1960's the news of the sudden passing of Davy Jones a few years back came as quite a shock. For a couple of years in the mid 1960's the group known as The Monkees was nothing short of a national phenomenon. Davy Jones, Peter Tork, Mickey Dolenz and Michael Nesmith became household names virtually overnight. Their debut single ""Last Train To Clarksville"" was released in September of 1966 and would go all the way to #1 on the Billboard charts. That very same month ""The Monkees"" TV show debuted on NBC and just a few weeks later ""The Monkees"" LP was released and would go on to top the national charts for 13 weeks! Producer Don Kirshner would spare no expense in providing quality material for his sensational new group. The Monkees would record tunes by such notable writers as Cynthia Weil and Barry Mann, Neil Diamond and Carole King and Gerry Coffin to name but a few. Meanwhile, Kirshner also employed a number of the top studio musicians of the day to help to make these records. Over the next couple of years The Monkees and Co. would boast a total of a half dozen Top Ten singles and four #1 albums.

By March 1968 The Monkees had already amassed an impressive total of 7 Top 20 hits including three #1 songs.  It was at this time that Colgems released their next single ""Valleri"".  In my opinion this was the most rockin' tune that The Monkees ever recorded.  Featuring the aforementioned Davy Jones on lead the song rocketed to #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 Singles chart.  But winds of change were in the air and the phenomenon that was The Monkees was coming to an end.  ""Valleri"" would be their final Top Ten record.",1472169600,4

87886,56,7202,"When it has came down to Coldplay, they have honestly been one of the most distinctive and melodic acts to have ever came out of the 2000 decade. Hard to believe that it has been over 15 years since Coldplay made their debut with Parachutes, and the songs that they have released have mostly been strong, uplifting and incredible. Chris Martin & company have not one group that has been tiring, they have just gotten better with age. But the past few years have been hard for the group. For Chris Martin, his marriage to Gwenyth Paltrow ended in divorce, but their music has not been as solid as what it was before. So lately, I have been going back to what made the guys from the U.K. so classy and distinctive from before. One of their bigger songs from 2005's X & Y, Fix You actually is one of those songs that really is melodic and brilliant. I early on liked the song, while I didn't find it as strong as The Scientist, Speed Of Sound or Clocks. But still, it is definitely a great song to listen to, and one of those gems that you should hear, if you have just gotten into Coldplay for the first time.

87897,3003,12421,"Electro-pop singer Ashley Nicolette Frangipane was born in Washington, New Jersey to a Black father and a White mother. The contrast in tastes of music (Her father: Hip hop, her mother; Alternative rock) would form the basis of who she is as an artist. Coming from humble beginnings, the singer watched as her parents struggled to make ends meet, as they were minors at the time of her birth. As a teenager, she became well versed in playing the violin as well as the acoustic guitar. However, she became a musician full time to make ends meet. She then chose the moniker Halsey, which was an alternate spelling of her first name and filmed doing cover songs on YouTube and posting original songs on Soundcloud. The latter gave her attention from record labels, to which she signed to the Virgin Records' alternative label Astralwerks Records - the same label responsible for The Chemical Brothers, Fatboy Slim and Empire Of The Sun. In 2014, she released her EP ""Room 93"" and went on tour with the British band The Kooks as an opening act. Almost a year after she released her EP, she released her debut album ""Badlands"" which featured production from the likes of Tim Anderson, Lido, The Futuristics, Swedish producer Yung Gud and the trio Captain Cuts, among others.

Musically, her album is rooted in the current sounds of edgy pop music with frequent nods to 80's indie. Thematically, the concept revolves around a fictional dystopian society called The Badlands - a desert wasteland where the survivors and natives were imprisoned. She begins the project with ""Castle"", where she enters a progressing society despite being chained. Halsey also tries to keep her head up admist the face of adversity and opposition on ""Hold Me Down"". On the first single ""New Americana"", she celebrates the diversity of the millennial generation, while working in a reference to Mtume's 1983 hit ""Juicy Fruit"". On the ballad ""Drive"", she speaks of a couple who have deep feelings for each other but are very careful not to make the first move and respond with silence. ""Hurricane"" is an autobiographical song that tells of her brief romance with an older man in her native New York during her teenage years. She finds an escape from her problems and desires to find happiness somewhere else on ""Roman Holiday"", while being done with an indifferent lover on ""Ghost"". She deals with someone on a path to self-destruction on ""Colors"" and continues the storyline on ""Coming Down"". Overall, ""Badlands"" is a good recording from Halsey. Although the production could have been a little better, in the end the songs are quite catchy and surprisingly upbeat for an indie pop act. Given the success of her debut, there may be a chance to hear more from her.",1472169600,4

87900,16001,17087,"Florence Foster Jenkins may not have been the pleasantest coloratura vocally, but at least her recorded output is mercifully short -- five of the old-style 78 r.p.m. records made the year of her death in 1944.  Since the middle 1950s these efforts have been readily available on LP and now CD, including this eponymous release from Sony classics, complete with EN-GER-FR booklet carefully describing Mme. Jenkins' singing ability without giving actual offense.  Certainly Ms. Jenkins did not shy away from the more challenging of better-known operatic vocals that provided coloraturas a great showcase for their talents.  Except for a ""color number"" written by accompanist Cosm&eacute; McMoon, the eight tracks of Jenkins lean toward standards like Adele's Laughing Song from DIE FLEDERMAUS, and ""Der Hoelle Rache"" from Mozart's MAGIC FLUTE.  Wikipedia describes the latter work as ""highly memorable, fast paced and menacingly grandiose.""  Indeed.  While La Jenkins' voice is not quite as horrible as portrayed by Meryl Streep in the 2016 biopic, it is menacing and grandiose enough that one cannot but wonder.

This disc also includes several Soprano/Baritone numbers sung by Jenny Williams and Thomas Burns and apparently recorded some time later.  While Burns is adept at communicating the kind of incompetence Florence Foster Jenkins was known for, Williams never quite reaches the heights of screechy soprano singing that a burlesque of this type demands.  Fortunately, the thirteenth and final track is an interview with none other than accompanist Cosm&eacute; McMoon, who, at some distance in time, is relaxed enough to recall that he, too, considered Jenkins' singing atrocious.  Guided by a highly sympathetic radio interviewer, McMoon passed on the nugget that when the audience at her concerts simply could not avoid breaking up, they'd cough or clap, adding to the pandemonium but diminishing the disrespect.  (This is portrayed faithfully in the movie.)  At this reasonable price, any lover of good music is well advised to stay far away despite the trilingual booklet.  However, those who love a farce somewhere between P.D.Q. Bach and outright camp will feel right at home here.",1472169600,4

I am writing a review for The Building Block 1.5 I hope you get something out of this review and with that lets get started.
I really enjoy this Album by Nehemiah, and I think you will too. It has great rapping nice beats and for the price it is an awesome deal.

87952,12301,18853,"Laying out an neo-psych album drenched in filtered sunlight thats interrupted by the occasional fluffy cloud, Morgan Delt moves with a sure-footedness I haven't experienced since Spacemen 3, delivering a outing filled with shimmering waves, solid arrangements, and layered with a dazed Sunday morning feel thats doesnt so much demand your attention; it's more that the record [red vinyl] ebbs and flows, creeping into your mind, into your spirit, into your frontal consciousness, where with an intricateness, he manages to step into the 21st Century creating an experience thats brightly lit, while riding on a breeze of all thats gone before him.  What he delivers, is a dose of psychedelia that harbors nothing but good vibrations.

""Phase Zero"" is an Indica stoners delight, presented with a mixture of  bright 60s British Invasion lyrics that are infused with the contemporary inspired west coast musicianship that instantly makes you aware that this album is designed to grow on you.

87953,5846,18846,"Holy s$%t - these sounds are good.

This is a slow burn. This is a lit fuse. This will be replayed into ages. There is a masterpiece in here.
This travels so many levels I can hardly see where they all are. Greyhounds is mesmerizing. Someone will get into track listings... I can't  - it's too damn much. Buy this album. You've not heard the like.",1472256000,5
87954,56,18854,"It is just so sad whenever someone young and talented dies very early, that you just get so moved from what they had left behind. In the case of underrated divas, there are very few and far between that have received that lack of credibility in sales like Phyllis Hyman. Hard to believe that it has been over twenty years since Phyllis had tragically committed suicide and died in her mid 40's, after spending years of not having real love or the recognition other divas have shown for years under the shadows that Clive Davis had recognized like the great Whitney Houston. Phyllis didn't get it in the way she should have and just died forever young but broken from the soul. When I think of all of the tracks Phyllis recorded during her beautiful and somberly short life, there were so many that showed she could swoon unlike no other diva in the way Meet Me On The Moon had shown. It is just one of those soulful jazz and midnight soul tracks that really showed how she was able to flex her heart, even when she couldn't get the radio airplay for everyone to hear her cries. It is just a lovely song that really delightfully displayed what Phyllis was really made of. If you have never heard a Phyllis Hyman song before, this is one I absolutely suggest you listen to.

87955,12631,7307,"The pop singer/actress Beverly Bremers is best known for her million-selling record, Dont Say You Dont Remember and her Top 40 hit, Were Free. Beverly has also starred in many theatrical productions, most notably, Hair and The Me Nobody Knows on Broadway, and The Rocky Horror Show and Menopause the Musical in Los Angeles. She has performed in clubs and concerts all over the world, as well as on talk/variety shows such as The Tonight Show, The Merv Griffin Show, The Mike Douglas Show, and American Bandstand.

In May 1971 Scepter records released ""Don't Say You Don't Remember"".  Deliberately styled to evoke the 1960's ""girl-group"" sound the tune peaked at #10 on Billboard's Easy Listening chart while just failing to cross over to the Billboard Hot 100 pop chart. In a rather unusual turn of events Scepter was about to release the follow-up single when ""Don't Say You Don't Remember"" belatedly became a local smash in San Jose with enough subsequent interest in other markets to debut at #98 on the Hot 100 in December 1971. The song would peak at #15 nationally in February 1972.  I loved this record the very first time I heard it and it continues to be one of my favorite singles from the 1970's.  Unfortunately as other reviewers have correctly pointed out this is NOT the original recording.  But as re-recordings go this one is pretty darn good.",1472256000,4

Excellent musicianship, mixed with the creative and socially-conscious lyrics we've come to expect.
If you dig Les Claypool, you should have this in your collection.
If you dig the Beatles, particularly their circa-1967 sound, this will blow your mind.

88115,7204,18867,"The song Auld Lang Syne has always meant so much to me as it represents a brand new start...it is not meant to be just about New Years Day in my opinion.  Not only do I love the music of this song during New Years, I love to listen to this version by Kenny G much more often. He hits the notes with so much heart and soul.

In my opinion, every single purchase that I made of Kenny G's music has been superb!
This particular instrumental music of Auld Lang Syne is the most mellow and soothing version that I have heard. Yes, I know that this is a New Years song, however because it is a Kenny G song and also instrumental version, I listen to it often, even after New Years. Why? Because it is a Kenny G song and so soothing and fantastic, this is why I love this song--anytime of the year!",1472428800,5

I'm 59 and still rock with the baby boomers era of the 60's and 70's , but this kind of music has grown on me because of TALENT, not popularity.

For those who wonder what's being said on repeat and cut out "" Roof is falling let me love me falling I just know, roof is falling let me love me ""

88189,2635,18785,"I went into this album expecting it to be as good as the self-titled, and what I got from this disc is typical Trapt. This is a band that needs to try a few different and more unique things other than just being the same band while having emotionless vocals and ""meh"" songwriting. But, considering vocalist Chris Taylor Brown is an egotistical idiot (last year was rough for Trapt, we will leave it at that), I will bet you they are aiming to be the same band for the rest of their career. I may purchase this album, just to have all of their albums since I do have an affinity for the self titled and ""No Apologies"", but I'm choosing to wait until this becomes a one-cent album from Round3 or Jukebox Online or something like that. Not worth the ten bucks.

88219,4505,16876,"I just got into Sturgill Simpson today after reading his rant against the Academy of Country Music over them stamping Merle Haggard's name over some award that has nothing to do with his legacy. First off, total agreement. Well said, Sturgill. The Hag would hat roughly 99% of all new country music because it's generic teeny bopper garbage.

Sturgill Simpson doesn't have that problem. This guy can flat out sing like a real county musician. His band has it's own sound and doesn't conform to any preset molds. It's not all steel guitars and such. He uses the sound of a small orchestration behind him to give his music a very unique property. His voice though is all country. I mean real country. Like George Straight / Waylon Jennings country. He's got twang in his tone without overdoing it to play into a role.

The first song on this album, Welcome To Earth, made me cry. I'm not a crier. I don't drop tears at every semi emotional moment in life. But I am a parent. And this song is all about welcoming your first child into the world and being overwhelmed with love so pure and so strong its like having your soul taken over. (If you're a parent, you understand) Simpson captures those emotions perfectly.

When you get to Keep It Between The Lines you hear VERY traditional country rock vocals set to a sort of 1970's soul band sound. It's a really cool mix that's working on every level!

If you want a true old school very traditional country sounding song both vocally and instrumentally, check out In Bloom. It's got what you need. Later in the album All Around You will take you where you need to go as well.

I had honestly never heard of Sturgill Simpson before today because I largely abandoned new country music over a decade ago due to it mostly...you know...sucking. As such I have just been out of sync with most new country acts. I can see why Nashville doesn't promote this guy heavily, because he's good. They seem to hate that lately. I'm not saying ALL modern country stinks. But the good artists these days are few and far between. And none of them are as good as the older generation of county singers. Sturgill Simpson belongs with that older crowd.",1472515200,5
88220,12631,7355,"In 1958 at the age of 18 a brash young singer/songwriter from Los Angeles named Phil Spector wrote a song called ""To Know Him Is To Love Him"". Together with three friends from high school Phil formed a group called The Teddy Bears and eventually recorded the song for the Dore label who released it as a single. Within months ""To Know Him Is To Love"" streaked to the top of the Billboard charts and remained there for three weeks. While he enjoyed performing Phil Spector's real ambition was to become a record producer. Phil moved to New York and honed his skills for a couple of years at the legendary Brill Building. While there he had a hand in making a half dozen hit records including the Ben E. King classic ""Spanish Harlem"".

Ben E. King was born in Henderson, NC and raised in Harlem. Ben had the great good fortune to work with the legendary vocal group The Moonglows while still in high school. He joined a doo-wop group called The Five Crowns in 1957 and they would become the new Drifters in 1959. Ben E. King can be heard singing lead on The Drifters classic ""There Goes My Baby"".

As a result of contract disputes with Drifters manager George Treadwell Ben E. King made the decision to leave the group in May 1960 to pursue a career as a solo act. It would prove to be an extremely wise decision. At the tail end of 1960 Atlantic released King's debut single on it's Atco subsidiary. ""Spanish Harlem"" would spend a total of 16 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 pop charts peaking at #10. The tune was co-written by Jerry Leiber and Phil Spector and produced by Leiber and Stoller. ""Spanish Harlem"" was ranked #358 on Rolling Stone's list of the ""500 Greatest Songs
of All-Time"".  This is the original hit recording.",1472515200,5

The track that mesmerizes me is the swaying ""Tengboche,"" a place in Nepal in the Himalayan Mountains with a breathtaking view.  Dennen's song is a driving track with a bass line almost borrowed from Johnny Cash, which makes this exotic locale seem like an exotic Paradise as Dennen sings, ""Meditated on a mountain.""

88238,482,17628,"I was so excited about this disc, put it in the changer, and was disappointed.  Each time I put it in the changer, I liked more things about it.  Until the 4th spin, wow!  I connected.  Blast off with me and ""Stranger to Stranger.""  I went through a period in my life when I was upsetting people because they didn't get my sense of humor.  Paul Simon's humor is like mine, very dry.  His lyrics abound in ironic twists like the opening of ""The Werewolf,"" ""Milwaukee man led a fairly decent life, made a fairly decent living, had a fairly decent wife; She killed him -- sushi knife; Now they're shopping for a fairly decent afterlife.""  Great irony there with a wry comment about the commercialization of religion.  The first single ""Wristband"" seems to parallel a scene from Michael Keaton's film ""Birdland"" where the star gets hassled about getting into his own event, remarkable for its throbbing rhythmic track, much like the ""Birdland"" soundtrack.  ""Proof of Love"" appeals to me with its melodic dirge and great acoustic guitar, ""The road is steep; The air is thin; I hear a voice inside my skin, ""Don't be afraid; Your days won't end with night; Feel the sun, drink the rain, let your body heal its pain, bathe beneath a waterfall of light.""  Lovely poetic images.  ""The Riverbank"" is the track that's been in my personal top ten this summer, entrancing me with its marriage of melody and lyric, ""Army dude, only son, nowhere to run, no one to turn to, he turns to the gun; It's a cross, it's a stone, It's a fragment of bone; It's a long walk home.""  ""Cool Papa Bell"" is a song about a Negro League baseball player which Simon laces with well-placed profanity.  On the deluxe edition, Simon closes the set with a duet with classic rock singer Dion on ""New York Is My Home.""  Gorgeous!  Paul Simon's ""Stranger to Stranger"" sits well within his body of work, fresh, laced with wry wit and inventive arrangements.  Enjoy!",1472515200,5

88255,3030,18846,"The problem with this De La Soul album is that there isn't enough De La Soul on it. Almost every song includes a guest vocalist and often those guests steal the show. The Memory ballad is all about the glossy vocals of Estelle. Drawn is literally a Yukimi Nagano song. Lord Intended becomes a Justin Hawkins solo before the halfway point. Its conceptually off-putting, odd even, how many bars go by with featured singers taking the place of the guys whose album this is supposed to be.

Its not like the songs are good enough to get away with it. Most are so-so. The rhapsodic changes of Snoopies; its not this but another song that features Snoop Dogg; is particularly jarring, though its worth mentioning that the Trainwreck beat, while amateurish, is quirky and cute. Its also worth mentioning that Exodus, an outro thats also an intro, could be something remarkable if its enchanting chorus and orchestration were developed into a proper song with actual rap verses.

I've seen trouble all my days
I bid farewell to ol' Kentucky
The place where I was born and raised.

For six long years I've been in trouble,
no pleasure here on earth I've found
For in this world, I'm bound to ramble,
I have no friends to help me now.

It's fair thee well, my old true lover,
I neer expect to see you again.
For I'm bound to ride that Northern Railroad,
perhaps I'll die upon this train

You can bury me in some deep valley,
For many years where I may lay.
And you may learn to love another
while I am sleeping in my grave.
(While he is sleeping in his grave)

My face youll never see no more

I'll meet you on Gods golden shore",1472515200,5

88264,7360,12421,"This album was recommended to me because I'm a fan of Zella Day and Meg Myers. I like their darker tones, the honesty in their lyrical content and just the overall depth of the music, and I was hoping and expecting much of the same from this. Musically, I have no complaints. It has a very good dark pop tone to it, great grooves, easy to get into. Vocally, again, sounds good, she has that dark tonal quality. My issue with the album is the lyrical content, it just seems hollow. The lyrics just seem very generic and not very personal at all. Many of the songs, including New Americana, and Strange Love, just have really generic and overdone meanings. Forget everyone, I'm better than them, I'm going to do what I want. Well high five, good for you.
Zella Day and Meg Myers actually feel like they are writing their music from experience. It's less about conveying a idea, and more about expressing their emotions through their past, and how they've learned to move on. They are songs people can listen to, and relate to, and apply to their own situations to hopefully find some healing in whatever difficulty they face. Halsey on the other hand neglects these things. While still ""dark pop"", the majority of songs are more about being the person you want to be and giving the finger to anyone who disagrees. This would be a fine sentiment, however, it has been so overused, and the message so abused that it is really just rendered repetitive and unoriginal.",1472515200,2

88292,7022,18881,"Many months ago I wrote the first Amazon review of the ""Birds of Chicago"" first cd. It was long after it had been released, I loved the music, and was shocked that there were no reviews. I just picked-up this new cd by them, and am really enjoying it as well. It is great to see that the word is finally out, and many folks are getting into this group. I noticed on the cd insert that the singer from the Carolina Chocolate Drops, Rhiannon Giddens, was both a musical contributor and a financial backer of this production. An amazing singer in her own right, and somewhat similar to Allison in sound and strength of voice, this speaks volumes of the artistry this group brings. The credits thank various folks for their help in financing the recording. Hopefully, these talented artists will have the success they deserve.

Among the reviews I noted one that surmised that ""big producers"" had manipulated the production to favor Allison Russell as the star and focus. Given the supporters of this production that seems an unlikely scenario, and I find the newest cd to be very consistent with the first one, Allison's voice just so outstanding and evocative, that it grabs your attention. With Rhiannon Giddens singing on the album as well, J.T. Nero's voice is a bit less prominent. Notice too that J.T. is the author of most of the tunes and lyrics. What is important is that this group gets it's due attention, and some financial success as well. That will hopefully enable them to create a lot of fine music with heart, for years to come.

I think the gentleness, sincerity, and humbleness that comes across listening to the Birds of Chicago is refreshing among the too numerous groups, stars of hip-hop and other current music, that focus on sexual dominance, being ""badass"", or are even violent in tone. Music is a venue to express many things in life, so to each his or her own - variety is a wonderful thing. But in a mean old world, it's nice to share a little tenderness, and the Birds of Chicago convey this in a gentle way, with depth as well. This isn't the Carpenters, it's music for adults, but kind.",1472515200,5

88319,56,18839,"It is sad whenever someone young and talented does not even come close to delivering at the soul of the voice, and instead falling by the wasteside. For Ariana Grande, she has been trying to mature into diva-hood like the ranks of divas from Mariah Carey to the great Whitney Houston (as her lackluster drive had shown on the ABC show Greatest Hits.) For Ariana, I was not very impressed with her lackluster songs already released from her Dangerous Woman album from Into You and Dangerous Woman. But also her song from last year, Focus didn't even shine her voice brighter, instead her voice sounded more shrill and putting too much emphasis on looking for herself, than a real voice. Her latest single, Let Me Love You, the third from her Dangerous Woman, isn't actually a striking duet. She and Lil' Wayne do not even have enough chemistry to sparkle on this track to shimmer as one of the more classic duets. Perhaps ariana has more growing up she has to do to make the heart firmly fonder. Maybe when she makes another record, it will work for her, but not now.

Notice that the song was gaining no traction whatsoever back in February, when it was first announced as a single and the remix was first released.

This album shows a variety of styles of music such as Hard Rock, Heavy Metal, Pop, Electronic, and Alternative. It's not their best work, but it is a solid album. I saw them at SoCal Harvest Crusades this past Saturday, and they did a good job of performing. It was my third time seeing them. First it was SoCal Harvest Crusades 2014, and the second time is Winter Jam 2015. God bless Skillet. :)",1472601600,4

88375,1348,15016,"Refused went out in such a brilliantly spectacular fashion that it almost seemed a shame when they got back together in 2012. Playing a series of shows that ended neither in a blaze of self-destructive glory or with the cops being called, it seemed as if Refused had been reincarnated as a functional, more focused and altogether different band. Perhaps cautious of tarnishing their perfect punk-rock legacy and iconic status, it took them three years (and the exit of guitarist Jon F. Brnnstrm) to produce new material. What once seemed inconceivable finally became a reality when the band let loose ""Freedom,"" their follow-up to 1998's landmark ""The Shape of Punk to Come"" and it was actually really pretty great!

From the opening notes of the blistering opener ""Elektra,"" the band sounds more than aware that half the people who bought tickets to their reunion shows and saw them perform at festivals the likes of Coachella only did so having a vague memory of seeing ""New Noise"" on MTV2 back in the late '90s. And they spend ten blistering tracks and nearly forty-five minutes spitting in they eye of any expectations that may arise from misconceived nostalgia. Produced by Nick Launay -- who has extensive credits ranging Semisonic to Killing Joke -- ""Freedom"" is heavy, catchy, dynamic and most importantly, concise. It's a sonic step away from ""The Shape"" and is all the better for it, for attempting to capture that sort of lightning in a bottle again would be a fool's errand.

So don't be surprised if ""Freedom"" doesn't quite align with what your expectation of modern day Refused should sound like. But don't be mistaken: it rocks, and it rocks hard. ""Dawkins Christ"" sounds informed by the likes of Slayer while ""Franafrique"" veers so close to arena-rock, its hookiness is almost sinful. Likewise, ""War on the Palaces"" is insanely, toe-tappingly catchy, melding the band's signature sound with much of the dance-punk that dominated the indie scene in the mid-2000s. Every now and then, the classic Refused will peek out from the foxhole. ""Old Friends/New Wars"" has that same sort of intensity that made their classic work so captivating and frontman's Dennis Lyxzn's delivery will send a chill down your spine as he screams frustration over being ""stuck in an uneven fight.""

 In that spirit, ""Freedom"" is itself stuck in an uneven fight, a war it cannot win. Against fans that may turn their noses up at the slickness or the adventurousness of it and against expectations that the band not muck up their legacy by delivering anything less than 10 brilliant bursts. The band walks a fine line and ""Freedom"" turns out to be one of the more rewarding listens of last year, and proof that although you can't always go home, there are always new trails to be blazed.",1472601600,5

88405,6842,18888,"From the opening chords of opening track - the old Temptations classic (I Know) Im Losing You you know that this is going to be a good un, featuring Kim Wilsons soulful vocals backed up by understated keyboards, the stinging steel guitar of guest Roosevelt Collier and Wes Watkins pounding drums, with occasional stabs of Wilsons blues harp.  Wow!  The album carries on in a similar vein, mixing soul and R&B, like on the version Eddie Floyds Ive Never Found a Girl (To Love Me Like You Do) and Paul Kellys Dont Burn Me - with Anson Funderburgh guesting on guitar.  Even Kims own song Smooth sounds like an old-style soul classic, whereas his song Meet Me On the Corner is pure blues - with just a nod to Junior Parkers Driving Wheel  and features wonderful Chicago-style harmonica swathed in reverb.

Kim is backed by a new version of the Thunderbirds featuring guitarist Johnny Moeller, bassist Steve Gomes, Kevin Anker on keyboards and drummer Rob Stupka, and if you think that they sound remarkably tight they all used to play in the band of Darrell Nulisch.  Im a sucker for Kims voice and his harmonica playing is still the best  bar none  but for me his recent albums, both with the Thunderbirds and solo, have slipped into a mid-tempo R&B mediocrity, which can occasionally ignite into something more exciting  like this albums (I Know) Im Losing You.  Everything here is very well-played but for me lacks the passion and fire of the Thunderbirds early albums and doesnt really provide the necessary platform to showcase Kims harmonica playing, although his singing is better than ever.",1472688000,4

88413,12631,10070,"Formed in Chicago in 1965 this U.S. soul-jazz instrumental group featuring Eldee Young (7 January 1936, Chicago, Illinois, USA; bass), Red Holt (b. Isaac Holt, 16 May 1932, Rosedale, Mississippi, USA; drums) and Hysear Don Walker (piano). Young and Holt both studied at Chicago's American Conservatory Of Music. They later joined the Ramsey Lewis Trio and were featured on two of the group's best-known singles, ""The 'In' Crowd"" and ""Hang On Sloopy"" (both 1965). Young and Holt then broke away and decided to form their own group which they dubbed Young Holt Trio. The act's debut single on Brunswick Records ""Wack Wack' was a modest national hit peaking at #40 on the Billboard Hot 100 in early 1967.

About a year later pianist Walker was replaced by Ken Chaney. Soon Chaney was out and the act was reconstituted as Young-Holt Unlimited.  Under that name the duo hit pay dirt with the million-selling instrumental ""Soulful Strut"". The song peaked at #3 on the pop charts in January of 1969 making it one of the most popular instrumentals of the decade.  This is the original hit recording,",1472688000,5

88418,13218,412,"I have adored this song for a long time...it always makes me feel empowered and uplifted, and has a way of instantly changing my mood if I'm feeling down. More than that, you can really feel the power of what Jill Scott is singing and stating via her voice and lyrics and ENERGY. What an inspiration!

The message is really basic - it doesn't matter what's going on in your life, if you live it like it is golden, it will be golden! I love this so much because I'm a disabled woman, living in poverty and I am also a soul singer. Due to my challenges, I've found it to be nearly impossible to make music, and not having a vehicle because of my financial situation has changed my life in ways I cannot explain. But you know what? I found a way to get to my R&B band rehearsal, and immersing myself in that music completely changed the way I've been feeling for so long - empty. I haven't felt golden in a long time, but as I approach an upcoming gig, I'm beginning to feel incredibly blessed.

I find that when I put out that attitude, when I work hard and don't give up, it is then I'm able to breakthrough from despair and I begin to feel joy again. This song is a part of the soundtrack that helps me to get out there and do my thing. Living my life like its golden means walking with my head held high, making the most of every day, celebrating the blessings of life. THANK YOU MISS SCOTT, YOU ARE A FIERCE TALENT!",1472688000,5

listening to this. People have compared this group to Dylan working with

88469,1438,17964,"I guess I am in the minority, I find this CD ""nice"" but a bit boring. Ironically
I was a huge fan of Lang and Case at the beginning of their careers,
both have lost that almost punk exuberance that they started with--although
both remain ""decent"" songwriters. Veirs on the other hand has evolved to
become perhaps the best female songwriter since Joni Mitchell's most creative
period, musically way ahead of her peers. Very few songs on this album are
in league with the best songs on Veirs' Warp & Weft album. I find myself not reaching
for this CD, even though I ""like"" it I lack the enthusiasm to listen to it often...",1472774400,3

Sarah Jarosz is an incredible talent with a unique and enthralling voice and all the chops to go with it.  Her previous CD's ""Song Up In Her Head,"" ""Follow Me Down,"" and ""Build Me Up From Bones"" all blew me away. This one is no different. Each is a treat.

88512,15913,18897,"This makes the second five star CD that a family member brought home for me today. Penny and Sparrow have more modern biting and sometimes nihilist lyrics which are put together in that classic 60's way that can't be explained only lived. They remind me of my favorite easy and slow songs of my favorite rock groups, both ancient and modern. (Simon and Garfunkel, Bonnie Prince Billy, Crosby Stills Nash & Young, Of Monsters and Men, Mumford and Sons, Don McLean, James Taylor, John Paul White come to mind as having songs of this style. In a nutshell if you liked Graham Nash's ""Our House"" you'll like this CD.)

I've been wondering about that rightness of fit between the singers and the band so I started looking at the studio musicians who flesh out the background and something jumped out at me. The studio guys are all over this generation's ""Muscle Shoals sound"" style music. There is a new genre of music emerging here and I'm predicting it will catch fire with the general public pretty soon. For instance Ben Tanner is credited as keyboardist on the album insert booklet.  Tanner has also done a lot of work for the Alabama Shakes, John Paul White, the Indie group The Bear, a list of others. Not just him, but reading the CD insert booklet you'll find names of lots of others who are deeply involved in the new Muscle Shoals sound.

(The one negative for this CD is that the above mentioned insert booklet is crap, white hand lettered print on dark paper. I'm a hundred and fifty years old so I can't read that sort of chicken scratching!)",1472774400,5

88520,56,17975,"These days with cover songs, unfortunately they are not even recognized at all. Unfortunately, most of the covers in the past several years have been jokes and not really as classy as the original songs have been. The past several years for R&B have been more of the overexposure of acts like Rihanna and Beyonce' Knowles. But for classic songs, they haven't really been shown the compassion and care that had been drove like songs did years ago. For Will Downing, he has been one of those R&B singers, known more for his concerts than even having a glance on the radio. But when he has sung a song, it is worth listening to. His cover of Cherelle & Alexander O' Neal's song Everything I Miss At Home definitely is a bright light, in a industry that has been more about flaunting the outers than the inner voice itself. It is a nice cover, and definitely ranks into the few that have been worth listening to the past few years like Musiq Soulchild's version of Maze's Silky Soul in 2010. It is a good song, and a treat for classic vintage R&B that is just missed in this industry today.

Song: B",1472774400,4

A record that would like everyone from fans of indie those who still dream of the return of that spirit the first album of Crosby. There is only one problem; the cover.

88666,12021,17323,"The energetic, charismatic Danger Danger frontman, Ted Poley, returns with his first solo record of new material since 2007s Smile, and he certainly delivers an album well worth the wait.

I will admit, I am a sucker for anything Poley sings. I love his voice, his energy and his obvious love for what he does, and having finally had the opportunity to see him live for the first time just a few short months ago. I have more respect for him and his music even more then before and I have been looking forward to this release since I first heard the rumblings that it may happen. I was not disappointed in the least.

With songs penned by the likes of folks like Joe Lynn Turner, Tony Bruno and Vegas Martin brothers and released by Frontiers Music srl, you know that song quality and production quality are top notch.

Then you have the band. We have Italian rocker and Hungryheart mastermind Mario Percudani on guitars. Hardline bassist Anna Portalupi on bass. Then add  to that an extremely talented man that seems to have a hand in almost every band out there at the moment, the great Alessandro Del Vecchio, on drums, keyboards and backing vocals. And of course the man behind the mic, Poley himself, sounding just as great as ever. If you didn't know better you would swear he could have recorded these songs the same time he did D2s debut album back in 1989, that is how superb the man still sounds here 27 years later.

So obviously there is no lack of talent on this record. And does it ever show as there is almost nothing to be found negative about the album, period.

While the songs were all written by others, the album is still a Poley record and he makes each song his very own. If you have enjoyed his other albums then you are bound to love this one. Delivering the best solo album we have ever had from him, Ted gives us a set of eleven perfect songs the way only he can do.

Starting things off right with a very strong track, the aptly titled Lets Start Something, before moving into an equally strong number, Everything We Are, it is quickly apparent we are in for a real musical treat with the record.

Without slowing down we head into track three and are given a song that most of us are likely already familiar with, the Joe Lynn Turner/Tony Bruno penned Hands Of Love taken from an extremely underrated classic of an album, Blonz 1990 self titled record.  Poley does a terrific job with the cover and stays true to the original while also giving it the Poley treatment.

The next track, The Perfect Crime, is a duet with Issa, who I am sure most of us are familiar with, if not then make sure to check out her music, a great voice with some fantastic albums. This ballad is one of the strongest tracks of the album and the two voices complement each other well with one of the best vocal deliveries of the record from Poley.

Stars is, in my opinion, the weakest track on the album. It is by no means a bad song, just lacking a little in the chorus. With that being said, it is still a great track.

Higher is another of the top moments in the record and is a fun, upbeat track with a fantastic chorus. Check out the link at the top of the page to see the music video and hear for yourself.

Where I Lost You and You Wont See Me Cryin are both great mid-tempo tracks that lead to another standout, the excellent track We Are Young.

The great upbeat track Sirens is next and that leads us to the final track the fantastic Beneath The Stars, which is yet another outstanding vocal from Ted.

The album is everything you could hope for in a Ted Poley release, or in a melodic rock release period. Outstanding musicians, excellent vocals and some pure melodic rock songs with great melodies and fantastic hooks.

How anyone could not like this genre of music is completely beyond me. In a fair world every one of these artists would be household names, selling millions of records and selling out arenas the world over. But for those of us who do know and appreciate the music, love it and breathe it, this is a record for us, melodic rock at its best. Do not hesitate to pick it up.

Highly recommended.",1472860800,5

88698,291,18285,"Karl Blau, a veteran deep-voiced, note-bending multi-instrumentalist from Washington State, and associate of Laura Veirs, receives a belated ""introduction"" on this remarkable album of stellar covers of excellent songs exclusively from the 1967-1975 time frame.

The masterpiece here is the exquisite, shimmering, wall-of-sound-ish ""Fallin' Rain,"" a generally neglected Link Wray record from 1971.  The stunningly layered production over nine and a half minutes, combined with Blau's magnificently soulful vocal interpretation, give this track an epic feel.  (Jim James of My Morning Jacket can be heard as a backing vocalist on this one.)

I enjoy the opening track, Tom T. Hall's ""That's How I Got to Memphis,"" nearly as much as the late Solomon Burke's 2006 version on his ""Nashville"" album (and that's a lot).  Country soul is a favorite musical hybrid of mine.  (This time it's Laura Veirs providing the very appealing backing vocals.)

Blau also takes on Tom T. Hall's 1969 country hit ""Homecoming,"" as well as a pair associated with Waylon Jennings: Bobby Bond's ""Six White Horses"" (originally by Henson Cargill in 1968) and the 1975 country hit, Allen Reynold's ""Dreaming My Dreams (With You).""  For a #1 country hit cover, Blau does a fine straightforward take on Don Gibson's ""Woman (Sensuous Woman)"" from 1972.

My favorite Bee Gees song has always been ""To Love Somebody,"" which they wrote in 1967 with Otis Redding in mind.  Otis didn't get to record it, but this country soul rendition by Blau is the best cover of the song I have heard since Memphis soul singer James Carr's in 1969.

Other excellent tracks (and I realize I will now be mentioning all ten!) are Layng Martine Jr.'s gorgeous and moving 1968 song ""Let the World Go By"" (beautifully sung by Blau; and superbly produced, as is the case for this whole album, by the songwriter's son, Tucker Martine); from the world of very personal singer-songwriter folk, Tom Rush's ""No Regrets"" from 1967; and Townes Van Zandt's warmly romantic ""If I Needed You"" from 1971, backed on vocals and guitar by Laura Veirs (married to Tucker Martine), who also did the stunning cover photography for this album.",1472860800,5

88700,12021,18915,"As the newest sensation making waves out of Sweden, this three man outfit came out of the gate hitting on all cylinders and delivered one of the best Scandi-rock records of the year, hands down.

With one EP already under their belts, 2013s three track Hard To Get, the band was signed to Frontiers in 2015 and the result was this outstanding record in the vein of bands such as Reckless Love.

The band themselves are some talented guys. Anton Joensson is an excellent guitar player as he proves here on every track, covering every guitar on the record. Dennis Butabi Borg is great as he keeps the bass line thundering along with both of the musicians complementing frontman Tony Anderssons fantastic vocals who sounds incredible on each song.

All of the guest musicians are great here as well, from the driving beats of session drummer Louisian Boltner to the piano of producer Erik Wiss to the backing vocals of Mattias Silfver, Martin Johansson and Patrik Noran, the guests contribute to making this album a winner.

The music is outstanding throughout the entire album. From the catchy Aim For The Head (click on the link near the top of the page to see the music video, if you like it you will love the entire album), Survive and Hard To Get to the more mid-tempo songs like Stay to the ballads like Straight From My Heart, this album does not disappoint as each track never fails to deliver some superb music.

This is the kind of record that keeps me excited about music. A young new band comes out, breathing new life into the genre, taking their place alongside the musical giants that have come before them and helping to keep this music alive. Not to discredit any of the older bands and artists or to say that their new music excites me any less, quite the opposite actually, but without new bands coming along then the genre would be destined to eventually die out so it is imperative that we have new bands such as this coming along, influenced by the older generation of bands and artists that have made this genre what it is today, and these guys do it right, and they flat out rock.

An absolute gem of an album with not a single bad track to be found. This is sure to please fans of bands such as the aforementioned Reckless Love and more modern Bai Bang. Scandi-rock at its best, it is definitely one you do not want to miss out on if you are fans of the genre.

88711,7472,18716,"one of the best albums the original line up made, it's criminal that this is out of print. The CD on the Netherlands label Flawed Gems is a needle drop of the original mono vinyl pressing. It's a pretty darn good pressing and whomever engineered this did a fine job of cleaning up most of the ue face noise without no nosing it to death.

The mono has never been released aside from the original pressings so this will be essential for fans of The Animals that have everything else they did on CD and this is a nice inexpensive way to get the mono release without having to pony up for an expensive copy.

The artwork replicates the original vinyl artwork and there's no notes on the making of the album so those looking for a bit of historical information on the making of the album will be disappointed.

There are 11 bonus tracks from the original line up and the Eric Burdon and The Animals line up that formed in 1967 from concert and BBC performances.

88730,128,18921,"Lets revisit an album that came out last weekend that needs some more attention. The new RZA joint that is a collaboration with musician and singer from band Interpol, Paul Banks, titled Anything But Words (Aug 26, Warner Bros) is a very good combination of rap and rock that does not dilute its hip-hop content really at all. Banks and RZAs relationship goes back to 2011 when they started recording together, and in fishing for new project-ideas later on, RZA could think of no one better to join forces with than Paul. The two, who draw their duo name from Paul Banks surname obviously with the last name of RZAs Bobby Steels moniker, have gone all in here. As it is a mix of genres but easily considered either hip-hop or alternative rock, Anything But Words might recall memories from the flavor-experimenting days of Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit, but this is better, more mature music, less loud and less in-your-face with better emcee craft and messages on RZAs part and strong enjoyable new-rock by Paul Banks, mastered and executive produced by both artists.

Paul provides most of the chorus vocals and main music production, but of course RZA probably helped enormously with the mixing and overall direction since hes such a talented established beatmaker himself. Through the lyrics and instrumental compositions, the two express their inner concerns, get out their worries and vent their grievances, as the guitars and drums screech out their battle cries and RZA vomits (in well made, well delivered rhyme lines) colorful streams of real world testaments and other testy talk. Bobby discusses growing up and deciding to become a better man in Wild Season, serves up one of his specialties, relationship struggles, in Love And War and gifts us with several inspirational moments and lines sprinkled elsewhere. Despite the fact that Anything But Words comes off the table of the major Warner Music Group, RZA has surprisingly been allowed to make more than a few statements that challenge the current establishment. These allowances he has fought for in the truth-spitting department are a bit astonishing but chalk it up to the RZArectors clout, experience and bargaining power when it comes to him getting his freedom of speech on these records.

The rock music is powerful and explosive and so is the rapping and singing. RZA is striking and Paul Banks is inspired and heartfelt. This pure product is a real powerhouse built by two impenetrable strongholds in the industry, two camps that can withstand any attack on them. For a more or less mainstream project of this nature, it is refreshing that Bobby Digital imparts all the knowledge and wisdom he does. The guy cannot make a poor project. Hes proven again that he is a true emcee and producer who has come such a very long way since his basic, early 1990s Prince Rakeem days. In proper form, its got Wu-Tang backing too, featuring Ghostface Killah, Method Man and Masta Killa as guests, the two other features being singer/songwriter Florence Welch and the highly credentialed Kool Keith. Big big props too go to Paul Banks, who has opened himself up to working outside of his usual mold and for sharing his skills and sounds with the hip-hop universe. Anything But Words: just a dope album by masters of their styles. Thank you guys.",1472947200,4

like a church choir; Gospel in fact.

for love is something that we adults look for
all the time. Yes, we want to know what LOVE is

was. Especially when we gave, & feel we didn't

grooves. I can't name everyone, but those were
the days of wonderful concerts here in Minnesota. The old Met Center, Civic Center,
& Northrop Auditorium.
Mark Ronson's arrangements are spot on.

CD that he had burned & had no other use
for, so he asked me if I'd like to have it.
Naturally without hesitation, I gratefully
accepted it.  I actually had no idea that this
tune was on it.
When I found it, I was very still when I listened.
A classic love song that reminds us that not only
women can feel abandoned or suspicious
of our beloved's actions.
There was a moment in a past relationship,
where I felt my heart was breaking due to
unsure feelings from my beloved.
It reminds me of what I heard from a beloved
character on Bonanza; Adam Cartwright.
He had reminded his Pa during a dilemma concerning love, of how easy &
less painful to tell the truth now, instead of
later. I feel that this song with it's melancholy
tone, can serve the same purpose.",1472947200,5

88846,874,2809,"Every Christmas there's at least a half dozen artists that release a holiday themed album. If you are fortunate to be on this earth, and have interest in buying new Christmas music, you might find yourself with a couple dozen Christmas albums.
It can be a reflection of an artist having a long career. Or if an artist doesn't  have a diverse discography, it may a pathway to get another album released.
Then there are artists that have reached a certain degree of popularity. Oftimes, there Christmas albums become perennial favorites like The Temperature, Johnny Mathis, The Supremes, Barbara Streisand and Mariah Carey. All the above listed artist' Christmas albums sell season after season. Luther Vandross ably joins this elite group.
Some of these artists perfect the genre and get to release several holiday albums over the length of their career. That includes The Temptations (3), Mariah Carey (2), Diana Ross (4), Natalie Cole (3), Barbara Streisand (2), etc. Luther now must be added to that list.
Several of these artists benefit with a popular television special like Diana Ross, Natalie Cole, Elvis Presley and also Mr. Vandross.
Luther's voice was perfect for Christmas as it is warm and he convincingly conveys his obvious love for the season.
He puts his stamp on classics like ""The Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire)"" and ""Have Yourself a Merry Christmas"". He also adds several new originals that one or more could become modern day classics.",1473033600,5

88895,3161,18432,"When Revocation first emerged on the metal scene, we knew something different was afoot, and that was the playing of leader/guitarist extraordinaire Dave Davidson, a musician of the calibre of the ultra greats.  Instead of relying on the usual bag of tricks most metal and death metal players use, Davidson threw in more curveballs than you could believe, with quirky choices of notes, delightful off kilter chord patterns and an innovative approach that got the attention of lots of people outside the metal realm.  Imagine Frank Zappa, Adrian Belew and other denizens of very precise yet unhinged playing.
  The new album ""Great Is Our Sin"" is, like the others, Revocation at their best, but there are some differences here that are worth pointing out.  First, the production seems to be a bit tighter, the guitar interplay a little more refined, making the riffs and hooks stand out a little better.  It still belts out the power but has become less cluttered.  The other is a few sections of clean and harmonizing vocals, a trend many death bands are starting to rediscover, and in this case, the clean vocals are such a welcome addition.  It makes those parts stand out like sore thumbs, especially the harmony parts.  I hope Revocation ditches the screaming all the way around because it will bring more attention to arrangements and hooks.  The whole schtick of grunting is getting old and my prediction is that there will be a fairly sizable reversion back to singing vocals.  It won't be complete, but it will happen.  ""Great Is Our Sin"" is a great metal album, fans of King Crimson and other experimental sounds will be interested, and if their cards are played right, this is the album that could propel Revocation into the big time without sacrificing their signature wackiness and heaviness doing it.",1473033600,5

88897,6407,12530,"""Last Song,"" by Edward Bear, is another of the 1970's songs which are melancholy and wistful and sad. Released in 1972 (same year as Bread's ""Diary,"" a similar sad song), ""Last Song"" spent 18 weeks on the charts and peaked at number 3 on Billboard's Hot 100. This was Edward Bear's most successful song; it centers on the singer's realization that his love, gone now for two years, is not coming back despite his keeping the lights on, hoping and longing for that return. Now, however, he understands that will not happen and so he writes and sings this ""last song"" for her. The time has come to close that chapter of his life, despite his continuing love for her. It's time to turn out the lights. A gently-sung piece, ""Last Song"" is entirely reminiscent of the feeling of the soft-rock 70's.

Edward Bear is not a person's name; it's actually a three-man band, named for Winnie the Pooh, whose actual name is Edward Bear. A Canadian group, Edward Bear started out in 1966, completely unknown and performed at events, birthday parties, bars -- eventually getting noticed almost by accident and signed by Capital Records. The members were Larry Evoy, architect/keyboardist Paul Weldon, and guitarist Danny Marks. The band lasted twelve years all told. They produced four albums and four solid hits. At the end, there were apparently no conflicts or issues among the trio; they just decided they were through with this segment of their lives and wanted to do other things.

In 1995, Evoy received an award from the Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada for ""Last Song"" (and two other pieces) having been played on-air 100,000 times. On soft-rock stations, ""Last Song"" is still played, 44 years after its initial release!",1473033600,5

88943,6407,7802,"A 70's hit, one of those melancholy sets which were not uncommon in that decade. ""Bread"" was a highly successful band which produced hit after hit, and their albums sold millions. Actual vinyl back then! ""Diary"" was written and produced by David Gates (Bread's keyboardist and vocalist), who was responsible for most of Bread's hits. Released in 1972, the song made it to #3 on Billboard's Easy Listening. It's a story, sung slowly and gently, from the singer's perspective. He discovers his wife's diary, reads it, and at first thinks the love expressed there is for him. As he examines things more closely, he discovers she's speaking of someone else, and his heart breaks. But his love for her is so great, he accepts this and, after an apparent unspoken divorce, he wishes for her and her new husband ""all the sweet things they can find."" The 1970's saw several such wrenching songs, but this one is among the best, musically and through its expression of selfless love. If you came of age in the 70's, and ever had a crush on someone only to lose her to another, this song will speak volumes. Bread's music generally was melodic and what we now call ""soft rock,"" although that term didn't exist back then.

Gates and Bread's other vocalist (and guitarist) James Griffin started out as good friends, and were the foundation of Bread, but as time went on friction developed between them because Griffin, also a writer, thought Gates's work was given more exposure and resentments built. Bread disbanded in 1973, but reunited in 1976. It didn't last, and Griffin left the band. Bread continued here and there, with little subsequent success, and is now only a fond memory.",1473033600,5

88958,56,17096,"It is very difficult to see an artist shine beyond the occasion than what they have already shown. For so much in R&B, it has been more of a lag with the sever overexposure of acts like Beyonce' Knowles and Rihanna, whom are more products than people and sadly not worth their money anymore. But for artists that are making their way into the spotlight like Andra Day, it is a bit more of a steeper climb, trying to be more than just a one hit wonder. What the expectations she has had trying to follow-up a distinctive song that really brought out her soul like Rise Up, it is a bit steeper than met the soul. Andra's latest single, Forever Mine, the second single from her debut album Cheers To The Fall, doesn't bring out more of the somber soul that really made her voice classy and distinctive. Here, she is sultry and strong at the heart, but I didn't find the song to flow in her harmony that same way she showed it with Rise Up. While Andra is a good singer to start, she could've had more for her song to follow, just like other unappreciated acts like Chrisette Michele or Deborah Cox. Hopefully, when her next single comes around, it can be more for the money.

88968,2191,17281,"Al Gromer Khan is a German-born author, sitar player and award-winning composer whos released a number of albums over the years, which span ambient, electronica and world fusion styles of music. Released on the Rasa Music label, Chakra Noir is essentially an ambient recording comprised of twelve compositions, which incorporate both Indian sitar and exotic percussion, as these elements are woven among intriguing electronic textures to create an overall freeform soundscape of understated elegance.

A Simple World with Flowers opens with muted and swathing percussion, as gentle sitar notes float among a metamorphosing and minimal soundscape of earthily warm layers, breezy ahhs and subtle textures. Setting the mood for the rest of the album, the compositions possess a characteristically low-fi nature, which lend themselves to understated melodies of gently evolving aural patterns. Continuing in this mode is Degrees of Tenderness, as it moves into drier territory with its twangy sitar, whistling effects and swishing beat that seem to collectively imbue the piece with a desert-like atmosphere. Shedding Light follows next with its muted rhythms, spacious notes and gently repeating guitar loop amidst beguiling suspended chords. One of my favorite pieces on the album, it perfectly exemplifies the often haunting and versatile backdrops that easily lend themselves to any number of visual and environmental interpretations. The title track, Chakra Noir, is another strong highlight that includes both sitar and female vocal snippets over a clicking, muffled beat. Here, delicate sparkling timbres provide a hazy ethereal quality to a composition that seems to move throughout the dimly-lit halls of some mysterious chamber. Rose of All My Days is another enchanting piece defined by shadowy tonal mists and an understated rhythm, which eventually concludes with gentle and dreamy sitar.

Perhaps what makes Chakra Noir most curiously appealing is the albums oddly-timed melodic and rhythmic signatures. Al Gromer Khan seems to have taken a rather improvisational approach in crafting these compositions, generally forgoing overtly predictable melodies in favor of more fluid and subtle sound structures. Vaporous tones evolve into variably ambiguous forms throughout their echoing passages, which can perhaps be best likened to that of watching passing clouds as they morph with continuity into variously familiar shapes. Especially well-suited for late-night listening, Chakra Noir is an alluring and innovative album that will likely find most appeal among fans of ambient and minimal music as well as experimental world fusion!",1473120000,5

88988,12631,9059,"It did not take long for The Doobie Brothers to make their mark on the American music scene. Formed in San Jose, Ca. in 1970, The Doobies found themselves riding high on the Billboard Top Pop Singles Chart when in the fall of 1972 their debut release ""Listen To The Music"" leaped all the way to #11. Quite an accomplishment! Over the next few years, in the waning days of Top 40 radio on the AM dial, the hits just kept on comin' with memorable songs like ""Long Train Runnin'"", ""Black Water"" and ""China Grove"". Meanwhile, The Doobie Brothers were also making their mark on the FM side. The album-oriented rock (AOR) format was just gaining traction in the early to mid 70's and Doobie's tunes were prominently featured in that format as well. What I particularly enjoyed about The Doobie Brothers was that no two songs seemed to sound alike. This was a very innovative group that featured tight harmonies and superior musicianship. The group was plagued by constant personnel changes which made the fact that their music was so consistently good all the more remarkable.

Then in 1975 Michael McDonald came aboard to replace Tom Johnston and lent his considerable talents to the group. But The Doobie Brothers had a lot of trouble coming up with another big hit. ""Takin' It To The Streets"" and ""It Keeps You Runnin'"" were great records but it seemed the public had lost some interest. In late 1978 the group released the album ""Minute By Minute"". This record was greeted with wild enthusiasm by the public. Not only did it reach #1 on the Billboard Albums chart, but it stayed there for five weeks. ""Minute By Minute"" also spawned the #1 single ""What A Fool Believes"" which in my opinion would rank among the best singles of the 1970's. What a fabulous tune!",1473120000,5

88990,11818,2826,"5-star songs are *typically* the only songs that make it into my library. With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.",1473120000,5

Its so fluid and enjoyable. songs like Baby Brother, Life Crisis and All Day All Night are great examples of their ability to take the listener in and through all sorts of musical wilderness. This album is tranquil and fast moving, powerful and airy. The violin/fiddle and percussive freedom reminded me very much of early dave matthews band. It actually might be a bit unfair to compare their sound to anything. Enjoy!",1473120000,5

89023,2180,1068,"You can certainly hear T-Bone Burnett's touches on this album, much as on Krauss/Plant's ""Raising Sand"" album. The homages to the Everly Brothers & other circa-1950s/1960s artists (even a little Peggy Lee) don't detract at all; there is enough original in the sisters' approach to make this album sand on its own merit. (e.g. The resemblance between Rattle My Bones and I Want Candy is not a problem) The song quality fades a bit toward the end of the album, but overall this a really good 'record'.",1473120000,5

89038,128,18950,"It was a long time coming for Port-au-Prince born, Montreal-raised producer, DJ and remixer Kaytranada, but he finally made it, thanks in great part to his XL Recordings-released debut LP 99.9% (May 6), a kaleidoscopic sample of where the rising talent has been, is and may be headed with his compositional arrangement skills. Louis Kevin Celestin by birth, Kaytranada has undergone a number of developments with his sound over the years, arriving on the scene now with matured artistic judgement as can be told from his inspired new style of low-key dance music in the album.

Light bass-laden vibes at the start clear up for more of the artist formerly known as Kaytradamus crafty electro-jams and IDM. Standard yet harmless topics await fans, but the plus is the diverse variety of features that are offered. A few rappers, including Vic Mensa, Phonte, and Goldlink fast rapping on the love-basted Together, experimental cutting edge bands BADBADNOTGOOD and Little Dragon, and singers from both distant and recent memory ensure that no two guests sound the same.

Kaytranada is versatile and never gets too comfortable in any one musical style, but he has no doubt carved out a spot for himself in the hearts of chill, groovy music-loving new-agers. You have to be a fan of purely instrumental tracks going in. Kaytranada is confident to the fullest in letting his creations shine all by themselves, though it also leaves a door open for hip-hop heads to be frustrated with the albums shortage of sixteen-measure, spoken word, rhyme verses, yet on the other hand its also not engineered to be a rap album. Still, 99.9% is appropriately titled since its a cool relaxing ride designed by and for real people, not the richest one tenth of one percent.",1473206400,3

89043,2664,18853,"2nd album from Los Angeles artistsweet, trippy psychedelic pop with oscillating textures and flittering soundwaves from visionary bong-dream worlds.  The music vibrates with the strange, wandering pop electricity of a cricket whos discovered the sound his legs make while dropping acid in the dream lounge of hallucinating angels.  Its pretty; its friendly; its somewhere else in the universe.  I do kind of like it, but it cant find a comfortable place to sit in my brain, and it rolls like a jelly-blob when I try to hold it.

89061,12631,17230,"It is a story that is all too familiar to those who have studied the early history of rock and roll. Greedy record label owners and executives would conspire to cheat artists out of the royalties they were entitled to. Not surprisingly during this period many black artists were victimized by this practice at labels like Herman Lubinsky's Savoy records in New Jersey and Syd Nathan's King records in Cincinnati. In the late 1950's, Berry Gordy Jr. had been bouncing around the record business trying to find his niche. Although he had written a couple of hits for Jackie Wilson Gordy quickly discovered that songwriting was really not all that lucrative. Berry Gordy Jr. had much bigger ambitions. He looked at the musical landscape in America and determined that there was a boatload of money to be made marketing black music to affluent white teenagers. And so with several hundred dollars of borrowed money Gordy founded Motown Records in Detroit. The year was 1960. He dubbed his modest recording studios in an old house in the Detroit suburbs ""Hitsville, USA"". Now there was a ton of talent in Detroit in those days and Berry Gordy was very adroit at recognizing it and getting these artists to sign with Motown.

One of the first acts signed by Berry Gordy Jr. was an R&B group from Detroit that called themselves The Miracles. Led by the gifted song writer and dynamic vocalist Smokey Robinson The Miracles would become one of Motown's most consistent hit makers. In December 1960 Motown released ""Shop Around"" on it's Tamla label. The song was an immediate success spending 16 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 peaking at #2. It was also the label's first #1 hit on the R&B chart. This is the original hit single you would remember from the radio.",1473206400,5

Grant played trumpet and drums in addition to piano, and studied at four music schools, after which he taught music himself, and then began performing in nightclubs while stationed in Texas during his army service. Grant signed with Decca Records in 1958 and reached #7 on the Billboard Hot 100 with his debut single ""(At) The End (Of A Rainbow)"".  The song received considerable airplay on beautiful music stations throughout the USA. This is a gorgeous record and Earl Grant would remind you an awful lot of Nat King Cole.

89225,3003,18373,"Malaysian singer Yunalis Zara'ai - or simply, Yuna - almost became a lawyer instead of a singer. She had dreams of wanting to have a recording career, but thought it might have been a little unrealistic. By the time she was ready to graduate from college, she started slowly taking an interest in having a music career. She recorded an EP and later signed through Fader Magazine's independent label imprint. Through that label, she released two albums: ""Decorate"" for her homeland and her self-titled debut for the English market in 2012. The album contained the Pharrell Williams produced single ""Live Your Life"", which got her enough recognition to appear on late night shows by Jimmy Kimmel and Conan O'Brien. She then signed with legendary jazz label Verve Records for the release of her major label debut ""Nocturnal"", which featured production from the  likes of Chad Hugo, Sa-Ra Creative Partners' Om'Mas Keith, Incubus guitarist Michael Eizenger and Robin Hannibal of the duo Quadron. Although she's long been a critical darling to most music fans, she had yet to secure a hit - which leads to her next recording.

In 2016, she released her third effort ""Chapters"". The record was primarily inspired by a breakup with her longtime boyfriend, who things went south with after their relocation to Los Angeles, California after Yuna wanted to further her music career. This time around, she makes a beeline toward the neo-soul audience with her sound while having production from Fisticuffs (best known for their work with Miguel), David Foster and the aforementioned Robin Hannibal. She begins the album with the indifference toward a significant other on ""Mannequin"". On the ballad ""Lanes"", she chastises a lover who would rather do hard partying instead of putting his relationship first. She collaborates with Usher on her breakthrough single ""Crush"" and duets with Jhene Aiko on the mid-tempo ballad ""Used to Love You"". She tries to deal with a man who's reluctant to settle down and enter a relationship on ""Unrequited Love"". Yuna also takes the reins by wanting to get serious about commitment on ""Best Love"" and gets reluctant to be in a relationship due to being hurt in the past on ""Too Close"". She tries to instill pride and self-esteem in a significant other on ""Best Of Me"" and makes an attempt to get through a breakup on ""Your Love"". Lastly, she closes the album with the ballad ""All I Do"" where she tries to put her best foot forward after the demise of a relationship. ""Chapters"" is a great album from Yuna that balances her artistry with broader commercial appeal. If she keeps on this path that she is currently heading towards, there is a good chance that she may become a household name and an even bigger star.",1473292800,5

89231,7360,18305,"Scour is the black metal project of the legendary Phil Anselmo along with members of Cattle Decapitation and Pig Destroyer. This was one of two projects I was excited to hear this year (the other being Sepentine Dominion with Corpsegrinder). First and foremost, just because you like Pantera and Down, does NOT guarantee you will like this album, it is very different from anything else you've heard from Phil. Musically it is very much a blackened death metal project, not unlike something along the lines of Behemoth. Vocally, I don't know that I've ever heard Phil growl like this. Sure, he did a lot of screaming and growling in Pantera, but nothing quite like the caliber of growling you witness him doing on this album. It's very dark, it's heavy, it's punishing, it is not for the faint of heart. It's everything I hoped it would be and more. Only 5 songs on the album, but I can say right now, this thing will be spinning for hours. Any of you interested in purchasing the vinyl, I HIGHLY recommend it, the sound quality is top notch, and it is well worth the price.",1473292800,5

89245,993,18971,"For those that know Nels Cline as an avant-garde guitar monster, the goal here is quality background music. Lovers combines original material and selections from the American songbook. The double album plays a variety of music as songs like Cry, Wait embody minimalism and tunes like Glad to be Unhappy are lush. Cline is accompanied by a large orchestra which partially consists of John Zorns downtown jazz musicians. As classy mood music, the performance and arrangements demonstrate enormous restraint. Never grabbing the bull by the horns, the group usually plays on the periphery. As a result, the music is understated and relaxingmostly. As on The Night Porter, there is some avant-noise; So Hard it Hurts is dark ambient music. Then again, Why Was I Born? channels old time jazz. Snare, Girl is wonderfully cinematic and Beautiful Love is as delightful as the title suggests. You Noticed channels noir as Lady Gabor reminds us of Bill Frisell. While descriptors like romance and mood suggest easy listening, this project takes effort to appreciate. Its strength isn't in expressing conventional sentiments of love, but rather how it crafts, with great originality, sonic textures and musical vignettes. While the title of the album announces the romantic theme, the mood is surprisingly low-key and dark. As the cover artwork suggests, this is a tragic romance that is most likely doomed. Knowing a romance is ephemeral doesn't make it any less powerful. Indeed, while Lovers is not a story with a happy ending, Nels Cline reminds us that some of the greatest love stories ever told were tragic.",1473292800,4

89304,4505,18979,"This might be an acquired taste. The vocals can be a bit high pitched at times, to the point where they really get your attention. My initial reaction was to dislike Adam Torres' vocals. But something kept me listening. As I continued to listen to this it grew on me.

The music behind him is beautiful. That's probably what kept me from turning it off in track 1. It's soft and soothing and just feels like the air around you. And the lyrics are VERY well composed. The entire album is magnificent poetry.

After track 2 the super high pitched notes subside a bit and the vocals are kept in a more reasonable range. And as the album progressed Torres' higher pitched voice became almost hypnotic.

I found the entire thing to be very soothing.

I particularly liked Morning Rain (Track 4) which I found to be a beautiful song in every way. There are some tracks that didn't work for me at all.

Daydream (Track 5) just didn't have the background music that worked for me.

Outlands (Track 6) took me to another place for 6 minutes. I literally felt removed my my environment and into the song. It was downright trippy and I liked it.

So there is a range of quality here.

I don't think everyone is going to like this album. But I do think everyone should give it a try at least into track 3. My initial reaction changed as the album went on. I ended up liking it overall.",1473379200,4

It took a band from Iceland to make a Rock and Roll album that defines what music is and why we love music so much. Love this band. No bad songs here, which what separates them from every other artist out there. They have set the bar so high, it will interesting to see their next effort. I'm always looking for something new music to embrace, love this artist so much, they make me remember why I've loved Rock and Roll since forever. Hands down the best album of 2016!",1473379200,5

89341,6253,18982,"Luscious music written for the silver screen as played by Valentina -- it lived up to what I hoped for.  First, the selection of romantic scores was generous and varied.  There are the old war horses like Warsaw Concerto, Cornish Rhapsody, and Dream of Olwen (which I played years ago in a student edition).  The other selections are exactly in the same vein.  I especially liked Track 7, Addinsell's Invocation.

Valentina plays idiomatically in whatever style of music she is playing.  This is not far removed from the more romantic side of Rachmaninoff, and she handles the playing with ease.  It sounds effortless for her.  Yet listen closely and you hear the same nuanced playing you find in her Chopin and Rachmaninoff.  She is very careful with her phrasing and keeping the structure of the work together.  That is a tough job which only the best can do.

So this should be a big seller for Decca.  It certainly delighted me.  (Note: I had to send mine back for a defective track 3.  I mention the specific track so that if you have a problem there, it might be a production error.  Hopefully it was just a one-off glitch.  And Amazon is so good about returns.)

If you ever get the chance, do see her in concert.  As good as CDs are, you still miss things you don't see in live performances.  I've seen her three times, and each time was a revelation.  She gives generously  long concerts, and before a live audience her playing is very emotional (yet always accurate -- I think I've heard one small fluff in three concerts).  I've also seen a lots of the greats - Gilels, Ashkenazy, Argerich to name a few -- and she is in the same pantheon.",1473379200,5

89345,1895,18984,"Cuban pianist Harold Lpez-Nussa, of a musical family, is well-versed in classical and jazz piano as well as with Cuban popular music. He played with the National Symphony Orchestra of Cuba, performed with Buena Vista Social Club artists, and won awards at Montreaux Jazz Festival. Here we hear his Latin jazz renditions of his own compositions and works by Thelonious Monk, Chucho Valds, uncle Ernn Lpez-Nussa, Aldo Lpez-Gaviln, and Miguel Nuez. Lpez-Nussa plays electronic keyboard, too, and has guest musicians on trumpet or flugelhorn, bass, percussion, and his father Ruy Francisco Lpez-Nussa  and brother Ruy Adrian Lpez-Nussa on drums. The music is beautiful and charming. Lobo's Cha, a son ballad, has a classical music feeling  Chopin comes to mind   but the music throughout the album, with its powerful rhythms, urge the listener to dance. One track, however, Inspiracin en Connecticut, is a mainstream, driving tour de force, and Oriente, with the bell-like ringing of water-filled glasses, is a gentle free jazz ballad. Some vocals are heard across the album, mainly as backing. The album itself is recorded and mixed in Havana with care, offering superb sound. Harold Lpez-Nussa is a master among the acoustic keys, offering a variety of tunes and arrangements. I can well understand why the audience at Montreaux honored him. This is an outstanding album. 54 minutes.",1473379200,5

89390,1805,15452,"A review in 3 parts:

Part I: Dream Theater has put out concept albums before.  Theyve put out double and triple albums.  They are a well-known and well-regarded group of gifted musicians with backing deals and monetary funds to help them put out products of excellence and ambition that lesser known bands simply cant compete against.  So then how can they put out a conceptual double album that fizzles out practically before it even gets started?  One of my favorite bands, a small little independent group called The Violet Burning, with a pittance of a following put out a conceptual triple album a few years ago (around the time that Green Day got some mild publicity for releasing three albums in three months if I recall correctly) that blew my socks off.  How could they pull that feat off but Dream Theater put out a wishy washy (dare I say wimpy) piece of fluff like this?  It boggles my mind.  I expect so so so much more from them.  Theyve got such a great catalog!  But not this.

Part II: The Astonishing is musically mild.  It is rarely heavy and hardly ever muscular.  Its melodies are underwhelming.  Youll find ambient and future-computer-code sounds, which are perhaps the most musically interesting tracks on the album, sprinkled throughout.  Youll hear a song that starts out like a Christmas tune (Im not kiddingcheck out A Savior In the Square) and I even had a moment listening to one of the tracks that made me recall The Carpenters of all bands!  What is this!?!  Dream Theater has thrown their chops around with ballads and even some close-to-standard rock songs but they usually stay close to the progressive metal sphere and love to let their collective hair down on epic tracks that take their time and take the listener on an adventure.  Theyve eschewed all of that this time around in favor of a wealth of short to average length songs that allow keyboard concepts to mostly take the leads.  Sure the guitar is there but it is almost always playing second fiddle to other elements of the song, or providing an additional melody.  If there are wild drum and bass excursions then Ive missed them amidst all of the songs trying to bewell, songs, that all add up to a story.  A hackneyed, dystopian future where a musical genius can be the savior story.  The packaging is pretty!  The interior booklet has some nice art in it!  But that cant make me like these songs.  There are a couple that pass muster but theres nothing that is anywhere near the greatness that Dream Theater can achieve.  I enjoy the feel good arena rockish anthem Our New World.  LaBrie sounds pretty good there and its rousing, but theres little else that generates serious interest.

Part III: Concepts albums may be harder to pull off than a regular release but in the end, just like regular releases, they have just as good a chance to be cool or to suck.  This one sucks.  It doesnt suck because of the production.  Productions fine, sound levels are paid attention to, arrangements while lacking the usual DT dynamic are still tight, and the musicianship is fine.  But it sucks because its boring.  And the story is linear, obvious, surface, and just boring.  Sure there are other concept albums that fail (check out, or better yet dont, P.O.D.s The Awakening) but there have been so many great ones.  DT has a few of their own with Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence being at the top of my list.  But what this album needed this time around to really help it out was different voices.  LaBrie carries the vocals and speaks for many different characters and because he cant make them distinct characters via his own voice he ends up hurting this release (it still wouldnt have been great even if they used other vocalists though).  I wonder if he remembered working on Ayreons The Human Equation and heard that fantastic end product, carried through by a variety of singers, to work out its concept exquisitely?  Did he ever think of doing the same?  Well never know.  Best to put this one behind us and move on.

When all is said and done one can listen to the album and not hate it.  You can find some different points of interest.  But I think that, as a whole, you're hard pressed to find that you enjoy the entirety.  I think most Dream Theater fans will be mightily disappointed and I don't see this making many new fans.  Not even of bands like Nightwish, Epica, Vanden Plas and others who play up offerings similar to this.  They at least do them up pretty well.  I want DT to go back and play their long songs.  2.5 stars of disappointment.",1473465600,2

Lady, for so many years I thought I'd never find you
You have come into my life and made me whole
Forever let me wake to see you each and every morning
Let me hear you whisper softly in my ear

In my eyes I see no one else but you
There's no other love like our love
And yes, oh yes, I'll always want you near me
I've waited for you for so long

I've seen trouble all my days
I bid farewell to ol' Kentucky
The place where I was born and raised.
For six long years I've been in trouble,
no pleasure here on earth I've found
For in this world, I'm bound to ramble,
I have no friends to help me now.
It's fair thee well, my old true lover,
I neer expect to see you again.
For I'm bound to ride that Northern Railroad,
perhaps I'll die upon this train
You can bury me in some deep valley,
For many years where I may lay.
And you may learn to love another
while I am sleeping in my grave.
(While he is sleeping in his grave)
Maybe your friends think I'm just a stranger
My face youll never see no more
But there is one promise that is given,
I'll meet you on Gods golden shore",1473465600,5

89455,2402,18997,"This album should not be confused with ELO Part 2, Bev Bevans brief continuation of the ELO project in 1990. Its actually the second album of Wood & Lynnes original Electric Light Orchestra, from which Roy Wood departed mid-recording, and was released in 1973 when Jeff Lynne had taken over as band leader, composer-in-chief and musical producer.

In addition to Lynne and Bevan, other musicians to survive from the early Wood-Lynne era are Richard Tandy on keyboards, Mike de Albuquerque on bass, violinist Wilfred Gibson and cellists Mike Edwards & Colin Walker.

The influence of Roy Wood is still felt on some of these numbers, notably the opener In Old England Town, Boogie number 2 and From the Sun to the World. The rest however lacks the quirkiness and distinctive style of the first 1971 album, is more like a 1970s prog-rock album and (sorry to offend dyed-in-the-wool ELO fans here) not among the very best of the genre. The problem is possibly that Lyne was intuitively after a bigger and more mainstream audience, but with a lot of undeveloped ideas from the early experimental time what we ended up with was possibly too much of a hybrid, unsure of where it belongs which falls, so to speak, between two stools: not really art-rock or experimental, nor a grab for a more mainstream audience with the memorable pop compositions which within a few short years would characterise the ELO sound.

Overall: after the quirky, eccentric and very original sound of the first Electric Light Orchestra album with Roy Wood in the driving seat, ELO2 is something of a let-down. To share this view depends, of course, on what floats your boat: if you like rock music from the 1970s spiced-up with cellos & violin, then this might be for you. Its an instructive pointer as to where the soon-to-be-an-international-supergroup ELO was headed, and interesting for all that.",1473465600,3

While you feel joy inside

This music has an unbelievable inner power. It stirs your soul from the very first moments because an inner joy and a strong desire to live to the fullest are contained in the sparkling guitar compositions of the new album Cielo Nocturno of Russ Hewitt.

The artist demonstrates all abilities of his talent of guitar playing. His music plunges you into the hot Summer days and exciting nights which are filled with unforgettable romantic moments. It helps you to feel joy and even delight from life. It isn't necessary to be worried about anything. You can easily realize that you were born free and your life depends only on you.  And you can find the source of your joy, it is hidden inside your soul. Just allow this music to come into your heart

The main theme of the album is undoubtedly North of Home which is mutual collaboration of Russ Hewitt and famous guitar legend Larry Carlton who very gently plays on a nylon string guitar and brings romanticism and refinement into the music of this composition.

Here I have to say that the company of masterful musicians has helped Russ Hewitt to record this outstanding project. Ardeshir Farah (Strunz and Farah) on Guitar, Walfredo Reyes Jr. (Santana, Steve Winwood, Chicago) on Drums, Raphael Padilla (Miami Sound Machine, Shakira)  Percussions, Bob Parr (Cher, Brian Setzer Orchestra) - Bass, Alfredo Caceres (Gipsy Kings All-Stars, Hamed Nikpay)  Guitar, Vladimir Kaliazine (Internatonal Recording Artist)  Accordion and, certainly, Larry Carlton - Guitar. All these true wizards together create an atmosphere of endless celebration and genuine fun. It is like old friends have finally met after a long parting.

What more can be said about this wonderful album? Listen to this very bright music. Let these vivid melodies heal your soul and fill it with light and optimism. Feel the joy of life and don't take all its disappointments close to the heart. Life is just a game. Go along it easily and freely with the amazing music of the album Cielo Nocturno.",1473465600,5

89469,5846,18999,"UPDATE: (1 week later)
I've listened to this album a ton and have to come back and edit my review. While the album is very good, it isn't a 5-star album. ""Gorilla Manor"" is a 5-star album, start to finish. I think I was just initially really happy to be engaged in their music once again, but we went back and listened to their first LP a couple times over the weekend and they just aren't in the same caliber. I feel like this one does reflect much of what I said initially (below) even still... It has an almost Foster the People vibe to it. If I could ask the Natives anything I'd beg them to return to heavy *band* arrangements - guitars, percussion, excellent and up-front drumming - it's the dichotomy of those elements and their soaring vocal melodies and harmonies over the top of it all that makes Gorilla Manner so truly special. Again - this album is very good and has several songs ('Past Lives' is a stand-out) and portions that hearken back to that sort of a arrangement, but it isn't quite the same. It will still be in rotation often though.

____________________________________________________

Original Review (day of release):

A return to form indeed. Sunlit Youth is the third full LP from these LA guys and it taps into the same sort of frenetic pool of energy that grabbed me from by the ears in 'Gorilla Manor', their first album, albeit this one applies that energy much more sparingly, lovingly, more sophisticated. While I listen occasionally to and appreciate their 2nd album, 'Hummingbird', it isn't one I put on often as it's far more subdued and introspective and in some ways heavy feeling. What I loved most about the Natives first album was the lyrical, thoughtful, harmony-filled and often soaring vocal melodies laid atop absolutely near-frantic 'percussiveness' in so many of the tracks. Overall I would say that this album, 'Sunlit Youth' truly does gather the strengths of the proceeding two albums and create something in-between that is depthful and will bear much repeated listening. It's also an album you can just put on and rock out to, which I don't feel Hummingbird was whatsoever.
If you love the first, but felt a bit let-down by the second album, you will recognize this third immediately as Local Natives, but years later, grown up, sophisticated. I won't go into track listings - someone else certainly will. But...

The reason this album [I bought the limited vinyl version locally] is getting 4-stars and not 3 from me is because of the vinyl production -- it is fantastic. It sounds legitimately better than the streaming tracks [I've also listened to the album in FLAC via Deezer Elite], which is often not the case. It is pressed on a beautiful and heavy clear piece of vinyl --- I generally do NOT at all like double-LP releases when not necessary, which I think is most of the time unless the album is very long. Just one, nice, heavy album that you just flip once - not three times - like has been done for decades upon decades, is far preferred to me and takes up less space on the shelf. The artwork is gorgeous and inventive, the jacket cover being a box-type to fit everything inside, but it still fits comfortably in a dust cover without any extra effort. It's been a long time since I was really impressed by an album's presentation - in some ways this reminded me of when I first open Pearl Jam's ""No Code"" 20 years ago... So yeah - the vinyl is awesome. Just like this album. Welcome back guys.",1473465600,4

Especially when they attempted to borrow some electronic soundscape and effects type stuff reminiscent of Aphex Twin, you knew the road would be bleak for a rock band to try to live in that space. And here it is. Yeah sure it's Radiohead, I suppose, only because Yorke's voice is there, but remove that and what do you have? Sounds like anybody out there, you have to be honest. This stuff is pass, but as I was saying, once you dip your feet into the soundscapes of Aphex Twin type electronic ambient and effects type stuff, you might just go there all the way and get rid of the singing. And you'll end up at Boards of Canada and that type of stuff, even The Orb, and then onto John Hopkins. I'm surprised people aren't tired of Yorke's whining. Takes energy to shake off this cloud, to go back to a more rocking sound away from the ambient laziness of this album. Lets see if they can.",1473552000,2

89532,16162,7314,"I was visiting Norway and I had purchased 4 of my favorite songs from the 1980s from Amazon Prime to listen to while I drove through the scenic roads of Northern Norway. Nena's 99 Luftballons was one my favorite songs and the English version was played on the local radio, though the song had special meaning to me because I took German in High School, and I heard the song in German. While I was driving through Norway's beautiful Lofoten Islands I came across 3 young Swiss backpackers hitch hiking along the side of the road. They had to get to Moskenes and hop on a ferry to get to Bodos (Norwegian mainland).

89569,7782,3796,"Empty Pages by Traffic is one of my favorites among many of their great songs and it stands up well to the passage of time.. This remix sounds a bit brighter than I recall from my old vinyl album (long worn out), but that may be some electronic wizardry reducing or eliminating the hiss, hum and noise inherent in the analog audio technology of the time. It retains the original feel for me and I think this remix is a success and (not all are!).

Empty Pages was one of the songs my the first 8-track tape I bought (a compilation of English rock). Back when I'd just gotten my driver's license and my first car this tape became my driving music and Empty Pages was particularly good in this role for me. At this time in the late 60's and early 70's when I was coming of age and playing guitar in a local rock band Traffic's music formed a kind of soundtrack to my memory of those days. So, I've got to admit I'm predisposed to love Traffic. I think Empty Pages or Glad (Both on John Barleycorn Must Die) are the best intro to Traffic for someone unfamiliar with the band.

Because it's such a great song with a successful remastering and it holds up so well over decades I'm giving Empty Pages a solid 5 stars.",1473552000,5

89588,16162,18216,"I was visiting Norway and I had purchased 4 of my favorite songs from the 1980s from Amazon Prime to listen to while I drove through the scenic roads of Northern Norway. Nena's 99 Luftballons was one my favorite songs and the English version was played on the local radio, though the song had special meaning to me because I took German in High School, and I heard the song in German. While I was driving through Norway's beautiful Lofoten Islands I came across 3 young Swiss backpackers hitch hiking along the side of the road. They had to get to Moskenes and hop on a ferry to get to Bodos (Norwegian mainland). Given the time of day, I realized I had to just drive them to the ferry terminal or they would have to camp in the cold Norwegian night. Along the drive the 3 Swiss students translated the German version of the Nena's 99 Luftballon into English for me. They were a Swiss German speakers so they did not fully understand what Nena was saying, but he German version is lot more interesting. The German version has nothing to with 99 red balloons.

89605,1463,17503,"With the release of her sophomore album, Life Sometimes, pianist/composer Sarah Dukes is beginning to find her place in the music world. While Sarah is a talented and experienced pianist, her primary role on this album is as a composer. As she evolved her craft, the compositions she was writing began to exceed even her own technical mastery. According to Sarah: I wanted to find a pianist who was able to play my songs exactly as I hear in my head-with the same emotion and interpretation. Yaron Gershovsky is the musical director of world famous pop vocal group The Manhattan Transfer, and is an unbelievable musician and pianist. Yaron performed the songs for this album as well as for her debut album, Finding Forever.

Right from the beginning of the opening track, I found Sarahs music to be moving and heartfelt. As she describes, I have learned that it is not necessarily perfection that others want, but rather genuineness and sincerity. I love how there are no words to limit the interpretations of the songs. Each listener is free to draw whatever messages he or she feels lay within the songs. I was particularly drawn to track 2 to for its title, Violet Beams. For me, this track evoked a yin yang mixture of melancholy as well as a sense of overcoming, from someone who has experienced something deep and life changing. Following this on a lighter note is a sparkly tune called Rainbows and Crystals, which reflects another facet of Sarahs musical spectrum.

Another song whose title intrigued me to hear how it was interpreted musically was An Angel Returns. In my minds eye, this composition evoked a vision of a heavenly being descending out of the clouds on a golden staircase. I listened to it a number of times in a row and with its soulful chord changes it was one of my favorites on the album. There are threads of spirituality and social consciousness woven through the tapestry of Sarahs music, such as in the albums closing track entitled One, which was inspired by a tragic event that brought people together. This song gave me chills the first time I heard it as it communicated the profound emotional depth of the experience it flows from.

Beyond all the beautiful music heard on this album, I had a deep appreciation for the spiritual awareness behind it. Life Sometimes is a gorgeous album that serves to further Sarah Dukes growing reputation as a composer of thoughtful and evocative music. Its hard for me to imagine having someone else perform such personal compositions and capture the nuances and feelings that went into the creation of them. However, Sarah seems to be more than pleased with the outstanding job Yaron Gershovsky has done in this regard. Together, he and Sarah make a wonderful creative team, and Ill look forward to more in the future.

89718,56,19019,"If there is one thing that I have adored about Phil Collins over the years, is that his songs with time and space have never gotten older, they've gotten better with time and age, like a fine glass of wine that has fermented into a deeper scent. 2016, has been a fantastic year celebrating his 35th anniversary since he had released his Face Value album.  But it also has been 30 years since Collins received the Grammy award for Album Of The Year for No Jacket Required. The songs on the album still definitely are more enjoyable than all the joke artists of today that haven't been able to shine in song and soul. One of my favorite songs from No Jacket Required, Take Me Home, still feels very soulful and deeply hit from the heart. It is one of those songs that definitely is underrated from Phil's legacy, but really worth the spirit. It always hits me like home from the soul, when I hear this song each and every time. It is one of his best songs from No Jacket Required that is worth listening to for anyone that is a die hard Phil Collins fan, or if you have never heard one of his pop hits from the past before. I absolutely recommend you get a listen to Take Me Home, and melt into the pop heart of Phil.

When I listen to the full cd, I was also happy to hear acouple more tracks that I listened to on YouTube and really liked, especially ""Immortal"" which is also a favorite of mine.

The 14 tracks here are like a soothing balm to the soul and have a never-changing, yet changing quality to them :-) Sisters is a touching track with a soft, uplifting quality to Landons piano performance.  Butterfly is a gently charming song and I especially liked the melody of this track. Shining Brightly is a gorgeous piece of composition with fantastic chord changes. This song is like a poem :-) Walking In the Light is quite inspiring and brings about an optimism in its glorious tune. Heart Song is an immensely likable track with a fantastic display of utterly alluring piano improvs..I adored this track :-) Transition has beautiful minor chords, that adds so much depth to this songLandons flowing fingers on the ivory create a magic in this song! Dark Nights has a melancholy at its depth which I found profoundly emotional :-) Beautiful! Another track that mesmerized me is Dancer, an almost visual track that I could picture in my mind. The intricate melody is perfectly matched with the steps of an imaginary dancer!  This album is a testimony of Landons talent for creating soundscapes with his piano that  are so very soulful, profound and at their heart, true to the purity of music :-) :-)",1473638400,5

Wolf, a re-telling of the famous fable is enchanting to see the least. The story-telling in this song kept me glued to it from the word go :-) I Cant Get To Sleep is a dreamy and compelling song, wonderfully rendered by Herron. Seduction is an exquisite song with its fantastic lyrics. I loved the guitar interludeso lovely! Notre Amour explodes with romance and caresses the senses.this is an ideal song for love :-). I loved the opening guitar bars in In a Heartbeat. Its a free-flowing track with Herrons melodious voice luring the listener to keep this song on loop :-) Another Dose of You is a classic love-song, a pacier number compared to the other songs here. Its a very memorable song with great melody and grooveloved it! After All the Time is a song from Herrons heart, a very introspective and somber song with great lyrics that convey a performers angst and wishes.  I Lie Just a little is a wonderful acoustic track with brilliant scatting vocals.great track!

89753,1108,19025,"I actually got hooked on ""Undertale"" earlier this year, thanks to a friend who gifted me the game and another friend who encouraged me to play it.  I fell in love with what looked to be a simple fanmade ""Earthbound"" tribute, but turned out to be a marvelously constructed game that not only parodied and deconstructed classic tropes of RPGs and video games in general, but delivered a story full of twists and turns, memorable characters, and some genuinely emotional moments.  The fact that the game was created almost entirely by one person adds to my admiration, and I find myself loving just about everything about this game.  (Well, maybe save some of the crazier fanart...)

One of the things that makes this game so memorable, however, is its musical score.  Composed by the game's designer, it's not only delightful to listen to on its own, but it marvelously accompanies the story of the game and its most iconic moments.  A good soundtrack will have memorable tracks, but a GREAT soundtrack, whether for an epic movie or an indie video game, will fit its story like a glove, providing atmosphere and immersion to the story and bringing to mind iconic scenes as one listens.  ""Undertale"" falls into this latter category, and its electronic music reminiscent of the Nintendo/Super Nintendo era of games fits the retro look of the game perfectly, a mix of ""bit-tunes"" and more traditional instrumentation and even some haunting vocals (yes, there are some vocals, if only in wordless choral bits in tracks such as ""ASGORE"" and ""Battle Against a True Hero"").

As another reviewer has pointed out, there are some recurring motifs that crop up in the game here and there -- most notably ""Once Upon a Time,"" ""Ghost Dance,"" ""Dogsong,"" and ""Memory.""  Some might call this a lazy recycling of the same handful of tunes, but in my opinion it simply helps tie the soundtrack together.  With such a wide array of tracks it could have been easy to create a disjointed mess of a soundtrack, but having recurring melodies and motifs throughout helps the entire soundtrack flow and feel organically connected.

Favorite numbers for this reviewer include ""Hopes and Dreams,"" ""MEGALOVANIA,"" ""Spear of Justice,"" ""Memory,""  ""Death By Glamour,"" ""Undertale,"" ""Battle Against a True Hero,"" ""ASGORE,"" and ""Reunited.""  I also enjoy ""Bonetrousle,"" ""Spider Dance,"" ""Ghost Dance,"" ""Metal Crusher,"" ""It's Raining Somewhere Else,"" ""Save the World,"" and the various level/location themes (""Snowdin,"" ""Quiet Water,"" ""Waterfall,"" and ""Another Medium"").  Some of the songs (""Dogbass,"" ""Danger Mystery,"" ""Oh My,"" and ""Bergentruckung"") are incredibly short, mostly because they're made to match short but important scenes in the game, but they're still worth listening to -- and might even make nice ringtones.

While those who have played ""Undertale"" will probably appreciate the soundtrack best (it's only ten bucks, go to Steam and play it if you're a fan of RPGs, or games in general), the soundtrack is still delightful to listen to on its own, especially if you're a fan of retro-style video game music.  It's a fantastic collection of music, and well worth the price.",1473724800,5

89842,10648,18436,"Paul Avgerinos creates pastels on the minds canvas with his musicthe visual impact of his songs is such that one just has to close his eyes to get transported to a different plane listening to his albums. Avgerinos love for Amma comes across loud and clear with this album. Just as in his previous works, this too showcase Avgerinos depth of feeling for music. Dhyana Shloka is lovely beginning of this serene journey with lovely guitar strums accompanying his vocals. Ananda Ma has great vocal harmony and the rhythm is lovely :-) I absolutely loved All Is Bliss with fantastic vocals and simple, heartfelt lyrics. The percussive element in this song is very, very nicely done with a wonderful chorus-line. The universal message of love and peace come across powerfully with Where There is Love , Avgerinos voice is magical in this song :-) Lokah builds wonderful images in the mind with beautiful vocals and a gently flowing melodyloved this track! Ammas Child is a charming lullaby and the love shines through in this song; this is the power of Avgerinos devotion towards Mata Amritanandamayi :-) Shivo Hum is deep, dark and powerful, like the Hindu God the shloka is dedicated toI loved the chants and the strains of the tanpura that runs through the track. This album is packed to the brim with Avgerinos multi-faceted talent as a composer,instrumentalist and singer; the high production value and masterful arrangements are the mark of a true genius :-) :-) :-)",1473724800,5

I usually walk around a bit and then go back to bed between 30 minutes to an hour and I have used this recording to try and fall asleep again many times.

89863,3871,19035,"This review is for the 180 gram LP.  The audio quality is exactly as it was in the film, with the intentionally harsh upper midrange in the strings that was designed to increase the tension and suspense in the minds of the viewer as the story unfolded.  The sound here should not have been like either of the composers two re-recordings of his score, because then, it would not have sounded like the ""original soundtrack"" that it is.  The audio is in original mono, just as it was in 1960 when the film was released.  Doxy's pressing of the album on audiophile quality virgin vinyl is exceptionally good, with no detectable surface noise at all.  I chose the LP over the CD believing that since this was a 1960 analog recording, any flaws in the master tapes would have been more obvious on digital media.  Incidentally, Universal released the score from the film on separate audio tracks of a LaserDisc box set (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Signature-Collection-Psycho/dp/B007VOMJPC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Signature Collection: Psycho</a>), and it is undoubtedly from there that Doxy remastered the recordings.  A close inspection of the back of the LaserDisc's box indicates that the score appears on an isolated analog track of the disc (which I own).  If you want to hear the original soundtrack of the film just the way it appeared in the film, this LP is for you, unless you prefer the CD, but I emphasize that it's the real thing and not some recently re-recorded clone of Bernard Herrmann's score.",1473811200,5

89873,12631,4862,"Matthew Wilder is an American musician, composer and record producer best known for his 1984 smash single ""Break My Stride"".  During the 1970's Wilder was one-half of the Greenwich Village folk group Matthew & Peter.  Then in 1978 he made the move to Los Angeles to follow his dream. Wilder found work as a backing vocalist for both Rickie Lee Jones and Bette Midler. Towards the end of 1983 Wilder released his debut album ""I Don't Speak the Language"".  The first single from that album was that bouncy little number ""Break My Stride"".  The song was a Top 10 hit not only in America but also in the UK, Ireland, South Africa, Germany, New Zealand, Austria, Sweden, Belgium and Denmark.  It is always a joy to hear this extremely uplifting tune!",1473811200,5

I spent so much money collecting their hard to get (in the US) vinyl and of course their Zaba release, I feel cheated.  I played this probably at least ten times front to back and I cannot like it.  It's pop.  It's incoherent.  It's not dark and moody and deep like Zaba.  Most bands, no matter how much they change or sell out, you can still tell that they are the band who they claim to be, this is SO FAR off base that they should have just changed their name, in fact, that's what most bands do, Nine Inch Nails side project?

89909,384,17786,"This album is not amazing, but it's not terrible either. But then again, it's Fitz and the Tantrums, so don't expect too much. The guy is not that great a singer, so he uses a lot of autotune. The girl who sings along with him is good, at least. And this album isn't very rockin', either. Even though this is generally a pop band, they have had some elements of rock. I didn't hear a single guitar on this album. But one thing I did like about this album is the first four songs. They're very good for dance parties, as they are very fun tracks. Really, you can't go wrong with Handclap, Complicated, Burn it Down (which is also the name of a Linkin Park and Awolnation song), and Roll-up, right? But after that, the album kind of falls apart. There's nothing too great about the rest of the album, but it's not as danceable as it started out. There's nothing wrong with songs like Walking Target, but what emotional impact are songs like that supposed to be giving me? I liked this album at first, and I still like the rest of it, but then I realized that it's kind of underwhelming. If you like Fitz and the Tantrums, you should probably get More than Just a Dream. Only get this album if you like the first four songs. The rest, eh...",1473811200,3

89938,3577,11116,"While this disk is being made to look like a lot of the radio broadcasts that are floating around, this is actually a major label release from Shout Factory, and while I suspect it was from a radio show, you would think that there would be more to it.  This performance is very short, about 35 minutes, and most of the early hits are here, This was recorded around the time of the first album, and it is great to hear the original band playing.  But with only about 6 songs on the disk, Be careful that you don't over pay for this one.",1473897600,4

89943,4505,491,"The vocals on this album are hypnotic. I mean that in a very good way! Considering who the Pistol Annies are that shouldn't come as a shock. But when they harmonize it creates something better than the three of them individually.

Most people are probably most familiar with Miranda Lambert of the three. If you like her solo work, then you'll find you like the Pistol Annies too. The songs have that same general ""I'm a strong independent woman who does what I feel like and I don't consider consequences"" theme.

The lyrics are butt kicking. The sound is awesome. It's just good music.

It's true country music. Not the junk you find on modern country radio. Lemon Drop (Track 2)  sounds like it was written in 1962, and that's not a bad thing. Bad Example (Track 4) has that same old timey sound but modern lyrics. Fun lyrics!!!

There are some slow sweat songs. There are some fast fun songs. There's a little bit of everything.",1473897600,5

90008,11962,19053,"This is by far Zeppelin's best ""official"" live recordings that are available. Though the audio quality may be better in How the West Was Won, the band sounds its best in these earlier live recordings. Plant's powerful, gritty blues/rock vocals are at their absolute best here, as is Page's masterful guitar play. The absolute best versions of Stairway, Since I've Been Loving You, Dazed and Confused, Black Dog, Heartbreaker, How Many More Times, Thank You, etc. are all contained within The BBC Sessions. If you already own the original 2 disc release, you may or may not want to shell out the money for the one disc of new material. I lost my original copy, so I was more than happy to buy this on its release date, because these live recordings have long been my favorite. The tracks are all remastered, but honestly I found little to no difference compared to the older copy. If anything, it seemed the guitar was a bit louder and Plant's vocals maybe a little quieter than before. But not a HUGE difference from the original. Of course, I don't have the two versions to compare side-to-side, so that opinion is strictly from memory. This collection is FAR better than the Sound Remains the Same recordings, and I prefer it over How the West Was Won (though that is also a fantastic collection of live recordings). If you want early Zep in their rawest, most powerful, most skillful form, then look no further than The Complete BBC Sessions. Other earlier live recordings of the band I recommend would be the Osaka Japan recordings and Blueberry Hill (both are bootlegs and unofficial material).

I purchased this album at a local Meijer store the morning of release. So despite not having a ""verified purchase"" tagged to this review, I can assure you I did in fact purchase the product.",1473984000,5

90010,4297,19053,"Well, I thought Jimmy Page said the Led Zeppelin re-master series was finished with Coda, but here we are. This time, the BBC Sessions album gets the deluxe re-issue treatment. As with the others, it includes previously unreleased material, in this case mostly from 1969. It includes the first official release of the song Sunshine Woman and a total of eight unreleased tracks (two versions of Communication Breakdown, two versions of What Is and What Should Never Be, Dazed and Confused, White Summer, I Can't Quit You Baby, and You Shook Me round out the third disc). If you already own the 2-CD version, you're basically paying for that third disc, along with the re-mastering of the first two. Or, if you're just a completist, to have all of the new deluxe editions. I'm glad to have it, and I'm glad Jimmy made it worthwhile by adding almost an entire disc of previously unreleased tracks. The packaging is in the same cardboard format as the other re-releases, with a really nice glossy booklet. The sound is typically excellent, having been personally produced by Page himself. Led Zeppelin was one of the best live rock bands ever, and this is a nice document of that fact.",1473984000,5

90012,4339,10555,"The title of the song is based upon advice given to the lead singer, by a female he met, 'long years ago.'  The advice is, that, when it comes to female relationships, that a man should 'Hold On Loosely' female, but that he should not hold on too tight, or he'll 'lose control' of the situation!  Good advice that should be considered as one wanders through the obstacle course(s) of life.  Right?  Right.  Basically, the advice is this, 'Give your baby a little 'spank' on the toosh reminding her that you are paying attention to her actions, and that you care, and are aware that other men might be interested, and that you have a 'potential' for some jealousy should a situation arise - but just a little 'spank' - just reminding her that you're the man.  If you try to actually control her - she'll 'SPANK' you back 100 times harder than you could ever handle!  So, the advice, from a woman, for the benefit of man, is to just 'Hold On Loosely' - and she'll continue to 'play along' and let you 'think' that you're in control!

Advice.

Everyone's got it.

Just by my first listen of its lead single, ""Life Itself"" I could tell. So many of these songs sound like the trendy straight forward Indie-pop tunes that have dominated Alternative music for the past couple years now. If you're hoping for the trippy psychedelic sound that was going on with their debut album, ""Zaba"" then you may be pretty disappointed. Not that this record completely abandons the psychedelic sound 100%, as it appears in small cases such as the song ""Youth"" but you can tell the band was trying to head in a new direction with this album. For what it's trying to be, I would say this album is okay but it's nothing that is going to blow anyone away, especially if you're hoping for more of what was going on with their first album.",1473984000,3

This album is yet another proof of that genius. Oracle has an ethereal flute that drowns the mind in sensation :-) Butterfly is an iridescent, brilliantly patterned song, much like the wonderful creature its named after. This track left me utterly relaxed and dreamy. Morning Light is hushed, brightening gradually.the softness of the flute is amazing! :-) The World Beyond is like an exotic journey far away from the every day life. The strains of tanpura are a lovely touch here :-) Back to the Heart got me thinking of deep rain drenched forests and the myriad sounds of natures bounty of teeming life. I absolutely loved this one! Traveling is rather an inner journey of the soulan introspective look at our very existence :-) Another track that caught my fancy is Moonrise, a fairy-tale like trackthe delicacy of the sounds are mind-blowing, I can see the fat, full moon rising above the tree line ; this is an ultimate relaxation track!! Transcendental reaches beyond the conscious mind to delve into the inner universe of the mind.

It's the only real full vocal mix here, as the other two are very close to dub versions, with minimal vocals from the original song.  The beats to Offer's mix of ""Say It To Me"" are very similar to his remix of ""Pop Kids""  I'm picking up the CD single of ""Say It To Me"" for the club mix of ""Inner Sanctum"", which was previously only on vinyl.",1473984000,3

90189,4505,15872,"If you're offended by anything (I'm looking at you, Generation Snowflake) don't bother with this album. You'll just hate it and come here crying that you've been the victim of a hate crime or something. Then you'll claim more micro aggression when everyone with a sense of humor tells you to piss off. So save us both the trouble and skip this. Go to you support group for ""People who got looked at weird one time"" instead.

Don't expect Grammy nominations. Not just because the Grammy people wouldn't know good music if it sat on their face and passed gas. But because this is definitely not meant to be taken seriously. Think of this as Waylon Jennings meets Andrew Dice Clay meets Weird Al Yankovic.

It's the dirtiest album ever. I mean you can't find gansta rap albums that are more filthy to the core. But it's funny!!!!! Family Tree (Track 3)  LITERALLY made me laugh so hard I cried.

The music itself is actually pretty decent old school style country. It's got a real twang and everything. If you take out the lyrics you'd think you were in a 1972 honkytonk. When you add the lyrics back in you get more of a modern day high school locker room feeling. I sometimes like to quote lyrics in an album review to give an idea of the quality of the wordsmithing. Unfortunately here, Amazon's review system has a profanity filter and I literally can't find 4 consecutive words on the ENTIRE ALBUM that I can type here without getting this review caught in the filter.

However, the mastering of this edition could have been better. I bought my set and it had a sticker on the front of the CD ""Made in West Germany"". Come on, it could have been better folks. Some of the lesser known tracks here sound like they were taken from LP source and not a great one at that. If you really want a good US best of collection of this band's songs, I would probably get ""FOREVER GOLD"".

90257,3202,17241,"I remember Radiohead emerging with ""Creep"" at the height of the grunge music movement 1991-1995 in 1993. I didn't think anything of the song, or of the band. But, in 1995, things shifted for me. Grunge had slowly been making its way into my music collection, and I was more open to its sounds. When Radiohead released ""The Bends"" with the singles ""High and Dry"" and ""Street Spirit (Fade Out)"", I began to re-evaluate the band. Their videos had begun to catch my attention as well. I gave ""The Bends"" a good, solid listening to, and in the end I had to admit that the band was showing musical promise which would later be confirmed on their next album, 1997's ""OK Computer"".

So, basically, for all intents and purposes, you could argue that I have been a fan of Radiohead's music since 1995. I own all of their albums, but I've never seen them in concert. I'm by no means an uber-fan, just someone who appreciates what they have done over the past 23 years.

""A Moon Shaped Pool"" is solid. Good in every way. I don't think it's a classic by any measure, but the band is continuing to show experimentation and originality in their approach to music making, and that's what any fan wants. Let's not go stagnant, right?

I, of course, have my favorites here like ""Burn the Witch"" with its Psycho-like strings, ""Daydreaming"" with its, well, daydream-like vibe, ""Ful Stop"" with its electronica, ""Identikit"", again with it's electronica, ""The Numbers"", ""Present Tense"", ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Sailor Rich Man Poor Man Beggar Man Thief"" and the very melancholy and moving closing track ""True Love Waits"".

I don't think Radiohead has made a weak album. They take their time between albums, ensuring things are not rushed. At the same time, they don't hit the pitfall of Peter Gabriel which is to stew on an album, tinkering, until perfection, thus running the risk of a stale album (see Peter Gabriel's 2002 ""Up"").

The band continue to surprise and inspire with ""A Moon Shaped Pool"", continuing to do things their way, at their pace, without much record label interference. This is the way music should be done, at the artist's behest. I have slick produced, manufactured music in my collection, and it's never as interesting as what an independent artist like Radiohead does.

Here's how ""A Moon Shaped Pool"" compares with Radiohead's previous works:

1993 Pablo Honey: Three and a Half Stars
1995 The Bends: Four and a Half Stars
1997 OK Computer: Five Stars
2000 Kid A: Five Stars
2001 Amnesiac: Four Stars
2003 Hail To The Thief: Four Stars
2006 (Thom Yorke) The Eraser: Three and a Half Stars
2007 In Rainbows: Four Stars
2011 The King Of Limbs: Four Stars
2016 A Moon Shaped Pool: Four Stars",1474070400,4

90260,15657,7792,"I Love this song. I'm a Preschool teacher and my mornings can be pretty hectic. Parents, students, and other teachers all play a part in the hectic mornings. When my classroom starts to become a little too stressful for my students (parents talking on cell phones while dropping off their crying child, other students fighting, etc). I just turn on my Bluetooth Speaker and when this song comes on the calming effect over my room is amazing. I've noticed others have mentioned the audio quality of this song does not match the CD version. I have no audio issues with this track and no matter how many times I play it this song will never become old. I love the message and the voice delivering it.

90280,7599,19053,"Originally released In 1997 as a two cd set the ""Led Zeppelin BBC Sessions"" included raw recordings from the band's first four albums. The performances for the most part are outstanding. There's lots of improvising on these songs especially with Jimmy Page's soloing on his Gibson Les Paul. He truly is an amazing guitarist. On this 2016 release which is now a three cd set and remastered by Jimmy Page you now get an extra disc of unreleased material such as ""Sunshine Woman"" and ""White Summer"". Sound quality wise I didn't find a huge improvement over the 1997 version of these BBC recordings. Comparing the two I just didn't find much to get excited about sound wise. Many of these recordings are in mono and I suppose Jimmy Page really couldn't do much to improve them. If you already own the 1997 version of ""Led Zeppelin BBC Recordings"" you probably won't want to shell out close to twenty dollars for the third disc. Die hard Led Zeppelin fans (like me) will want to purchase this set now called ""The Complete BBC Recordings"".",1474070400,4

90301,524,19079,"""Daydream"" is the debut album from pianist/composer Emily Rowe. Five of the ten tracks are solo piano, three are piano and cello duets with Tina Guo, and two are trios for piano, cello, and violin (Michelle Jade). All of the music was composed and arranged by Ms. Rowe and all of the pieces are graceful and soulful - great music to study with, for background music, to get lost in while unwinding, and to listen to for pure musical pleasure. There are no flashy piano theatrics here - just beautifully realized heart-songs that are played with grace and artistry by all three musicians. Rowe cites classical music (especially Chopin, Debussy, Mozart, Bach, Beethoven and Schubert), Windham Hill albums, and mid-19th century British literature as the primary influences on her music and musical style which is simple and direct yet very expressive and emotional. Her touch on the piano keys is velvety-smooth and elegant - no percussive sounds at all. I should also mention that Ms. Rowes sheet music transcriptions for all ten pieces are available on her website and in a Kindle version on Amazon.

""Daydream"" opens with Forever, one of the two trios for piano, cello and violin. Bittersweet and haunting, its a beautiful beginning. Midnight is also a trio for piano and strings that is somewhat lighter and dreamier than Forever, but every bit as soulful. The title track is a piano solo that expresses gentle feelings of warmth and contentment. Remember is one of my favorites. It begins as a nostalgic piano solo and then the cello enters with beautifully contrasting sounds and tonal colors. I love piano and cello duets anyway, and this one is wonderful! Past the Thorns is my favorite of the piano solos. Inspired by the books Jane Eyre and North and South, some of the passages are quickly-flowing and some are more subdued. I also really like Promise, a poignant and passionate piano and cello duet. Music Box is a sweet and innocent solo piano waltz that brings the album to a close. Much of the piece is played at the upper end of the piano, swirling and dancing freely until it gradually winds down.

Emily Rowe has produced a beautiful debut album, and I look forward to many more recordings and sheet music from her! Recommended!",1474070400,5

BTW Fritz L- the dance conductor- should  be Franz; and the soloists in the 1994 live Leppard 9th, acc Discogs- it's been issued on another label with more complete information- are: Gillian Webster soprano, Catherine Wyn-Rogers contralto, Martin(?) Hill tenor, Robert Hayward bass, w the Ambrosian Singers. As to the box itself , good so far, more later:).

90331,1306,18987,"I can see why people argue and don't like it. It's not like their previous albums. It's a lot more popish and doesn't really have that original sound we are use to having in their albums. It truly lacks the Head and the Heart. I mean I bought their previous two albums years ago and I still go back to them because they have that depth. It's not just the quality of the music but the heart and soul that clearly went into it. I don't think that Signs of Light has that.

I think with Signs of Light, as it is their first major record label release, they are trying to reach a wider, mainstream audience and because of that, A majority of the album really comes off as radio ready pop hits. Not to say that they aren't solid songs but again, They lack that heart and soul that went into previous works. And by doing that, I really do think it isolates their original core audience and that's pretty evident by the reviews posted for the album.

Signs of Light is a solid album and certainly worthy of 3 stars but it doesn't have any lasting quality. Once I go tired of listening to it, It's just gonna chill on the cloud service for a good long time.",1474156800,3

90345,9964,9304,"God certainly works in mysterious ways. Back when the Fab Four first started out, Ringo was depicted as the goofy dork with the big nose, while Paul was the cherub-faced poster boy. Put them both in a singles bar now and see who gets what. Although Ringo certainly has aged far more gracefully than jowly and wrinkly Paul, it's not just looks that allowed him to prevail over time. He may not be in the same league as Lennon/Mc Cartney as a songwriter, but as for George Harrison...what'd we get besides the plagiarized ""My Sweet Lord""?

""It Don't Come Easy"" is just one of a handful of classic pop tunes by the Happy-Go-Lucky Beatle. Like the rest, it is typified by his use of chorus vocals and a jam band ambiance. It sounds a whole lot like he brought all his party buddies into the studio with him and passed out the mics. Ringo's vox may not be as distinct as John's or melodic as Paul's, but it's East End London and it'll make you sing along. The content is simplistic, telling you that making it to the top of the ladder is never an easy climb. Ironically, George Harrison plays guitar on this song, though it's just icing on one fun-filled cake. RINGO RULES!!!",1474156800,5

90373,56,17242,"It is so sad whenever we have a artist become so overexposed, that they are more of a product than a real singer from the inside. The tragic truth about Beyonce' Knowles is that she is a product, not even a singer. Her albums have been so poor, that she does not impress me anymore. Now, with the oversaturation she had endured with making Lemonade, many people wonder if it was worth it, and tragically it is not worth it at all. The album in itself has been her lowest performing in not just sales, but airplay as well, since the failure of 4. Beyonce's latest single is more of heartbreak in regards to her marriage with Jay-Z, and also the failure of her mom, Tina's marriage ending in divorce, after Matthew Knowles cheated on Tina, and fathered a child out of wedlock. Hold Up, the third single from Lemonade, is the exact same and so-called heartfelt feeling of being taken for granted at the affair of the heart. But tragically, Beyonce Knowles fails to impress at the soul of the song. She really felt more spooked at the essence in her voice, but overall it really does not work at every note. If you're new to Beyonce' Knowles music, go back to Crazy In Love, and trust me it feels better than the wasted heart of Hold Up.

90380,3599,19095,"Move over Beatles, Corey done went and brought it! In what is for sure to be the biggest selling record of all-time, Mr. Feldman has done and  ""gone for it, go 4 it, go 4 it,"" Utilizing the musical brilliance of a backing band that can flat out hold instruments like nobody else, Corey has gone ""Lost Boy"" on us! Causing us to lose our minds at how great music can be, when Feldman decides to ""go 4 it, go 4 it."", I bought this album for the probing and insightful lyrics, but was taken back more by the complex musical arrangements and the all-star ensemble that calls it self the Angel band. One can only suppose that this is the very kind of music Corey used to listen to when he was learning music and other things from his musical idol Michael Jackson. I think if Michael was alive to day, seeing Corey on stage performing this music, would make Jacko ""go 4 it, go 4 it."" Please, Corey, stay clean, and keep following your dream of making music, you make us all want to ""go 4 it, go 4 it.""",1474156800,5

90383,11818,40,"5-star songs are *typically* the only songs that make it into my library. With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.

While a great deal of my music library is comprised of Amazon's free songs, I splurged and spent a whopping 69 cents on this one.  Thats right...Amazon has a FREEBIE / CHEAP section with both songs AND albums. A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a (more substantial) price tag. Anyway...enough of my rambling.

This album is great! At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?

90394,5846,18987,"I'm going to be very short and blunt -- in the first week of hearing this album I had some pretty nasty things to say (as many seem to) but upon further listens it has grown on me quite a bit. There is a most definitely Fleetwood Mac vibe to much of the album and that is NOT a bad thing and certainly is an understandable evolution of their sound. Many complain it is over-produced and to me that isn't the problem - the arrangements and production is excellent, yes, but I'm not of the opinion that it is by any means a bad thing. What does it for me is simply the lyrical content... while listening the past couple times all the way through the album, I was really really enjoying some of the songs I initially did not care for, but what kept it from working for me was the shallow songwriting, in many cases quite syrupy sweet, predictably rhymed, sentimental and melodramatic. It just becomes a bit boring and feels as if in some ways they have little to really say in these songs. Again, it's not a bad album - certainly not as bad as some make it out to be and there are elements to it I really love - but it isn't one I can imagine coming back to again and again over time. But then, of course, we'll see.",1474243200,3

The sound of the re-master is solid, but the packaging with no tracks listed and discs with no track listings leaves a bit to be desired. Whole lotta love seems to have been shortened as the ""melody part"" is no longer there. If your a fan like me and have all the deluxe versions, you will enjoy the extra stuff.

Undone is a lovely acoustic number with great lyrics and marvelous harmonies:-). Dear Misery, is a stupendous track and is playing on a loop. The silences are brilliantly done; Rice and Ward excel in this track. The ambiance created by the reverb is quite magical:-).

90508,7516,18783,"Beulah is a subtle, beautifully crafted album that is both rich lyrically and melodically.  For fans of The Civil Wars who were sad at the breakup, this album has all the strength of the songwriting that made that duo so powerful.  However while the last CW album was somewhat scattered in style, John Paul's new offering feels cohesive and intentionally sparse the whole way through.  Instrumentation is simple and fitting, B3 and cello adding texture where it's needed.  The backing vocals of The Secret Sisters is, in my opinion, much more fitting to his songwriting style than Joy Williams' sometimes overbearing harmonies.

These songs feel at once vintage and fresh, melancholy and heartwarming (listen closely to the closing track ""I'll Get Even"" - a beautifully backward love song).  My personal favorite is track 3, ""The Once and Future Queen.""  Oh, so haunting and delicate.  This is a pleasure to listen to and gets better with each spin.",1474329600,5

I watch her every morning
Putting on her make up
That girl comes without a warning
So addicting, I cant get enough
She gets dressed for work, grabs her keys then she leaves
Yeah that goodbye kiss kills me

There goes my everything
My everything
My all, my love for sure
Shes everything I wanna need
And then she's even more
When I see her face I cant help but think
There goes my everything

Everything, everything, everything...

Everytime were in a party
I still watch her from across the room
I aint notice everybody
They cant even help but watch her too
Dressed up or dressed down
And she cant help but shine
I cant believe shes mine

There goes my everything
My everything
My all, my love for sure
Shes everything I wanna need
And then she's even more
When I see her face I cant help but think
There goes my everything

There goes my everything

90519,12682,4092,"I remember my first introduction to ""Tangerine Dream"", was with the movie 'Risky Business', in the 80's.  I was intrigued by all the music from the Soundtrack, but 'Tangerine Dream', was a part of the living flow of this movie that stuck in my mind, and I later found out who they were.  Tangerine Dream is an established electronic music collective, German decent.  I have since listened to a lot more or the bands art.  This is a great song, and I would highly recommend it, and, ""The Dream Is Always The Same"", if you can find it.

The Offer Nissim remix is by far the best one available from all the versions out there. It is a proper extended dance mix much in the vein of It's a Sin or Can You Forgive Her - the glory days when all mixes appeared either in vinyl or then cd /cassette forms.
A Cloud in a Box is a good b-side track with a techno dub feel a la 80s flavour.

Tracks 2 and 3 A Cloud in a Box and the Dead Can Dance are typical b-side tracks with the first being the better one by far. Finally track 4 is the Stuart Price  remix. The TRUE GEM in the cd version is the inclusion of an ultra rare (previous only available on a limited vinyl run) Inner Sanctum Carl Craig C2 Juiced remix that is made for the clubs and is a pure delight.

Right from the title track that opens the album I knew I was in for fantastic treat. The energy and joy that is apparent in the song, be it the lyrics, the vocals or the accompanists. All are very infectious:-). Look at Those Clouds is brilliant with taking me down memory lane. How many times in childhood have I made wildly imaginative shapes out of patches of clouds? The chorus line is very, very nice indeed! Only One You (feat Tina Kenny Jones) is a song that is exuberant and celebrates everybodys individuality. This song is supremely well-sung too:-). Botany, Ah, now why didn't have such a good teacher when I was growing up? Such brilliant writing! Eyes in the Back of Her Head (feat Scott Totten) is hilarious! The bane of every kids growing up years, getting caught out by mom. This surely brought back memories!!! Antithesis is a glorious piece of writing and I loved the voice:-). Love is in the Air (feat Robin Goldwasser) is so much a part of growing up years. The giddy feeling of young love is something anyone can so identify with! This Dogs Best Friend is an ode to an animal that brings out the best in all of us. They make us better humans. For sure!! Im going to be playing this song to my pet for a long time to come:-). Three Little Words (feat Tina Kenny Jones) is a universal song of love and very powerful in its simplicity. The 15 songs in this album are extremely well-composed and produced are each a stand-out in their own right and can be listened to again and again.

90569,56,15264,"It is honestly been a rough several years for Lady Gaga. Her personal life have shattered in tragedy, with the end of her engagement with her beau, and also with the massive failure of Artpop. Unfortunately, she hasn't been able to shine in the utmost way she wanted to deliver to all of her little monsters. What I have found of her last album, Artpop was that the songs have not just only shown that she was tiring, but she really took a few too many leaps forward, to where it hired backfired upon her heart. But her lead single really was the sign that Lady Gaga had folded from start to finish. Applause was not really anything that showed she was able to shine in the way she had from earlier albums like The Fame. But Applause being remixed feels more it is a old hat that worn out its welcome a little too much. I just found the remix of Born This Way to be a bit better in the heart, but tragically this song remixed was clapped out a little too much. If you're a lady Gag fan, than I suggest you go too her other tracks from The Fame remixed like Poker Face or Alejandro. This applause was not worth a definitive standing ovation.

If that was the case- they could have sold just the 3rd companion cd for those of us who bought it 20 yrs ago.
Example- Dazed & White Summer are from the Playhouse Theater 6/27/69 show- make the show  complete by adding them to that cd
What is-Comm. Brkdwn-Thank You are from Paris Theater 4/1/71 put them where they originally were in running list of the show on that cd!!!

And why not put the songs you left off from certain broadcast with the shows they were originally on? Instead of separating them on a different cd??
ughhhhh, and why cut out the stuff I've been listening to for 35 years like the Isleys Bros. It's Your Thing on Comm.

The Highlight is Stop Pickin' On Willie.  Of the 15 song on here at least six are covers.  And it seems like all of them have a Willie or Waylon or Cash connection.  There is also Tulsa Time which has a  heavier beat then Don Williams' song but the arrangement isn't much different.  I would have given this cd one more star.  But the last song Angels Protect This Home.  Is flat out weird. It has an introduction that is ver two minutes long.  And it just sounds like background music to a t.v. show or something.  It's a duet with Miley Cyrus who I think is ooing and aahing.  Then once the lyrics start.  It's all kind of jumbled together.  Then the song changes  tempos about three or four times and just goes on and on.  Rambling for over nine minutes.  I was wondering when it was going to  end.

Ricky Kej has long been a champion of conservation and animal rights; this wonderful work is a heartfelt, clarion call for peacefor all of us to join forces to create the drastic change required to heal our earth and ourselves. Shanti in Sanskrit means peace and tranquility in a collective and universal sense. Samsar can roughly be translated as the world, but also signifies the endless cycle of birth and suffering and death and rebirth endured by human beings from which release is obtained by achieving the highest enlightenment. Mr. Kej has also teamed up with teams of wonderful videographers, photographers and conservationists to produce nine spellbinding music videos viewable online--showing the beauty and harmony of nature, wildlife and humanityespecially on saving Indias 30,000 elephants and restoring the Ganga River. There are also scenes of child neglect, wildlife encroachment, land abuse, toxic waste, air pollution, etc. but the vast majority of images and scenes are life affirming. Shanti Samsara is a powerful and beautiful line in the sand drawn by Ricky Kej urging humanity to do the right thing before it is too late.",1474329600,5

Asking if you're all alone

Put it out baby
We kiss and the flames
Just get higher

I'm all tangled up in barbed wire
I get burned, I don't learn
I'll be back, give it time
Yeah, I know it sounds crazy
But guess I like playing with fire

I could find a spot to
Go hang out on Friday night
Where you are gonna be
But I don't want to, no

Yeah, I could let it end
Call it quits, call off
All this on and off again
But I just don't want to

Yeah that key
Is right under the mat
Come on in, baby
Let's strike that match

I don't know, why I don't
Put it out baby
We kiss and the flames
Just get higher
But yeah I know
When I hold onto you baby
I'm all tangled up in barbed wire
I get burned, I don't learn
I'll be back, give it time
Yeah, I know it sounds crazy
But guess I like playing with fire
Playing with fire

So let's fire it up one more time
(Fire it up one more time)
Baby just put your lips on mine
(Lips on mine)

I don't know, why I don't
Put it out baby
We kiss and the flames
Just get higher
(We kiss and the flames

90616,11654,18163,"I can't explain how much I love this album. Every song has grown on me. Is it sad that Tom is gone? Yes, but...BUT...Matt Skiba is amazing and sounds great alongside Travis and Mark. I'd definitely say that this is the best Blink 182 album since Enema of the State. The fun is back, but there are plenty of serious moments, as well.
Highlights: Bored to Death, Los Angeles, No Future, Home is Such a Lonely Place, San Diego, California.... These are all amazing. Some are faster, some slower, all are great.
Beyond those tracks,  I really like the rest. Nothing on here I'd consider to be filler.
In a dream world, Tom would come back and Matt would also stick around. Probably not gonna happen, but it would be fantastic.
Side note:John Feldman of Goldfinger produced and co-wrote most of this record. That mean you're getting the main brain from Alkaline Trio  and Goldfinger with Mark and Travis. Its not a surprise that this album is so good.
Buy it now!  If it doesn't catch you on the first listen, give it time. Definitely gets better with each listen. I've been cranking it for the past two months.",1474416000,5

90619,16271,18980,"Where to begin?

Perhaps the starting point would be January 1971, when Dolly Parton, then just becoming a big name on her own (apart from Porter Wagoner) and having her first #1 C&W hit with Joshua, met this young, raven-haired Arizona native named Linda Ronstadt when Linda was doing The Johnny Cash Show in Nashville.  Dolly may not have known it then, but she had just met a future collaborator

Then, in March 1973, while on tour as Neil Youngs opening act, in Houston, Linda met up with modern country guru Gram Parsons, who got Linda together with his newfound harmony singer, Birmingham, Alabama native Emmylou Harris.  Linda and Emmy hit it off as friends and vocal partners like gangbusters.

And then on September 9, 1975, Dolly, Linda, and Emmylou convened in Los Angeles for an informal gathering of singing of traditional and classic country and folk songs that would spawn a Mutual Admiration Society.  The three women, who would become among the most influential female singers of their generation, became what they first humorously referred to as the Queenston Trio (a play on the Kingston Trio), and then just simply Trio.

But getting anything officially down in the recording studio and assembling it into an album would be enormously difficult in that period, as all three women had solo careers that were red hot.  Some of the things they recorded would end up on one anothers solo records over the next ten years, and appearances on one anothers albums were inevitable; but it wouldnt be until 1986 that they finally were able to set aside time and get down to business.  And in 1987, they finally came out with their landmark album TRIO, which would help define the female genders role in country, roots-rock, and Americana from that point forward.  In 1999, TRIO II would appear, solidly cementing their reputations as ultimate superstar collaborators.

And now in 2016, both of those landmark albums, plus twenty outtakes from those sessions and others, have found their way into THE COMPLETE TRIO COLLECTION, consisting of three CDs.  Both original TRIO records were produced by George Massenburg, whose working relationship with Linda goes back to her landmark 1974 country-rock album HEART LIKE A WHEEL; and the musicians featured on those albums, including David Lindley, Ry Cooder, David Grisman, Steve Fishell, and others, were all roots music veterans that the ladies had known for years.  The third CD has material that had to be left off the first two albums or which was put on their solo albums (My Blue Tears, from Lindas 1982 album GET CLOSER; Where Will The Words Come From?, from Emmylous 1985 album THE BALLAD OF SALLY ROSE), but which can now be seen as further revelations of each womans strengths.  The heretofore unreleased tracks that never saw the light of day until this point include such gems as You Dont Knock, In A Deep Sleep, Are You Tired Of Me?, and Grey Funnel Line, to name just four.  This third CD was assembled together by Emmylou and producer James Austin.

Beyond the extreme significance of this collections release in terms of all things Americana in music and the stature of each of the three ladies over the last 50 years, there are two more overriding reasons why THE COMPLETE TRIO COLLECTION is a collection that needs to be bought and heard so extensively.  First is the continuing dearth of female artists on country radio in light of all the Bro-Country frat boys out there; many women who are doing great work, but aren't getting much if any airplay to show for it, like Tift Merritt, Lindi Ortega, Margo Price, and Caitlin Rose, are musical descendants of Dolly, Linda, and Emmylou.  The second one is much more poignant and tragic, involving the fact that Lindas Parkinsons condition basically destroyed her ability to sing (and in fact is also making it difficult for her to even do the kinds of things we all may take for granted), meaning that this is the Trios valedictory lap.  In any case, this must be considered one of the best music projects of any genre to be released in 2016, featuring three great friends doing what they love doing best just for the sheer hell of it.",1474416000,5

90641,11892,19123,"John Burke is a composer/pianist who has composed film scores, directed musical theater and boasts a varied musical experience as a talented composer/pianist.  Orogen is his sixth release.  The definition of Orogen is: a region of the Earths crust where mountains are formed.  Loving mountains as I do, I couldn't wait to hear this CD.  On the inside of the cover the liner notes say: within each composition, an underlying melody gradually reveals itself.  So the notes and title set the musical expectation of an evolving compilation of melodies where by the end of the album the mystery of the melody is fully revealed.

Orogen opens with the track Arise.  This piece has a very energetic melody with a faster tempo.  With a majestic rock feel to bring the piece into being; Arise is a welcoming ascent into the musical experience that forms mountains made of music.  Spring Tides, the next composition on this album, is a motivating melody to set the mood for accomplishment. Almost more of a dance in its feel, this brisk piece really got me moving!  Another favorite on the album is Autumn Blaze.  The melody line in this piece is played with the left hand, above and then below the right hand, which keeps the tempo steady with an energetic pattern at the center of the piano. Like each piece we've heard so far, this song boasts of technical mastery, energy and skill.

Batholith starts out as a quieter melody and slowly builds in crescendo of musical enjoyment.  This piece drew me in as the listener to see what new the height the melody would fly me to. A bit more ambient than the others, this piece changes its feel throughout. The melody line goes from being pronounced, to being molded into the textures of the piece.  Batholith is the longest song on the album at 8 minutes and 44 seconds, but held my interest for curiosity to see how it would end.  The ending draws the piece to a gentle yet majestic close.  It did not disappoint, I loved it!

Riverswept was yet another favorite.  I could almost feel the angst and swell of a river as the melody both ebbed and flowed.  The melody smoothly transitions into the combination of technical skill and wooing the river to flow masterfully as his fingers sweep over the keys.  I could easily imagine the water traveling swiftly and sweeping me away.  After the river crests the ending flows perfectly into a gentler reverie.  Windflower ended up being my absolute favorite on the entire CD.  This composition teases the listener with an enchanting melody.  I loved the softer sounds this piece offered.  Windflower is the most reflective piece on the album, luring the listener with its peaceful and charming resonance. John uses jazz chords and fluctuating tempos throughout this piece to create the gentle experience of a sun filled afternoon in the countryside.  The melody sings into the upper register toward the end, bringing it to a graceful conclusion.  Simply beautiful!

In Earth Breaker you could almost feel the mountain ranges pushing toward the surface of the earth as the melody cascades over the keys.  The mountains are almost pushing this fast-moving melody toward the surface of a mystical and challenging shift. This composition is also a bit different from the others in that there are traces of romantic era chord progressions and techniques used, a nod to the great masters. The lower register brings this regal composition to a surprising and unexpected closure, a truly unique ending to an innovative piece!  The title track Orogen has more of a pop feel, and brings the album of ten embracing solo piano pieces to an inspiring and energetic close.

Throughout the entire album you can hear the skill and technical accomplishment of this composer/pianist.  I definitely could hear the influence of George Winston in this album, combining some elements of jazz seasoned with concise new age style.  I highly recommend Orogen for those who enjoy engaged listening and well composed musical complexity.  I will be adding Orogen to my list as motivating music to conquer the day.",1474416000,4

90713,1897,14387,"Usually Adele does just fine with her music.  Even if it's a song that you don't particularly gravitate towards, you can acknowledge that it is a well-crafted song.  Unfortunately, her song ""Send My Love"" is not one of those songs.  It is the prime example of all that is wrong with her latest album ""25"".  The entire album is lyrically and musically lazy.  It tries to coast on the strength of Adele's stellar voice.  It offers nothing else (certainly not the way ""19"" and ""21"" provided sharp song-writing and musical arrangements)

  ""Send My Love"" has several things working against it.  First, it is part of the mediocre ""25"".  Second, it has been so badly overplayed on commercial radio (well beyond how much ""Hello"" was played) that even the song's biggest fans or totally sick of it.  Finally, it is just an irritating song.  It has been described a peppier version of Adele's 'bashing her ex' songs.  At this point (3 albums worth), Adele repeatedly bashing her ex in song has gotten quite tiresome.  Make one of those songs with a more energetic musical sound is just obnoxious.",1474502400,1

90718,11818,18547,"5-star songs are *typically* the only songs that make it into my library. With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.

With that said, I did pay for this this song.  If however, you are just looking to build a music library on a budget, I'd highly recommend checking out Amazon's free / cheap collection of music, featuring songs as well as albums.  A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a (more substantial) price tag. Anyway...enough of my rambling.

This album is great! At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?

90720,11818,17420,"5-star songs are *typically* the only songs that make it into my library. With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.

With that said, I did pay for this this song.  If however, you are just looking to build a music library on a budget, I'd highly recommend checking out Amazon's free / cheap collection of music, featuring songs as well as albums.  A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a (more substantial) price tag. Anyway...enough of my rambling.

This album is great! At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?

90791,4505,2846,"The album is amazing. Obviously. It's one of the most widely acclaimed albums of all time for a reason. You know it. You love it. I'll save us time and skip the review of the music.

So about the remastering and the volume thing...

The vocals are brought up a bit and the band is brought down a tad. This keeps the vocals from being totally overpowered by the music. The end result is that you can hear Kurt Cobain's lyrics MUCH more clearly than you could on the original release. Now that it's no longer the early 90's and I'm no longer a teenager, I like this. Nirvana's lyrics were always amazing, but they often got overshadowed by the music, which was also amazing.  I like that I can listen to this now and really hear Cobain's awesome poetry crisply and clearly.

However, that makes this sound different. Part of the appeal to Nirvana back in the day was how they just put the music right in your face and made it push right through you. You almost had to work to hear the words, and that wasn't a bad thing. It immersed you in the music and made it a part of you in your attempt to really 'get it'.

Since I'm already familiar with the music and have been for 25 years now, I feel like the music is already a part of me and I'm glad to hear the vocals more clearly. Especially since I'm entering the ""Hey you kids! Turn down that darn loud music!"" stage of my life. But for listeners new to Nirvana, I'd suggest starting with the originally version of this album first.",1474588800,5
90792,15657,635,"I truly enjoy listening to this song. As a preschool teacher sometimes it's difficult finding music that I can play within the classroom that is suitable for children. Majority of my students are familiar with PBS and they adore Curious George. When this song comes on they start to dance and sing. Upside Down just creates a positive aura within my classroom.

90818,9713,18277,"I'm not sure what I was expecting from this album, but it sure wasn't this!  As a long time fan of Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, I've always seen Garry Tallent as the stalwart and dependable, but quiet and laid-back half of the E Street Band's rhythm section.  Knowing that Garry has spent a lot of time in Nashville, I thought I would be hearing a lot of tasteful, typical country-blues-rock.  And that would've been great!  Instead, Break Time shows us an extremely playful, relaxed, and joyful blend of rockabilly, country, and cajun styles.  His singing voice is assured and the music is played flawlessly.  From the moment the album started, I felt a smile on my face.  I love that he is having fun and it is clear that he is just enjoying himself, and the feeling is contagious!  It's taken a long time for Garry to break out and do his own thing, but I already can't wait for his follow-up album!",1474588800,5

Patty is a rather petite, yet she able to sing with such tremendous volume and feeling. Right at the beginning this song Patty lets out a long, loud ""Oooooooohhhh!"" I am amazed by the physicality of singers and horn players, and their ability to sustain a long, loud note.",1474588800,5
90846,7204,17169,"I like this recording very much. Because it is a very long recording, I fall asleep before the recording has ended. Mr Sealey's voice is very soft and soothing and lulls me to sleep. However, I later listened to this recording for the full hour, yes it is one hour, and I found it very helpful in encouraging me to both sleep and I also found it uplifting.
Although this is for sleep primary, it can also be used for a long and meaningful meditation. It does take one hour to fully listen to it, however, it is worth it.

What I liked the most about this recording is that it can be used two ways: One for relaxing and getting to sleep or Two for like an encouraging session with a caring person. The recording has so many helpful tips in it that are uplifting. When I fully listened to this recording, I found that I felt much better and more upbeat.

Highly recommend.",1474588800,5

90922,396,19143,"This is another great set in this series from Swiss Radio Days recordings.  The digitally remastered sound is very good--but not totally perfect--recorded in a studio.  The 23 page booklet has recording information, a short synopsis on Rollins and Silver, a history of the Swiss Radio days series, along with a list of releases in the series.  Be aware that the Rollins set has been issued on a 3 CD set of Rollins live in Europe in 1959.  The Silver set I don't remember being available.

Tracks 1-5 are the Rollins Trio from March 5, 1959  with Henry Grimes-bass, and Pete La Roca-drums.  Both players are relatively underrated but acquit themselves very well with Rollins.  The tunes are:  ""I Remember You"", ""I've Told Every Little Star"", ""It Could Happen To You"" ""Oleo"", and ""Will You Still Be Mine"".  These are some of Rollins' last recordings before taking a long sabbatical before emerging with a new sound--hear his live trio from the Village Vanguard in 1962 to hear the difference.  But this set is straight hard-bop with Rollins' Charlie Parker influenced playing.  The trio is tight--working intuitively on these tunes.  Pick any song and you'll hear just how good Rollins was during this period in a straight ahead style.

The Silver set (tracks 6--10) from March 9, 1959 is another fine example of hard-bop from the late '50s.  The band includes Blue Mitchell-trumpet, Junior Cook-tenor sax, Gene Taylor-bass, and Louis Hayes-drums.  Tunes are: ""Nica's Dream"", ""Cool Eyes"", ""Shirl"", ""Ecaroh"", and ""Senor Blues"".  This is the band that played on the classic Blue Note date ""Blowin' The Blues Away"".  There's a reason that album is considered a classic--this band was pretty awesome.  Both Cook and Mitchell played with Silver on other albums from the same period and their work was always worth hearing.  Both horns get in some good blowing, and along with Silver's piano work, this is another good set of hard-bop.

This is the type of album that if a friend asked you what  late '50s hard-bop sounded like, you could give them this double set  and they'd understand what hard-bop was all about.  And no matter if it's a trio or quintet setting, this is some good jazz--plain and simple.",1474675200,4

90958,16310,10122,"As I continue my rediscovery of Tori Amos, I find that there's so much here in her newer work to love!  It may not be as immediately accessible as her albums from the 90s (although those albums were not exactly super-accessible, either), but if anything her work has gotten even more complex, thought-provoking, and multi-faceted yet coherent over the past couple of decades.

On my first listen through ""Unrepentant Geraldines,"" I was like, ""Eh.  What is this?""  It was sort of like the Tori Amos I knew, and sort of a mess, or so I thought.  But on repeated listens I keep finding themes and threads that pull the album together.

Weddings and marriage come up repeatedly, both literally, as in ""Wedding Day,"" and figuratively or implicitly, as in ""Weatherman"" (the highlight of the album for me) and ""Selkie.""  The lyrical ""I's"" longing for, fear of, and frustration with, union with another is accompanied with a longing for truth and concern with deception, as she seeks assurances of the other's presence and truthfulness, even as she goes in search of the ultimate talisman of truth in ""The Giant's Rolling Pin,"" whose quirky sound hides a serious concern.  At the same time, time and the inevitability of aging figure again and again, whether somberly, as in ""Promise,"" politically, as in ""16 Shades of Blue,"" or with self-mocking amusement, as in ""White Telephone to God.""  All of this is woven together with fairy-tale references in songs such as ""Weatherman,"" ""The Maids of Elven-Mere,"" and ""Selkie.""  The final impression is of a lyrical voice that is both aware of its rootedness in its own body, and yet connected to the physical and spiritual worlds outside it through religion, mythology, and love.",1474675200,5

90995,482,18788,"""Real"" is my introduction to Lydia Loveless.  On the first couple of spins, I did not care for this set.  It reminds me of Emmylou Harris' ""Wrecking Ball.""  For me on both discs, the arrangements seemed to overpower the songs and the singer.  There are some tracks with which I connect.  ""Longer"" lets Loveless' voice dominate the rocking band with her heartbreak on her sleeve, ""Around 11 a.m., burned breakfast again.""  ""Bilbao"" also allows Loveless to cut to the chase with a romantic partner, ""Marry me, there's nowhere in the world that I'd rather be.""  ""European"" is another romantic plea to a lover with Loveless' vocals raw and urgent, ""And when you kissed me on the lips I was being European, honey, come on.""  While I don't connect with the entire set, there is enough here to make me pay attention to a fabulous singer.  Enjoy!",1474761600,4

Peace can sometimes allow one to escape, but sometimes you just need to let go on a louder level. The band has been around for awhile but I'm just now finding them. I find most of the music I love by accident, but when I love it, it becomes a part of my daily routine. This album has something for everyone.",1474761600,5

91139,15464,7846,"This album sucks. The first two songs are good but after that the rest is just all right. Some of the songs are hysterical and I'm just not into it. As a Catholic I was offended by the lyric ""I've abandoned cold religion"". A million Catholics were martyred in the 20th century so they definitely aren't cold. And we don't need to be crazy ""cool Christians"" in rock bands to be devoted to God. The spirit of the Catholic liturgy is a contrite recollection and sometimes a kind of sadness because we are calling to mind the sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross for our sins and making that present again in the sacrifice of the mass. I liked ""Arriving"" and ""See the morning"" and I even know how to play some of Chris' songs on the guitar. I saw him live and liked it but this album is not good.

'The Dream' is so full of rich sounding strings in a lovely arrangement, its one dream no one would want to wake out from.

91184,1399,19162,"Fred Hersch's trio with bassist John Hbert and drummer Eric McPherson has been together now for about seven years, producing four CDs, two of which were recorded live at the Vanguard in New York.  This release arguably even tops the quality of the trio's first three acclaimed albums, for, as Hersch rightfully observes in his liner notes, they were ""in the zone.""  The CD contains all of the first set, and two selections from the second set, as played on that Sunday night of March 27, 2016, when, Hersch writes, ""We captured lightening in a bottle in a way that is almost impossible to get in a studio.""  At age 60, Hersch continues to grow as a pianist in terms of harmonic richness and emotional depth, and the trio's interaction is becoming ever more refined and cohesive as well.  The program heard here is typically thoughtful and stimulating, featuring Hersch originals both new and previously recorded, plus pieces by Rodgers and Hammerstein, Lennon & McCartney, Kenny Wheeler, Jimmy Rowles, and, as customary, Thelonious Monk.

""A Cockeyed Optimist,"" the seldom played Rodgers and Hammerstein tune from South Pacific, begins with Hersch's dampened key intro before he presents the forthright melody.  Hbert's varied bass lines and McPherson's bustling drum patterns complement the pianist's texturally fluctuating solo that never coasts or lags in creativity.  ""Serpentine"" was inspired by a mysterious close associate of Ornette Coleman's, and is launched by McPherson's impeccable cymbal workings.  Hersch's rubato probings then overlay the drummer, classically oriented in form and substance, and leading to Hbert's plaintively dramatic, technically brilliant statement.  The leader closes with his majestic theme in all its glory, only hinted at earlier on.  ""The Optimum Thing,"" based on the changes of I. Berlin's ""The Best Thing for You,"" proves to be a buoyantly boppish fling from note one, making the listener think of a mix of Lennie Tristano and Herbie Nichols in Hersch's unpredictable and
unrelenting angular phrases and runs.

Hersch dedicates ""Calligram"" to French pianist and past collaborator Benoit Delbecq, who writes graphic scores that he calls ""calligrams.""  Oblique and provocative, with Hersch's free form piano, Hbert's forceful assertions, and McPherson's restlessly tense designs, this track displays the trio's keen rapport even when living out on the edge.  The title ""Blackwing Palomino"" refers to Hersch's writing pencil, which was also a favorite of Tennessee Williams.  Determined opening chords bring on a relatively lighthearted, bluesy theme, and the pianist's harmonically deep variations thereof, propelled by McPherson's actively surging rhythms and Hbert's sympathetic pulsations.  The version of Lennon and McCartney's ""For No One"" retains the arrangement Hersch used for his 1994 duo project with singer Janis Siegel, his piano slowly and touchingly expounding upon the melody for the sad lyrics, the effect at its peak being one of orchestral grandeur in trio form.

Kenny Wheeler's ""Everybody's Song But My Own,"" the title track of a 2013 Japanese trio album, is revisited as a tribute to the late trumpeter with whom Hersch frequently performed.  Its rhythmic and melodic character and vibrancy recall ""Someday My Prince Will Come,"" and Hersch's Bill Evans influence is most apparent in his stirringly inventive playing on this track.  Another previously recorded tune, Rowles' gem ""The Peacocks,"" is given an expanded 10:15 treatment, which includes a shimmering prelude, a magically poignant theme reading, and an harmonically sublime and entrancing solo from the self-possessed-- and here simply possessed-- Hersch.  As expected, Hersch covers a Monk tune as his set closer.  The spacious and slinky ""We See"" allows the trio to fully interact in a fairly unrestricted manner, as Hersch takes the theme on a circuitous, rhythmically infectious journey prior to some absorbing trades with McPherson.  And as always, Hersch plays his Grammy-nominated piece, ""Valentine,"" for his solo encore.  The classically tinged melodic line is tenderly unfurled over the course of a rapt 3:26.",1474934400,5

Awaken has the lovely cascading tones of the piano set to a very nice groove that captures the mind instantly. In The Beginning has a marvelous quality of a quiet, peaceful vista that just invites the listener to explore its facets.the melody of this track is hauntingly beautiful :-). Artificial Time is a lovely, abstract piece and a very engaging track. The high notes of the piano ring like bells in atmosphere.loved it! Piano Story(AM) is a moving and deep composition and affected a feeling of peace and introspection within me. The continuation in Piano Story(PM) is brought about beautifully with minor changes in the melody that change the complexion of the track..fantastic! I loved the tune of Moments that has melancholy undertones and is a calming balm on the senses. Age Of Eternity is a lilting and captivating and seemingly un-ending track with a very infectious and memorable melody that refuses to go out of my head :-). The title track 11:11 is of course quite apart in its composition and arrangement with its more techno and mechanical sounds.the numeric theme of the song is wonderfully brought out in the arrangement. The fascination of time and numbers and their constant movement are so well played-out by Fluker..I was blown away by his piano performance here!

91236,10648,19166,"This album is a brilliantly orchestrated and produced collection of the favorites of the season and will find a lot of takers Im sure! Away in a Manger has Hopkins lovely baritone rendering the gently melodious song, and the vocal harmonies are marvelous :-). Do You Hear What I Hear (feat Indigo Girls) has the quality of snow falling from the sky in the opening bars. This wonderful song with Hopkins great vocals ably complemented by the superb vocal tones of Indigo Girls is a favorite of mine! The all-time favorite O Holy Night is a charming addition. Again Hopkins adds his unmistakable magic with the wonderful composition. The lovely sounds of the fiddle is fantastic in What Child Is This (feat Balsam Range)..Ive always loved this classic :-). Silver Bells is another feel-good track that brings a feeling of longing for the holidays! Baby, Its Cold Outside (feat Laura Bell Bundy) has oodles of old-world charm that is utterly captivating with Laura Bell Bundys vocals :-). Blue Christmas and The Christmas Song are perfect for those nostalgia-filled, heart-warming moments and are absolutely essential for the holiday. Hopkins vocals are stupendous in these tracks. The chorus voices in Youre a Mean One, Mr. Grinch Welcome Christmas are fantastic and this is a brilliantly arranged and produced song. I had so much fun listening to this one! :-). Then the absolutely unmissable. Silent Night completes the aura of holiday magic around this album. Hopkins along with the brilliant Atlanta Pops Orchestra has again come up with an offering that immeasurably pleases the ears and perpetuates a feeling of well-being and happiness and peace :-) :-) :-).",1474934400,5

A Reflective Review  By Andrea R. Garrison  Online With Andrea

I love Andy Iorios II from beginning to end. His playing and composition is simple yet exquisite. His music is soothing, moving, emotional and stunning. When I listen to this CD I am captivated from the Opening track to the Closing. II has a magnificent cinematic feel to it that will inspire the listener to want to hear more from this musician who has a mastery of the piano that goes so far beyond the technical. II is a sensitive wonderful musical creation that will take you on a warm comforting ethereal musical journey. For more information visit the Andy Iorio website and listen to the Online With Andrea interview with Andy Iorio.

91316,9617,7638,"The Wikipedia story on this song is fascinating: Willie Nelson wrote it, then sold it for $150. And it was considered a ""cocktail song"" rather than country song by some, so it's production was delayed. And while over the years it was performed by a number of big name singers, including Frank Sinatra, I still think Price does it best. At least his version is the one that every now automatically begins to play in my mind. So let's consider it a contribution to that sometimes overlooked part of country, that quiet little corner where even a few cocktail hits are a perfect fit.",1475020800,5

91387,1036,101,"I heard this song on the radio a lot when I was a kid, so I had to buy it more for the nostalgia value than anything once I learned who had performed it.  Julian Lennon was criticized in his time for being too ""safe"" in some of his compositions, and this song unfortunately demonstrates that quality.  The lyrics are short and shallow, the theme is a bit repetitive, and it doesn't really bring much to the table.  However, the tune is catchy, and it takes me down memory lane, and it'll always have a special place in my heart.",1475020800,3

91398,1036,108,"Valotte is, in my opinion, one of Julian Lennon's best works.  It's an introspective song whose theme wanders a little, just as its lyrics do.  It spends most of the time seeming to address a broken relationship, and it sounds as though it might be that way through to the end.  But the final lyric brings the song to a close with a feeling of hope and strength, ending it on a high note that honestly brings a tear to my eye when I listen and try to take in the whole story.",1475020800,5
91399,1587,19180,"I had this exact record when I was a kid, my mom got it for me as I was 9 to 11 when Star Trek was originally on TV, the record was mono not stereo but the same tracklist and album photo.
The eleven tracks are:
1. Theme From Star Trek- right from the 60s, a now very campy version of the TV show theme
2. Alien - What Mr. Spock tells you he is!
3. Where Is Love - OK, so I don't love his vocals
4. Music to Watch Space Girls By- A 'space' version of a popular mid 60s instrumental hit also used in cigarette smoking commercials of the day
5. Beyond Antares - Another instrumental track, sounds pretty dated now
6. Twinkle, Twinkle Little Earth - One of the 4 best tracks of the album! Mr. Spock analyzes human culture
7. Mission Impossible - 'Spaced up' instrumental of the then TV show's theme, it must have been when he was thinking about that series after ST
8. Lost In The Stars - Another track where he sings
9. Where No Man Has Gone Before - Instrumental, I LOVE THIS TRACK !! Yes, it to is 60s, but it is the best Star Trek song on the album!
10. You Are Not Alone - The third track of the album where he sings, about alien visitors in the future. Of the 3 he sings, probably the best track.
11. A Visit To A Sad Planet - A short story of what Mr. Spock found that could still happen to us all! It was still the ""Cold War era"" then after all
Back in this era you bought the entire album and took your chances on what you might like on it, and I bought the entire album when I found it was available digitally for the personal nostalgia of it since I have no idea where my physical album went after all these years.
I would recommend just 4 tracks of the 11 if you're 'shopping'. Track 2. ""Alien"", Track 6. ""Twinkle, Twinkle Little Earth"", Track 9. ""Where No Man Has Gone Before"", and Track 11. ""Visit To A sad Planet"". If you want to here Nimoy sing, and in keeping with the Star Trek connection, then also Track 10. ""You Are Not Alone""",1475020800,4

""...It's Too Late to Stop Now...Volumes II, III, IV""  (CD & DVD)
(Sony Music, 2016)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Though I do dearly love Van Morrison's first band, Them, as well his early solo pop stuff from the ""Brown Eyed Girl"" era, it's his languid, richly mystical jazz-folk poetry-improvs of the early '70s that really sets the benchmark for his genius and eternal appeal.  This four-disc CD/DVD combo comes from that time, capturing four shows from 1973 where Morrison and his Caledonia Soul Orchestra delve deep into roots music soul.  This is a strong, confident band, taking huge leaps into experimental, genre-busting new terrain, with bold, exploratory solos and a commitment to improvisation and immediacy that leads to radically different interpretations of well-known classic material.  Longtime fans who have flocked to his shows or tracked down old bootlegs may not be surprised by these recordings, but they will delight in their newfound availability, particularly in such high-quality, beautifully remastered versions.  The real treasure here is the DVD video, with extensive footage of Morrison performing at his creative peak during a July 24 show at the Rainbow ballroom in London -- in short: wow.  Newcomers and devoted fans alike will find a lot to celebrate here. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Music Reviews)",1475107200,5

(Mountain Home Music Company, 2016)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A rock-solid bluegrass set from banjoist Kirsten Scott Benson, also known for her work with the Nashville-based band, The Grascals... The performances on this album are uniformly strong and committed, with Ms. Benson providing sizzling but understated licks throughout.  It's a technically polished production, but largely she avoids the too-smooth, by-the-numbers feel of much modern 'grass.  Benson's also a gracious and generous host, letting guests such as Terry Eldredge, Mickey Harris, Chris Jones, Shawn Lane, Rhonda Vincent, and Grant Williams sing lead on the vocal tunes, as well as letting her fellow pickers shine, including her husband, Wayne Benson, who plays some mighty sweet mandolin.

The ripples of harmony are excellent on Between ages it just takes you to another world altogether!

Well worth 5 stars though, just a great range of their BBC sessions back in the day and now with extra tracks. Just a shame that the chance was missed to include one or two actual broadcast sessions, with John Peel for example or THE session that Zeppelin fans consider the most memorable they ever did.

Overall, a nice nostalgic return for De La Soul. The beats are so lovely and the features really contribute a lot to their respective songs. The problem is there is not a lot of De La Soul rapping on this project. There will be minutes of just instrumental playing before they come in for a short verse.

Pretty sweet.  This compact modern blues trio project a strong, confident, convincing sound while running through a wide variety of styles.  I think it helps that these guys -- LA's Mike Eldred on vocals and guitar, along with Blasters sidemen Jerry Angel on drums and Mike Bazz on bass -- aren't newbies, but rather edging into middle age, and they bring depth and restraint to their performances, be it apocalyptic soul-funk-gospel, Delta blues, soulful acoustic folk or straight-up stomping roots-rock/urban blues.  I was impressed.  You might be too, particularly if you're a fan of, say, Los Lobos or Dave Alvin.  '80s blueman Robert Cray guests on one track, as do David Hildago and John Mayer on others.

A new album by bluegrass bandleader Doyle Lawson is always a cause for celebration... In recent years I appreciated his brief return to secular material, but you gotta admit, nobody does gospel quite like Mr. Lawson.  This album spotlights Quicksilver's immaculate vocal harmonies, in both fully orchestrated twang and shimmering a capella arrangements.  This edition of the band features Lawson on low tenor and baritone, with guitarist/multi-instrumentalist Josh Swift, Joe Dean on banjo, fiddler Stephen Burwell and pickers Eli Johnston and Dustin Pyrtle so surround an bear him aloft.  As always, the Quicksilver band serves as an incubator for top talent, and those these guys may be new names for many, I'm sure we'll hear much more from them in years to come.

I read somewhere where Slash acknowledged that Buckethead may be the technically superior guitar player but that he lacks the soul and passion. Listen to the title track to this and see how sorely mistaken Slash is.",1475193600,5

91513,56,18568,"There always has been something that has been said about Michael Jackson, past and present. Musically, he had shown a lot of brilliance. But personally, Michael was suffering internally and that is why he passed away so young. Yet it was already 7 years since the King Of Pop passed away and shocked the world. When Michael Jackson did release his Invincible album in 2001, it fell not just in poor sales, but disgusted promotion from Sony, and Jackson wound up abruptly leaving the label on protest and indignity. But also the songs didn't strike outside of the R&B arena at the whole. Heaven Can Wait is one of those overlooked songs that could've been bigger from he soul Michael had shown at the song. At the time, Michael was trying to fit into both the N'Sync & Backstreet Boys era, which feel through the cracks. But the song has had more cult status posthumously, as is the case with Maxwell sampling Heaven Can Wait for his song 1990x, which is a better sampled song at the soul. This is a good buy for die hard Michael Jackson fans, but not a must overall.

Song: C+",1475193600,3

 It's not going to be for everyone because some songs bring up feelings and ideas that some people will refuse to acknowledge. (Don't Hold Your Breath is a song that is universal)  If you're willing to look deeper you are in for a treat.

Musically, there are beautiful harmonies and a variety of appearances from other artists.  There are a variety of genres represented, there is a unified feel to the album but not necessarily a unified sound.  Be sure to listen to this album with headphones on or on a good stereo system  if you just listen on your computer or phone you miss a lot of beautiful subtleties.",1475193600,5

91591,13811,19195,"The Drive-By Truckers have asked that if you're not a liberal, please don't support them.  That is not a joke... that is out of Patterson's own mouth.  And if you think they're a southern band... guess again... they hate the south and have moved to Oregon to be around people that they can relate to.  They also believe your Confederate Flag needs to be surrendered to racists and any pride you feel along with it.  And of course they want you to watch their performance about how awful police officers are at the DNC.  Google DBT and their interview with Consequence of Sound if you don't believe me.  You can also Google Patterson's Confederate Flag article in the NY Times.

Now I've always been a fan of DBT...but the fact is, they are truly opinionated pricks and have the nerve to flat out tell you you're wrong if you don't share in their beliefs.  I don't care what you believe, but don't push it onto me or tell me I'm wrong because I don't share your views.  I have been to concerts, bought shirts, LPs, etc.... but no more.  Never again.  If DBT doesn't want me, I'll leave.

91686,524,19170,"""II"" is the succinctly-titled second release from pianist/composer Andy Iorio, following his 2010 solo piano debut, ""After the Rain."" While ""II"" is piano-based and has several solo piano tracks, it also features Matthew Johnson on violin and viola as well as some digital orchestration, giving the music a cinematic sweep that reflects Iorios background in film scoring. A graduate of Berklee College of Music, Iorio serves as the Musical Director for the Department of Theater and Dance at Union College in New York, is a sought-after private piano instructor and is a popular solo performer. The twelve original compositions on ""II"" are not overly complex, following Iorios goal to engage, inspire and underscore the emotional connections between people and to compose music that speaks a universal soul-stirring language that takes the listener along on a deep emotional journey that resonates within all of us (quoted from Iorios website). The twelve pieces are varied and range from very spare and peaceful to much more vibrant and energetic. In the liner notes of the CD, he tells a story that incorporates the one-word song titles and gives the album something of a backstory.

It appears that Andy Iorio is a master of understatement as ""II"" begins with Opening and ends with Closing. Opening is a very effective prelude that sets the tone of the album. It begins as a lively solo piano waltz, adds some deep bass tones that give it a mysterious feeling, and then the strings enter and the intensity builds even more. Burn refers to staring into the flames in a fireplace, reflecting on your life and true self. Passion and deep emotions run through this piece as the music soars. Descent refers to going deep into reflection, but also describes the  pattern of the beautiful chord progression. It also has a dark and mysterious feeling with the piano notes moving quickly while strings hold the long, sweeping melody notes - a favorite. Embers is a piano solo that has steady broken chords on the left hand and a spare, simple melody on the right. Silhouettes is also solo piano and begins as a slow, expressive waltz that gradually becomes livelier and then reverts back to the slower tempo. Rush is more about a surge of emotional energy than about being in a hurry. Piano and strings create an intense musical magic with the viola moving at a slower, more graceful pace while the piano spins and dances - another favorite. Waltz is a poignant minor-key beauty for piano and strings. Unspoken is a gentle solo piano love song that expresses warmth, tenderness and contentment - I really like this one, too! Lament is my favorite track. Dark and very intense, piano and strings reach deep into the soul. This would be wonderful behind the closing credits of an emotional film. The solo piano passage is stark but so evocative. Closing is more orchestrated and includes flute as well as piano and strings, ending with just piano. Once the piano is done at about 3:20, there are about 3 minutes of silence before the piano re-enters with a solo ending that is quietly soulful and optimistic.

""II"" is a stirring and very enjoyable musical experience and I look to hearing more of Andy Iorios music! Recommended!",1475366400,5

They are hit & miss depending on the tracklistings...and this Taylor Swift one is no different...what's good about it is it has download-only single versions not on the album's like ""Bad Blood"" with Kendrick Lamar as well as soundtrack cuts like ""Eyes Open"" from The Hunger Games and ""Today Was A Fairy Tale"" from Valentine's Day...it covers her whole career and covers almost all the bases all in one package...it also flows very well together and you hear Taylor's tunes as the magnificent creations they really are.  The only downfall is that she has so many hit records that 2 discs and 40 tracks don'r cover them all...most of the big ones are here though.  I don't feel guilty for owning this at all because I have all the official CDs and I got this in a trade no no money came out of pocket.

91701,56,13895,"Honestly there have been some songs that have came out of nowhere, and followed through with great followings that can establish a artist from obscurity than just be a flavor of the month. However, there are some that do miss the mark in its entirety. Rachel Patten has been one of those artists that has really came out of nowhere with her breakout song Fight Song this past year, that has really worked for her. But trying to follow it up, is more than met the eye overall. Rachel's song, Stand By You, the second single from her debut album Wildfire, isn't actually one of her better songs. I really didn't find the song to have the longevity that could've been shown beyond the words of the soul. I personally wasn't moved with this track at the spirit. Fight Song really was a song that grew on you. Hopefully, there will be more from Rachel down the road, and something that will make her more than a one-hit wonder in spirit.

91728,16393,4644,"I'm not sure there is a wordone word alonethat can do justice to what Steam Powered Giraffe (SPG) is and does. After all, their music CDs are just part of the acttheir stage shows, the costumes, the makeup, the puppets, the herky-jerky clockwork motions, the off-the-wall activation/deactivation sequences, the offbeat banter, the comic books, the back-stories and mythology are all part of the entertainment package: perhaps multimedia phenomenon is the best way to describe them.

Now to the album. First up is Steamboat Shenanigans. Imagine riding an Antebellum stern-wheeler steamboat, the water churning in incessant  giggles, and the black smokestacks huffing and wheezing with delight. Youre on the boiler deck, in the saloon. Then the nights entertainment is announcedthat's the feel of this song.

By the way, SPG is usually categorized as folk music. And there is some truth to that, with the guitar, mandolin, melodica, banjo, and accordion, with the folksy old time themes. But that categorization misses the distinctive element of having robots sing about old-time America defies any labeling. And what makes their approach so much fun.

Ju Ju Magic is Jonathan Sprague's main contribution to the album. Stylistically, it's different than the Bennett siblings style, and maybe that is why it catches your ear. Although the main weakness is The Jon's weak vocals. They could be louder; as it is, they are soft, and blur into the backing music.
Sprague also wrote Little Birdie. It's charming, and reflects the quirky gentleness of his personality. It's not a strong song, but I think with time and work, Sprague could become a decent songwriter. He certainly is a great performer.

These two classics, Me & My Baby (Saturday Nights) and One-Way Ticket, go back to their busking days in Balboa Park. They are great feel-good songs that Michael Bubl&eacute; or Harry Connick, jr. could sing, no problem. And it is a credit to the songwriting ability of the Bennett siblings that they can produce such songs that are gentle, moving, and so much fun.

If you can find the old YouTube versions of Me & My Baby, I think it is a better cut. The Spine and Upgrade sing this as a quasi-duet, and the phon/antiphon of the male and female voices conveys more romantic power. Think of Mobys <a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/South-Side/dp/B000051W6R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">South Side</a>, or Duran Durans <a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Come-Undone/dp/B000SX6HCY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Come Undone</a>. The female voice is just spicebut like Jennifer Garner, these ladies pack a kick.

(This raises the question: could the transgendered Isabella do a good duet with her brother David? I'm not sure it would work, since as twin siblings, their voices are too similar. If we could get Donny and Marie Osmond to do a version of this song, that might help settle the question.)

Rex Marksley is one of my top five favorites from SPG. But please be aware that are two versions of this songthe studio version, with has the animated segments illustrating part of the song, and a live version from Old Tucson theme-park.

The live version gives you an eye-opening experience to the supercharged fury that you experience with a live show. As the band plays the song, Rabbit pantomimes the lyricsas he does with Captain Albert Alexander.

And it is art. His (this is Chris, before transitioning) frantic motions sublimate into sign-language. He speaks the tongue of an angel with his body.
With this, I owe a deep appreciation to SPG: by their robot personas (and not the blank-faced, in-your-face stereotypes), they were able to make pantomime accessible to me. David, Isabella, Sam, Jonathan, Erin, thank you!

Automatonic Electronic Harmonics was my first exposure to the group (You see, my former roommate saw this video on YouTube about the top ten weirdest bands .). The video is classy, and, with my extensive background watching Hee-Haw in the 1970s, I labeled their music genre cyber-western. I think it fits this song.

It's not my favorite composition of theirs, but I got ittheir approach, and why it is so effective. This song is also important because they sing it in personarobots philosophizing.

It's not a silly approach; it's rather effective. Just read Richard Hanley's book <a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Is-Data-Human-The-Metaphysics-Of-Star-Trek/dp/0465045480/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Is Data Human?: The Metaphysics Of Star Trek</a> or thumb through Isaac Asimov's classic <a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Robot/dp/055338256X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I, Robot</a> where robots having a religion is discussed in the short story  Reason. What does it mean to be human? (See&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eternal-Man/dp/160907338X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eternal Man</a>) And what could robots teach us about human nature?

Prelude To A Dream and Make Believe are Michael Philip Reed's songs. Like Sprague's additions, they are different from the Bennett sibling's Victorian-era musical dreams, and this difference adds supple texture to the album. It was also generous to have the One-Man Band to have two moments in the limelight.

Honeybee No comment here: just buy it, and enjoy. A wonderful and charming piece that needs more airplay. In fact, just buy this one track, and don't worry about the rest. It's Isabella Bennett at her best. And the Freddy Mercury-like backing vocals just tickle your ear and electrify your spine (pun semi-intended).

Scary World. SPG is an optimistic band, but they do deal with the bluer and even blacker aspects of life. In this sense, they are like the hyper-optimistic Lindsey Stirling, who has songs like Shatter Me, and Where do we go when the Answer is no. Sadness and fear are part of life, and part of being humaneven if you are a robot.

And yes, that is Morse code at the end.

The Suspender Man gets you into the mood for Halloween. It's a retelling of Tommy Johnson (as in O, Brother, Where Art Thou?), or something that sold it soul to the devil. Like I said, it's Halloween music, but safe and fun for the children.

There is one question about this song: The antagonist (or antihero) of this song wears red suspenders (put them in a blender, send them to Nantucket). So is this a jab at The Jon, whose costume included broad, red suspenders? And if it is was a jab, was a playful jaba noogie, as the song Go, Spine, Go on the album Mark III. Or is it a foreshadowing of his departure?

In announcing Sprague's departure, Isabella Bennett mentioned internal conflicts and frustrations that subtly grew, and Sprague was let go. So this song, like Bunnys telling Blue Butterfly picture, may have been a portent.

The next three songs, That'll Be The Way Home,  The Ballad of Lily, and Airheart, form a musical triptych. We move out of the Gilded Age of Wells and Verne to 1904s. Steam-punk SPG is now Diesel-punk.

Again, these are heartwarming and charming songs. They are quite a relief from the so-called real world's saw-tooth jarrings. Like the Tin Woodman, these robots have soft hearts.

Circuitry is the closing song, and, bittersweetly enough, it was written by Jonathan Sprague, who was let go from the group several months after this album was released. As typical with SPG, their last track hints at the groups next musical direction. How Mark III would have been with The Jon will never be known, but we are grateful for what SPG has brought into our lives.",1475366400,5

91764,14445,19215,I admittedly wasn't the biggest fan of Touch Amor going into this record. With that being said I am now on board with these guys. This record is lyrically dense and has a lot of driving drums and bass patterns. The guitars can be shoe gazey at time and they definitely experimented with some sounds and they pieced everything together wonderfully. Whether you know someone that has lived with or died from cancer or not this record will punch you in the chest and tear your heart out. Great record that has stayed on repeat the past few days for me and will make it's way into regular rotation for me. This is what hardcore music should be.,1475452800,5

There is a lot of variety on this disc, and something for everyone to latch on to.

I personally really enjoy the song ""Great NIght"" which features another group we like quite a lot, Shovels and Rope. My husband likes ""Be Here Long"". And despite its sad subject matter, it's a good reminder to love those close to you and seize every moment you can. ""Don't Bring That Trouble"" is upbeat, catchy and the whole family loves it- including the toddler and preteen. There's really not a bad song on the album.

91824,3161,18964,"A quick scan through my reviews, and please do, by the way, will show that while I'm a dedicated metal fan amongst other things, I am not big on metalcore.  But for every rule is the exception.  Lamb of God is one, Whitechapel is the other.
  I have missed a few of their albums, but after good reviews I decided to give ""Mark of the Blade"" a shot, curious about the clean singing and the general progress these Knoxville, Tennessee terrors have made.  I'm pretty impressed.
  First, when you have three guitars in your lineup, you risk clutter and lots of it.  Unless you know how to assign each instrument distinct roles within the arrangements, you get basically a wall of noise that goes nowhere.
  ""Mark of the Blade"" starts off swinging, and Whitechapel have learned the fine balance between punishing riffage and clarity of the hooks, giving their attack much more musically diverse and even melodic where it really needs to be without sacrificing their patented approach.  Grunter Phil Labonte can be understood, and in two songs actually sings clean vocals, showing he has a nice voice and what the dynamics of real vocal melodies do for the songs.  Yes, there are those out there who still hate the trend going back toward real sung vocals, but we mustn't waste our time on that.  Fact is, these singers will have enormous throat and larynx problems one day, and some will revert to normal singing because of it, where I think it oughta be done just because I do not and have never liked grunting or shriek vocals.  That's probably my advanced age (55) speaking, but it's my opinion.
  Whitechapel have released a bruising album that is much brighter, more focused and detailed than previous efforts.  Good interplay between the axes, fine lead work, and impassioned vocals make this a great album in a genre that has very few really good outfits to boast about.",1475452800,4

91864,56,12931,"There is no question that Adele has been one of the best divas to have came out of the 2000 decade. Not only has she really delivered with each and every album, but her voice really has ignited in the way that divas have done before like the great Whitney Houston or British legendary divas like Dusty Springfield. When she came out with 21, she really ignited a fire that really has been more authentic than the joke divas name Rihanna and Beyonce' Knowles, because she has had altogether the voice, and the songs to match at the heart and soul that work better than met the eye. When Adele released 21, she made everyone listen because she had a great set of songs at the heart, and Someone Like You, the second single from the album is no exception. The song is really one that ignites from the soul and the mood. Adele really delivers with each and every withering note of the song, and it does not get tiring or overplayed, unlike product divas like Nicki Minaj or Britney Spears. This is one song I absolutely recommend if you are a die hard fan of hers, or someone new to her music.

Two examples that come to mind are THE LEGEND OF SLEEPY HOLLOW cartoon and the Haunted Mansion ride. As for the latter, the song Grim Grinning Ghosts is the perfect component of that ride. Its a giddy jingle led by Thurl Ravenscroft (thats Tony the Tiger) and does what a song like this should do for a haunted house ride, be fun with the right amount of spookiness.

91883,56,19229,"Utmost when it has came down to great rock bands, we really do not have a lot of artists that have really shown that they have the stamina and strength in the way music used to be. Hard to believe that Queen musically has been one of the most dynamic and influential acts that have ever came out of rock since the 70's. Yet it tragically has been 25 years since the tragic death of Freddie Mercury whom died of AIDS back in 1991. But their legacy is just as strong today, as it was back then. What I have always loved about Queen is that the strength and drive of those classic rock songs still speak louder than today's music acts have shown. One of my favorite Queen songs that came out from Queen back in the 80's is Radio Gaga. The song definitely is a great pop song that still shows how ambitious and brilliant Freddie stood at voice and sonnet overall. The song definitely is a great piece that still shows beauty from rock that has not been held for years. It has been 30 years since Radio Gaga, one of Queen's biggest opuses came out, and the song still ignite aflame that works better than what a lot of rock acts have missed out on for years. I sincerely recommend you download this song.

91897,12631,6837,"She was born Mary O'Brien in London, England on 4/16/1939. Dusty Springfield became an international pop star in 1964 with the release of her debut single ''I Only Want to Be With You''. Her winning streak continued throughout the rest of the 60's with major hits including ''Wishin' and Hopin' '' (1964), and ''The Look of Love'' (1967), both written by Burt Bacharach and Hal David, the team that supplied Dionne Warwick with most of her early hits. Of course everyone recalls her signature tune, the haunting ""You Don't Have To Say You Love Me"" from the summer of 1966.

In 1968 Dusty Springfield decided that it was time to shift gears. She made the decision to leave the comfortable confines of Philips records and signed a new deal with Atlantic. Now Dusty had always been a huge fan of all of those great black singers from the early 1960's and longed to record that kind of music. Her debut album for Atlantic was ""Dusty In Memphis"" which is considered to be a classic. The debut single from that LP was a tune that Aretha Franklin had inexplicably rejected. ""Son Of A Preacher Man"" would go on to become a Top Ten hit in both the U.S. and in England. This is the original hit recording you would remember from the radio.",1475539200,5

91953,15079,19195,"Thing is this band has always been liberal.  So for all of the fair weather fans offended by this, you should have known your band better.  Just because geographically they are from the south they are the furthest thing from that traditional mindset.  I think people tend to be as naive about politics and their emotional beliefs when voting which may have something to do with the downfall of our country right now.  This album is 100% what needed to be made.  It is punk rock in its stance on the issues of society.  No band out there has the ability to so creatively discuss matters of society from the every day man like DBT.  They are a band for the people.  This album is one of their best ever.  Traditionalists will say its their best since TDS or DD but for me, I think the band has really hit a stride since EO.  This continues that trend.  Mike Cooley has found his songwriting mojo and is pumping out catchy lyrical gems left and right.  Writing songs about the corruption of the NRA(Ramon Casiano), police shootings (What it Means) confederate flags hanging in government buildings in the south (Surrender Under Protest) to clear channel wanting to ban a song from radio air play after 911 (Once They Banned Imagine), this band captures the essence of what is wrong in society right now in an almost college professor type articulate and real way.  For the misled fans who this album offend like Patterson stated they don't need you as fans.  This band has been through it all so the last thing they are concerned with is a group of fans who politically have their panties in a bunch.",1475539200,5

The first DVD-A contains the new stereo mix of the four original album tracks plus the extended ""Dance Of The Dawn"" in High Definition. The second DVD-A contains the same mixed for 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio Surround Sound, along with a flat transfer of the original album from the master tape source. The Blu-Ray disc retains the content of both DVD-As along with a plethora of extras, including the ""alternate"" album version, the five single edits, new stereo instrumental mixes of the album tracks and extended ""Dance Of The Dawn"" in DTS-HD Master Audio, and two ""needle-drop"" vinyl transfers; from the original UK LP pressing and the US banded promo LP pressing. Whew...!

TALES FROM TOPOGRAPHIC OCEANS, the group's sixth studio album, is considered by many the most controversial of the YES canon. Coming off the mega-selling CLOSE TO THE EDGE (#3US, #4UK), which featured just three tracks, including the side-long title cut, the band was blindsided by the departure of drummer Bill Bruford. Although an extremely gifted and popular member, Bruford was tired of the personal conflicts and the constant state of friction between him, singer Jon Anderson and bassist Chris Squire. When scouted by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/KING-CRIMSON/dp/B00065MDSG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">KING CRIMSON</a>&nbsp;honcho Robert Fripp, who was putting together a new version of the titular groundbreaking progressive group, Bruford quickly bailed. With a world tour on the horizon, the band settled on Alan White, mostly known for his work with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/PLASTIC-ONO-BAND/dp/B000002UT9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">PLASTIC ONO BAND</a>&nbsp;and on John Lennon's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/IMAGINE/dp/B003Y8YXFS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">IMAGINE</a>, who had three-days to rehearse (!) before the tour commenced (most of the content of the band's next release, the live&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/YESSONGS/dp/B000002J1Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">YESSONGS</a>&nbsp;were recorded on said tour). During a stop in Tokyo during the tour, Jon Anderson was inspired to write a four-part epic based on a lengthy footnote within the book '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Autobiography-Of-A-Yogi/dp/0876120796/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Autobiography Of A Yogi</a>' that described four ""shastras"" or treatises covering all aspects of religious and social life. Anderson approach guitarist Steve Howe with his idea, and when Howe agreed they began working on themes and instrumentation, conceiving the project as four side-long album tracks. Unfortunately keyboardist Rick Wakeman disagreed with the concept and musical direction, but agreed to finish the material, even though he considered it too avant-garde, bloated and padded. The songs were credited to Anderson and Howe, with music by YES. TALES FROM TOPOGRAPHIC OCEANS  was the first YES album to utilize 24-track recording, although they had numerous issues with the equipment. Wakeman found himself often bored and spent a lot of time in a nearby pub playing darts. He also contributed to BLACK SABBATH's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SABBATH-BLOODY-SABBATH/dp/B000002KET/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SABBATH BLOODY SABBATH</a>&nbsp;which was being recorded in an adjacent studio. A tour followed where the group performed the entire album live, which I'm proud to say I caught twice. Afterwards, Wakeman was the next to jump ship, onto a fairly successful solo career, rejoining YES on and off throughout the remaining years. Although panned by many critics, who held the album as an example of progressive-rock excess, it was a stunning commercial success. It was the first UK album to ""ship gold,"" and topped their charts for two weeks, in the US it made #6 and also certified gold (over 500,000 copies sold). The band toured behind the album from November 1973 to April 1974. The band also broke attendance records at the UK's Rainbow Theatre, selling out five consecutive nights, a rock band first.....

The set comes in two mini vinyl replica gatefold sleeves within a slipcase, at first the cover art looks the same on both, but on closer inspection the second has a subtle difference (I'll leave it for you to discover). The disc labels reproduce the record labels found in the original 2LP set, in both the original (Discs 1 & 2) and ""tweaked"" (Discs 3 & 4) versions. The booklet features new sleeve notes by Sid Smith along with portions of new interviews with Jon Anderson, Steve Howe and Alan White.  Besides rare photos and archive material the original artwork has been expanded, restored and approved by long-time YES illustrator Roger Dean. My only complaint is the lack of easily readable lyrics. Either an expanded booklet, a separate lyric booklet, or a mini-poster of the original (and beautiful) inner jacket is sorely needed.  As is you need a magnifying glass or your old LP to follow the lyrics, which are a major part of this masterwork, and enjoy the now minuscule inner artwork........

To quote Steven Wilson: ""I worked on and off for about 3 years on this new mix in my quest to do it justice. I hope it will satisfy the people who agree with me that it may just be Yes's pre-eminent masterpiece.""

As with RELAYER, another dense recording, the added surround, center and subwoofer channels open the compositions wider, helping the listener to discern parts and themes buried in the conventional two-channel mix-down. I wish they had included a surround version of the instrumental mixes found on the Blu-ray, although the listener can again discern more from the absence of vocals, a 5.1 mix would've been the icing on an already delicious platter. Mirroring their genesis, all the tracks are credited lyrically to Anderson/Howe, adding Squire to ""The Ancient / Giants Under The Sun."" The music is credited to the entire band as well as the track ""The Remembering / High The Memory."" Anderson and Howe felt TALES FROM TOPOGRAPHIC OCEANS to be innovative and breaking new ground, whereas the critics let loose, some calling it the death-knell of progressive rock. . It's arguable that the architect of the album's sound-palate this go-round is Howe, who's playing throughout is stellar. Even though he has spoken bout his distaste of the opus, Rick Wakeman devised many unique and daring keyboard passages, providing the ""glue"" so to say, that binds of the disparate parts. One of the pluses of Steven Wilson's remix is the liberation of Chris Squire's bass, which seemed lost most of the time in the original mix. Surprisingly the MVP award goes to the new kid, drummer Alan White. To be thrown into the maelstrom of a mega-popular band's tour on three days notice while facing the prospect of contributing and recording four side-long compositions must've seemed daunting indeed! White not only acquits himself with a rock-solid steady base underlying the music, he also contributed melodies, a bridge and piano on ""Ritual."" His finest moment however is leading the band during the astounding ""Ritual"" percussion break, the rarest of rock animals, a drum/percussion solo that's not boring. The two outtakes of ""Dance Of The Dawn,"" basically live in the studio run-throughs, are terrific as well, and best exemplify the talent, genius and innate musicality of the band called YES......

All said, the remastering is stellar, the remix will depend on individual tastes. As with his remix of RELAYER, Wilson brings forth many passages, sounds and nuances buried in the original mix. Is it better? Well, while the 2003 Rhino remaster was great, hearing this prog monster in surround sound is a whole other ballgame. Wilson's remixes/re-imaginings are always well done, you never sit there and think ""gee, this sounds lousy"" unless your a dyed-in-the-original-listened-to-it-2,000-times advocate for the original recording, which is also here as a ""flat transfer from the original tape source"" as well as needle-drops from the original UK LP and US Promo LP (the latter two Blu-Ray only).  I look on these YES remixes as a complimentary additions to the original recordings. Considering the length of TALES FROM TOPOGRAPHIC OCEANS and the breadth of extra material you would have to spend many, many hours listening to and comparing the different versions to note the exact differences. I say, take it on it's own merits, and enjoy! Fans will definitely be pleased, and those either new to the album or critical in the past will have to judge it's merits. Me? Well anyone who has read my review of FRAGILE will note that I was disappointed that TALES was not the next release after RELAYER. You'll have to excuse me, I'm dying for a second/third/fourth listen......

least we forget, the band:
Jon Anderson - lead vocals, harp, cymbals & percussion
Steve Howe - electric 6- & 12-strings, steel and acoustic guitars, electric sitar & backing vocals
Chris Squire - acoustic & electric basses, timpani & backing vocals
Rick Wakeman - grand piano, RMI Electra-Piano, MiniMoog, Mellotrons, Hammond C3 & pipe organs
Alan White - drums, piano (Track 4), vibes, Mini-Moog, Moog drum, tubular bells & assorted percussion

After the album release and tour Rick Wakeman (who on record has called the album ""padded and bloated"") decided to go solo with A&M Records who had been pursuing him ever since the success of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-SIX-WIVES-OF-HENRY-THE-VIII/dp/B00Q5V6RYG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE SIX WIVES OF HENRY THE VIII</a>&nbsp;(#7UK, #30US).  YES eventually chose Swiss keyboardist Patrick Moraz, late of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/REFUGEE/dp/B0043A0UW6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">REFUGEE</a>, as his replacement and released&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/RELAYER/dp/B00NAYYSS8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">RELAYER</a>, another successful (#5US, #4UK) a three-track but this round single-disc album. After they toured THAT album, the individual members all recorded solo albums, with Moraz  eventually escaping the dreaded psychological pressures of being a YES member. He later was off to a dozen-year stint with THE MOODY BLUES, only to be replaced by...Rick Wakeman! The reunited TOPOGRAPHIC OCEANS band recorded two albums, the back-to-basics&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/GOING-FOR-THE-ONE/dp/B00007LTIC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">GOING FOR THE ONE</a>&nbsp;(which is rumored next in line for the Steven Wilson magic ears remix) and the disappointing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TORMATO/dp/B00009Z574/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TORMATO</a>. As if the YES saga could get any stranger and complicated, Jon Anderson and Wakeman jumped ship, to be replaced by Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes, late of one-hit MTV-opening wonders THE BUGGLES.

Francesca Blanchards debut album is rich in the contrasts on which art thrivesconnection/solitude, wisdom/experience, anxiety/uplift. As for the form/content duality that animates critics, she offers a soft and stunning voice and incisive lyrics, carried aloft by a blend of folk and French chanson, accented with jazz, country and pop touches. At the albums heart, the two visionsmore complementary than contrastingreflect the tension and creativity of Blanchards bilingual life (French father, American mother). Deux Visions is divided into six self-written songs in each of her parental languages, deeply personal ballads that paint vivid images as she simultaneously finger picks her guitar and tugs on heartstrings. Rame (Row) channels struggle and endurance: The ocean is so troubled/The shore is out of view, she sings. The storm is approaching/Darkest thoughts encroaching. Tu nexistes pas (You Dont Exist), is a whimsical parody of imaginary love: You read all my thoughts/When you look into my eyes, she posits, Its the world that Ive invented/Youre just a dream that I have rented. One of the loveliest tracks in English is Now That You Are Gone, a mellow/melancholy look back on first romance, with a coda of innocence: I will never love again/Like I loved you. Other autobiographical songs include Le Blues, about finding her place in her family; Wanderer, about searching for her niche in the world; and Home Is a Cage, describing her effort to embody an 80-year-old Polish immigrant for a college play. Blanchards oeuvre embraces many facets that all come together in one voice; however you divide the elements, it adds up to a penetrating and luxurious vision.",1475539200,5

""Saddle Up"" is a classic camp song, a great time for story-telling :-). ""CowCow Yippee"" is utterly silly and funny and marvelous...great vocals! Loved the guitar and fiddle in ""The Great Divide""which also has a lovely hummable melody. The writing is superb in ""The Legend of Tall Talkin Sam"" and the vocal harmonies are done wonderfully. ""Sister Moon and Brother Sun"" with its Native Indian chants is a great story told musically and is a very, very lovely track :-). I loved the accordion accompanying the vocals in ""Somos Amigos""...makes it wonderful folk-flavored song.

""You're Gonna Miss Me (When I Get Home)"" has brilliant guitar riff and a superb brass section that adds a lot of sass to this song :-). I found ""Joliet Bound"" exceptionally well-written with a very dark quality to it. ""Outlaw"" is a supremely stylish strut :-)....very well orchestrated. ""Bright Lights, Big City"" feat. Mindi Abair is a languid number just made for easy listening. The old-world charm of classic blues with ""Hollywood Blues"" just got better!

Starting with ""September 79 that has a lovely brass section and keyboard giving a wondrous accompaniment to the genius saxophone. I had a hard time going on to the next track from herethe lure of playing this track on repeat is that great :-). American Beauty is a sensuous, sinuous and molasses-sweet track. This composition is undoubtedly my favorite of the album. She Loves me is addictive with its very compelling rhythm and the winding and flowing melodyloved it! Next to You is tailor-made for slow dancing with ones beloved! Perfect mood-music :-). The soaring notes of the opening bars of Montreal are beautiful ; the melody is luminescent, fresh and took my breath away!! Monday at Gerts has a superb guitar improvisation that is absolutely bewitching. Rain has a deep-seated piquancy to it, the melody is outstanding and Snitzer is simply awesome here!

The song itself has a catchy hook, clever lyrics and Junior Brown's voice. I am not a huge country music fan but I love the style and sound of this kind of country music. First rate all the way.

Only complaint I have is that when loaded into my laptop the first disc comes up as the Greatest Hits video disc and excludes Marigold but I still give it a five star rating. The titles are easily enough changed for storage purposes and technically Marigold isn't a Foo Fighters track and I already have it with the Nirvana box set. The band's interpretation of other bands material is always interesting. Sometimes it's completely faithful to the original or sometimes they make it their own like with Baker Street. All in all definitely worth the cost and there's no other way to get these tracks unless you hunt down all the obscure singles and expanded versions of their albums. Considering that the future of the band is uncertain at the moment now would be the time to pick this up. *****",1475625600,5

92052,16408,11426,"Though it wasn't a hit, I thought FRANKENWEENIE was Tim Burtons best film in years (though I did also like BIG EYES). Released in 2012 after DARK SHADOWS, the film was for me a return to form for Burton and it was the better of the two movies. Of course, it was nice to see his frequent musical collaborator Danny Elfman be there as well. Though I don't think it's better than the pair's first stop-motion effort, the Burton-produced THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS (that was simply one-of-a-kind), I do like it more than CORPSE BRIDE. This score is in keeping with Elfman's family-friendly scores of the time such as CHARLIE & THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY, CHARLOTTES WEB and MEET THE ROBINSONS, a sound which in various ways still continues to this day (such as with MR. PEABODY & SHERMAN).

Main Titles introduces the lovely if not exactly memorable main theme, a sort of mini-waltz played on woodwinds that has a lot in common with the themes in those other scores. Game of Death is the films turning point and The Funeral is a very touching follow-up. The action really starts with the driving Electricity"" and Re-Animation"" is appropriately full of energy. After a few humorous tracks (including a homage to a certain Franz Waxman theme) the action gets going again. Getting Ready is an exciting primer for the big action climax, which starts with the thrilling Making Monsters, continues with Pool Monsters Attack and Mad Monster Party (love that track title homage!), and concludes appropriately with Final Confrontation. Happy Ending wraps up the score and two bonus tracks (Alternate Main Titles and Over the Fence) wrap up the album.

Its interesting to compare and contrast this with DARK SHADOWS, both the film and the score. While this film is one of Burtons most inspired, it has one of Elfmans most conventional scores.  Furthermore, while the other film had a more interesting score, this one has a more entertaining album. Its just shy of an hour, but it flows by really smoothly.",1475625600,4

The awesome ""Loving You Sunday Morning"", the head-riveting ""Lovedrive"", ""Another Piece Of Meat"" and ""Can't Get Enough"" are the Scorpions tunes that initially drew me in - back in the day. Nice to also hear the band's pre-platinum material as well - like the opener ""Pictured Life"", ""Backstage Queen"", the rocking ""Fly To The Rainbow"" and ""Top Of The Bill"". Hmm, didn't realize it at first but with this 'Live In Tokyo 1979' disc, they tag on four extra bonus cuts from the Scorpions' - Donnington 1980 including ""The Zoo"" and [a much welcomed repeat] of ""Another Piece Of Meat"".

Their voices are truly beautiful, their love of music comes through, and I'm already crazy about the tune.  I found it a little hard to understand because of the British accents, but I found the lyrics, and they pretty much sum up the longings of the human race.

A truly beautiful work; I recommend it to anyone who loves human voices sung a cappella in harmony.",1475625600,5

92067,1895,19253,"From Manchester, England, this innovative jazz trio of pianist Chris Illingworth, bassist Nick Black, and drummer Rob Turner are exploring the edges expanded by The Bad Plus, Nik B&auml;rtsch, and E.S.T.  This album. v2.0, is indeed the second of thus far three (the last having caught the ear of Blue Note Records), and we find chordal percussive piano, ricky-tic snare drumming, and deep sonorous bass picking and bowing. Melodies are somewhat sing-song and modal and the driving rhythm is staccato. This is exciting music that captures attention. Within its limited, minimalistic style is yet a universe. The music is imbued with trance-inducing quality, a chordal-drone effect, which explains its attractiveness. This contemporary free jazz taps deep emotional hubs. The listener will not walk away humming a tune, will not be awed by the complex interweaving improvisations, but instead will be fulfilled by a musical adventure in the exotic land of self.",1475625600,5

92092,1829,16910,"Twenty88 is a collaboration project that I've never expected, and honestly it is a project I never wanted but after listening to this album a couple of times, I am thoroughly convinced this album is good, maybe even really good. Big Sean and Jhene Aiko as solo acts can be a hit or miss for me. Big Sean's ability as an MC have always been underwhelming to say the least and Jhene Aiko's vocal range have been always limited. But I must say, there is an amazing synergy between these 2 that I rarely seen between other duo acts. Big Sean and Jhene Aiko's chemistry on this album is an undeniable and I would be lying if I said they don't sound great together. The real star on this project however is the production. The sounds on this album can range from slow experimental one minute to soulful the next; needless to say the music itself deserves some much needed praise. There is a nice balance of new and old that R&B fans and alternative hip hop fans can appreciate.

All praises aside, this album has many flaws with the first have to be the songwriting. This album is an R&B album if anything else with the two of them exploring the different sides of love. It's sexual, intimate and passionate which is great, however I cannot stand some of the incredibly cliche lines that are on this album. These songs are very straightforward with little to no room for subtly which can be a problem at times. The second complaint I have is with Big Sean. Big Sean is known to be corny at times and very monotone which is still present on this album, but I can't help but feel that Big Sean was trying his absolute hardest to do his best Drake impression. There were far too many times where Big Sean sounded identical to Drake and I have to knock off points for that. Other than that, if I don't get another Twenty88 problem that would be fine with me. This album accomplishes what it needed to and it sounds great; I don't see a need for another one.

The first song of any album pretty much sets the tone for the rest of album in question, and without a doubt, they made a fantastic first song... Evolving.  I'm a music junky, I can listen to music for hours on end, And lately I've been listening to music more than I watch TV now.  This music generates scenes in my head when I lay down, and make me feel free when I'm on the go, it has even improved my self confidence to do things I haven't done before, and work harder when I'm at work. In fact the other day, i, and one other person were recognized at the morning meeting.

92225,18,19270,"Phantogram is a NY-based duo comprising of Sarah Barthel on vocals and Josh Carter on keyboards, that's it. I absolutely loved their 2010 debut album ""Eyelid Movies"", which I had as No. 2 on my list of best albums of that year. Afterwards, with heaving touring and various side projects (and a deserved break surely as well), it took the band four years to return with a second full-length album, the ok but less adventurous ""Voices"". When we last heard from the band, just last year they released a well-received collaboration album with Big Boi under the ""Big Grams"" moniker. Now comes the band's highly anticipated third album.

""Three"" (10 tracks; 37 min.) opens with ""Funeral Pyre"", full of scratches and distortions, and Barthel's voice front and center. ""Same Old Blues"" (4th radio single) does not of course sound bluesy. ""You Don't Get Me High Anymore"" (1st radio single) is super-catchy and about as mainstream as Phantogram has ever sounded. It should've been a big hit on radio if mainstream radio was any good (which of course it isn't). ""Cruel World"" (3rd radio single) opens as a ballad, only then to crash into your headphones or living room with the chorus. Side A concludes with a Josh Carter-fronted songs (""Barking Dog)"". I'm sorry but when you have Sarah Barthel in your band, Carter should never be fronting a song. Much better is the Side B opening track, ""You're Mine"", where Barthel and Carter trade lines. ""Answer"" and ""Destroyer""  are the quiet moments on here. The epic ""Run Run Blood"" (2nd radio single) is another absolute highlight, with a mesmerizing beat. The album concludes with ""Calling All"", another irresistible track, what a great way to close out. Bottom line: It seems that the band continues to evolve further away from their early days' trip-hop sound, and instead now focus squarely on dance-oriented tunes. It's likely to gain them yet more fans, so good for them.

I've had the good fortune of seeing Phantogram a number of time in concert over the years, going back to their early days in 2010. (I saw them just this past June in the ""Big Grams"" combo, what a fun set that was!) Live the songs always sound much harder and heavier than anything you hear on their albums, and I bet that will be the case again with the new songs. If you have a chance to catch them in concert, do not miss them! Meanwhile, ""Three"" is a nice album, albeit less adventurous than their previous stuff.",1475798400,4
92226,10772,19195,"Worst LP or CD they have ever put out. I have all their music & have loved it all till now. By the way , I have seen them in concert 3 times. No excuse for going political. It's one thing to insert something political in a storyline. It's another to be lectured by a bunch of stupid Liberal Musicians for the entire CD. Give me Skynyrds God, Guns & Country anyday of the week. They have just lost me as a fan after at least 15 years. Get back to Muscle Shoals & grow up! Very very sad.",1475798400,1

92238,16408,19273,"The pairing of producer Steven Spielberg and director Tobe Hooper made for a horror classic with 1982s POLTERGEIST. Key to that status was the score by Jerry Goldsmith.

The album opens with a lovely rendition of The Star Spangled Banner before it cuts to static. From then on, the terror begins with The Calling/The Neighborhood (Main Title). This track does a lot actually, by first introducing the dissonant ghost effects which aren't to dissimilar to what he did in STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE before getting to the beautiful main theme, a haunting lullaby for the young female protagonist, Carol Anne. Goldsmith gets a lot of great mileage out of that theme. Goldsmith lets loose with the terror on The Clown/Theyre Here and the choir on Twisted Abduction. A lovely, almost heavenly piece comes in the middle of the album, The Light which offers the only respite from the terror. That terror kicks into high gear again on Night Visitor/No Complaints. It Knows What Scares You is a great suspenseful build-up which segues into Rebirth, a piece of ghostly beauty. Night of the Beast is an aggressive piece of horror action scoring and Escape from Suburbia is the exciting climactic action piece. The album closes out with a full-bodied rendition of the main theme in Carol Annes Theme (End Title), which has children singing along with the lullaby and whose laughter at the end of the piece gives the score an eerie lasting effect.

The album is an hour long and is a joy to listen to from start to finish.",1475798400,5

92261,8327,16847,"Porcupine Tree's STEVEN WILSON has transformed the back catalogues of King Crimson and Jethro Tull in the last five years with his meticulous and sensational digital transfers  not to mention Gentle Giant, XTC, Caravan, Emerson, Lake And Palmer and Hawkwind all benefitting from his even-handed yet sympathetic ear. Artists trust their work to this man precisely because he has a love for their complexity and the technical know-how to match his and their musical passions (Ian Anderson of Tull will have their music go nowhere else). But fans of England's best experimental band YES have been licking their lips in glee over this one  Progressive Rock's most ambitious and commercially successful adventure ever  the 4-sided double-album monster that was and still is ""Tales From Topographic Oceans"" (December 1973, Atlantic K 80001 in the UK - Atlantic SD 2-908 in the USA).

The net-blurbs tell us that the 'go to' man for Classic Rock Remixes has been working on ""Tales..."" for three years on and off. Well - it was worth every painstaking minute because our Stevie has wrenched absolute magic out of his aural trick bag once again. YES fans are going to have a Topographic coronary when they get a load of the fabulous audio  but I've docked the card-wrap a star for what I feel is the staggeringly unimaginative visual presentation especially after all that hype and such a long wait. Here is the revealing science of details and Linear Pulse Code Modulations (LPCM to You and I)...

UK released Friday, 7 October 2016  ""Tales From Topographic Oceans: Definitive Edition"" by YES comes in two forms - a 2CD/2DVD-A version and this - the 3CD/1BLU RAY version on Panegyric GYRBD80001 (Barcode 633367901026). It plays out as follows:

For such a prestigious release - I was expecting visual fireworks - but the outer box slipcase has the Roger Dean painting front cover artwork only and nothing on the rear - no details of any kind. Both the gatefold 2-disc cardholders are identical - even the booklet has the same artwork. Inside each card sleeve are the four discs - but they're housed in blank black card inners without any track details (theyre only in booklet). Where's the alternate Roger Dean artwork for the second card gatefold - or how about making the card inners interesting with tour posters - magazine advert campaigns - tape boxes - even the original Atlantic LP labels.

The first gatefold card sleeve with Disc 1 and 2 in it has the beautiful inner gatefold of the original 1973 double but the lyrics and explanations of the songwriting are barely readable and not featured in larger form in the booklet. The second card sleeve with Discs 3 and 4 has at least a live shot on the band on the inner gatefold and different RD artwork on the CD label - but that's it. The oversized 20-page booklet is a pleasant enough affair but large parts of it are taken up with just tracks-lists. Pages 2 and 3 show Steve Howe standing beside the massive American billboard advert for 'Tales From Topographic Oceans on Atlantic Records & Tapes' - but I've seen it before.

On the upside there's a nice collage of concert tickets - rare label variants from around the world peppering the text  shots of their stage show from the American tour and of course Steve Wilson's copious notes on the Audio Sources and how to get the best out of the BLU RAY's massive storage capacity. The SID SMITH liner notes (penned July 2016) are suitably informational and smartly written - but with all that visual repetition there's simply no oomph to the entire package - and not using alternate Roger Dean artwork somewhere seems like a very badly missed opportunity. I do like the BLU RAY menu that opens with the album cover in black and white that then slowly morphs into glorious colour on my 55"" tele with the Roger Dean 'YES' logo finally appearing as if by magic beneath the 'Topographic' LP title. And the choices within the three principal selections (2016 Mixes, Original Mixes and Audio Extras) are bewildering if not massively repetitive.

But at least all that underwhelming pales when you actually play the albums  the new 2016 Steven Wilson Stereo Mixes churning up details and clarity everywhere. I remember playing this dense 2LP beastie side to side back in the day  my poor worried parents concerned for their boy's sanity amidst all those synths and layered vocals and Sanskrit lyrics and his endless gawking at the encapsulated colour photos on the inner gatefold (more clouds - yum yum). Slagged off and beloved in equal measure  I've always thought of ""Tales..."" as breathtaking in its reach and this reissue only rams that home even more. That huge Wakeman synth solo during ""The Revealing Science Of God""  the sheer prettiness of Side 2's opening passage as they sing of '...velvet sailors...' and '...moments that start to linger...' - the adventurous percussive Side 3 with rattling cymbals and those manic rhythms where Howe's guitar does a Japanese hula-hula dance on your speakers - ending in my favourite part - the brilliant and varied ""Ritual"" - Squire making his Bass heard above all that Mellotron and that genius break into percussive chanting and then dancing - 'Nous Somme Du Soleil' indeed.

I hadn't expected much from the 'Studio Run-Through' Alternatives or a live version of ""Ritual"" - but how wrong can you be. When Howe goes into that solo at the end of ""Ritual"" he's ripping up and down the frets like a demented Robert Fripp and then it changes into that bizarre percussive section that sounds vaguely Chinese - in the live environment - it's explosive stuff and the bands playing virtuosity a thing of genuine wonder.

When I worked in Reckless Records in Soho  even the albums name would engender giggles and sighs of disbelief. The young ones would look at me corkscrewed when I told them of its lofty chart position  is he mad? Yes's ""Tales From Topographic Oceans"" went No. 1 in the UK on release in December 1973 and achieved No. 6 in the USA - incredible for such a challenging double and a music-form referred to as naff only two years later.

Time has proven the public right  and Steven Wilson has done this YES music a powerful justice. I just wish I wasn't so nonplussed by the visuals for something I loved so much (docked a star for that). Over to you...",1475884800,4

92308,16310,19021,"An absolutely gorgeous, haunting album!  I recently discovered Lisa Hannigan but was ambivalent about her earlier work--it clearly showed talent, but I wasn't sure if it was ""for me.""  This album, though, showcases her talent as it has developed into maturity, and has me utterly hooked.  The sound is beautifully fluid, full of eddies and flows, and somehow manages to be both modern and yet reminiscent of something of the Renaissance or even middle ages, particularly stand-out songs such as ""Lo.""  The lyrics and Hannigan's unique voice swim, drift, and drown, so that the effect is one of lying in the current and feeling it flow around you, as clouds float overhead--the listener is both drawn down and buoyed up.  A great find, and well, well worth a listen for fans of Irish, folk, and alt-folk music.",1475884800,5

I don't know how these guys keep coming up with song after song of heavy-hitting metal-infused electronica where each song brings something new. The only con is that when I listen to this in my car it makes me drive too fast. \m/

I'm not sure how this fits into the other music I like, but if you like synth with your metal you're going to love this. Give it a try! Then come back here and leave a review. These guys need to hear the love so they make tons more of this!",1475884800,5

92337,16453,17828,"This stuff is killer. I'm very picky about my electronica (and my metal) and this delivers so much it blows my mind. Thick beats, metal guitar solos, sweeping melodies, just wow. Never heard anything like it. And it's instrumental? How this holds my interest without vocals is beyond me, but it is THAT GOOD. The changes in the songs are what makes this so great. Every song is unique and identifiable and has its own vibe and soul and I can't get enough. Why are there not hundreds of reviews for this?",1475884800,5

Tina Kenny Jones) is one great song to help anyone realise their individuality and identity, with superb vocals and instrument arrangement.

92486,5355,14869,"I knew nothing of Canada-based singer-songwriter Neilson until two weeks ago when  at the large Americana Music Conference and Festival in Nashville, a friend suggested I see her showcase. There she was on stage with her retro-1950s hairdo and then she opened her moth. What a voice. At first she reminded me of Brittany Howard, the lead singer for the duo Alabama Shakes. But soon afterwards, she was channeling the sound most associated with Patsy Cline. I was hooked and needed to get her CD.

I was not disappointed and, if you love either of the women I mentioned above, I think you need to check Ms. Neilson out. Nearly all of the 11
All the songs were written  or co-written  by Neilson or Australian singer/songwriter Delaney Davidson (who I discovered at this years Folk Alliance Conference in Kansas City).

The packaging deserves mention as well. The disc comes in a trifold digipak with individual comments on each song printed inside. There is also a 6 page foldout insert with the lyrics. And all the words are in a typeface and font size you can actually read.

Try some samples and see if her voice impresses you. It sure did me. Im now a big Tami Neilson fan!
I hope this review is both informative and helpful.

The Blu-Ray disc retains the content of both DVD-As along with a plethora of extras, including the ""alternate"" album version, the five single edits, new stereo instrumental mixes of the album tracks and extended ""Dance Of The Dawn"" in DTS-HD Master Audio, and two ""needle-drop"" vinyl transfers; from the original UK LP pressing and the US banded promo LP pressing. Whew...!

TALES FROM TOPOGRAPHIC OCEANS, the group's sixth studio album, is considered by many the most controversial of the YES canon. Coming off the mega-selling CLOSE TO THE EDGE (#3US, #4UK), which featured just three tracks, including the side-long title cut, the band was blindsided by the departure of drummer Bill Bruford. Although an extremely gifted and popular member, Bruford was tired of the personal conflicts and the constant state of friction between him, singer Jon Anderson and bassist Chris Squire. When scouted by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/KING-CRIMSON/dp/B00065MDSG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">KING CRIMSON</a>&nbsp;honcho Robert Fripp, who was putting together a new version of the titular groundbreaking progressive group, Bruford quickly bailed. With a world tour on the horizon, the band settled on Alan White, mostly known for his work with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/PLASTIC-ONO-BAND/dp/B000002UT9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">PLASTIC ONO BAND</a>&nbsp;and on John Lennon's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/IMAGINE/dp/B003Y8YXFS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">IMAGINE</a>, who had three-days to rehearse (!) before the tour commenced (most of the content of the band's next release, the live&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/YESSONGS/dp/B000002J1Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">YESSONGS</a>&nbsp;were recorded on said tour). During a stop in Tokyo during the tour, Jon Anderson was inspired to write a four-part epic based on a lengthy footnote within the book '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Autobiography-Of-A-Yogi/dp/0876120796/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Autobiography Of A Yogi</a>' that described four ""shastras"" or treatises covering all aspects of religious and social life. Anderson approach guitarist Steve Howe with his idea, and when Howe agreed they began working on themes and instrumentation, conceiving the project as four side-long album tracks. Unfortunately keyboardist Rick Wakeman disagreed with the concept and musical direction, but agreed to finish the material, even though he considered it too avant-garde, bloated and padded. The songs were credited to Anderson and Howe, with music by YES. TALES FROM TOPOGRAPHIC OCEANS  was the first YES album to utilize 24-track recording, although they had numerous issues with the equipment. Wakeman found himself often bored and spent a lot of time in a nearby pub playing darts. He also contributed to BLACK SABBATH's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SABBATH-BLOODY-SABBATH/dp/B000002KET/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SABBATH BLOODY SABBATH</a>&nbsp;which was being recorded in an adjacent studio. A tour followed where the group performed the entire album live, which I'm proud to say I caught twice. Afterwards, Wakeman was the next to jump ship, onto a fairly successful solo career, rejoining YES on and off throughout the remaining years. Although panned by many critics, who held the album as an example of progressive-rock excess, it was a stunning commercial success. It was the first UK album to ""ship gold,"" and topped their charts for two weeks, in the US it made #6 and also certified gold (over 500,000 copies sold). The band toured behind the album from November 1973 to April 1974. The band also broke attendance records at the UK's Rainbow Theatre, selling out five consecutive nights, a rock band first.....

The set comes in two mini vinyl replica gatefold sleeves within a slipcase, at first the cover art looks the same on both, but on closer inspection the second has a subtle difference (I'll leave it for you to discover). The disc labels reproduce the record labels found in the original 2LP set, in both the original (Discs 1 & 2) and ""tweaked"" (Discs 3 & 4) versions. The booklet features new sleeve notes by Sid Smith along with portions of new interviews with Jon Anderson, Steve Howe and Alan White. Besides rare photos and archive material the original artwork has been expanded, restored and approved by long-time YES illustrator Roger Dean. My only complaint is the lack of easily readable lyrics. Either an expanded booklet, a separate lyric booklet, or a mini-poster of the original (and beautiful) inner jacket is sorely needed. As is you need a magnifying glass or your old LP to follow the lyrics, which are a major part of this masterwork, and enjoy the now minuscule inner artwork........

To quote Steven Wilson: ""I worked on and off for about 3 years on this new mix in my quest to do it justice. I hope it will satisfy the people who agree with me that it may just be Yes's pre-eminent masterpiece.""

As with RELAYER, another dense recording, the added surround, center and subwoofer channels open the compositions wider, helping the listener to discern parts and themes buried in the conventional two-channel mix-down. I wish they had included a surround version of the instrumental mixes found on the Blu-ray, although the listener can again discern more from the absence of vocals, a 5.1 mix would've been the icing on an already delicious platter. Mirroring their genesis, all the tracks are credited lyrically to Anderson/Howe, adding Squire to ""The Ancient / Giants Under The Sun."" The music is credited to the entire band as well as the track ""The Remembering / High The Memory."" Anderson and Howe felt TALES FROM TOPOGRAPHIC OCEANS to be innovative and breaking new ground, whereas the critics let loose, some calling it the death-knell of progressive rock. . It's arguable that the architect of the album's sound-palate this go-round is Howe, who's playing throughout is stellar. Even though he has spoken bout his distaste of the opus, Rick Wakeman devised many unique and daring keyboard passages, providing the ""glue"" so to say, that binds of the disparate parts. One of the pluses of Steven Wilson's remix is the liberation of Chris Squire's bass, which seemed lost most of the time in the original mix. Surprisingly the MVP award goes to the new kid, drummer Alan White. To be thrown into the maelstrom of a mega-popular band's tour on three days notice while facing the prospect of contributing and recording four side-long compositions must've seemed daunting indeed! White not only acquits himself with a rock-solid steady base underlying the music, he also contributed melodies, a bridge and piano on ""Ritual."" His finest moment however is leading the band during the astounding ""Ritual"" percussion break, the rarest of rock animals, a drum/percussion solo that's not boring. The two outtakes of ""Dance Of The Dawn,"" basically live in the studio run-throughs, are terrific as well, and best exemplify the talent, genius and innate musicality of the band called YES......

All said, the remastering is stellar, the remix will depend on individual tastes. As with his remix of RELAYER, Wilson brings forth many passages, sounds and nuances buried in the original mix. Is it better? Well, while the 2003 Rhino remaster was great, hearing this prog monster in surround sound is a whole other ballgame. Wilson's remixes/re-imaginings are always well done, you never sit there and think ""gee, this sounds lousy"" unless your a dyed-in-the-original-listened-to-it-2,000-times advocate for the original recording, which is also here as a ""flat transfer from the original tape source"" as well as needle-drops from the original UK LP and US Promo LP (the latter two Blu-Ray only).  I look on these YES remixes as a complimentary additions to the original recordings. Considering the length of TALES FROM TOPOGRAPHIC OCEANS and the breadth of extra material you would have to spend many, many hours listening to and comparing the different versions to note the exact differences. I say, take it on it's own merits, and enjoy! Fans will definitely be pleased, and those either new to the album or critical in the past will have to judge it's merits. Me? Well anyone who has read my review of FRAGILE will note that I was disappointed that TALES was not the next release after RELAYER. You'll have to excuse me, I'm dying for a second/third/fourth listen......

least we forget, the band:
Jon Anderson - lead vocals, harp, cymbals & percussion
Steve Howe - electric 6- & 12-strings, steel and acoustic guitars, electric sitar & backing vocals
Chris Squire - acoustic & electric basses, timpani & backing vocals
Rick Wakeman - grand piano, RMI Electra-Piano, MiniMoog, Mellotrons, Hammond C3 & pipe organs
Alan White - drums, piano (Track 4), vibes, Mini-Moog, Moog drum, tubular bells & assorted percussion

After the album release and tour Rick Wakeman (who on record has called the album ""padded and bloated"") decided to go solo with A&M Records who had been pursuing him ever since the success of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-SIX-WIVES-OF-HENRY-THE-VIII/dp/B00Q5V6RYG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE SIX WIVES OF HENRY THE VIII</a>&nbsp;(#7UK, #30US).  YES eventually chose Swiss keyboardist Patrick Moraz, late of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/REFUGEE/dp/B0043A0UW6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">REFUGEE</a>, as his replacement and released&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/RELAYER/dp/B00NAYYSS8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">RELAYER</a>, another successful (#5US, #4UK) a three-track but this round single-disc album. After they toured THAT album, the individual members all recorded solo albums, with Moraz  eventually escaping the dreaded psychological pressures of being a YES member. He later was off to a dozen-year stint with THE MOODY BLUES, only to be replaced by...Rick Wakeman! The reunited TOPOGRAPHIC OCEANS band recorded two albums, the back-to-basics&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/GOING-FOR-THE-ONE/dp/B00007LTIC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">GOING FOR THE ONE</a>&nbsp;(which is rumored next in line for the Steven Wilson magic ears remix) and the disappointing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TORMATO/dp/B00009Z574/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TORMATO</a>. As if the YES saga could get any stranger and complicated, Jon Anderson and Wakeman jumped ship, to be replaced by Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes, late of one-hit MTV-opening wonders THE BUGGLES.

92669,3161,9049,"What a find!  Wes Montgomery, the greatest jazz guitarist in history, is the one player whose style and ability crossed many genres, including blues, jazz and rock music.  For my money, only the equally brilliant Kenny Burrell stands on the same dais as far as jazz is concerned, with perhaps Charlie Christian taking up the first position for inventing modern day lead guitar work in the first place.  This is saying a lot, folks.
  There has been a lot of work done lately to unearth and release early Montgomery recordings and while the majority of the tunes on this double CD were taken from live performances in Indianapolis in the very late 1940's and early '50s, thus the rough sound, we see a side of Wes that offers a brilliant look into a young very fiery guitarist with a band that more than keeps up him.  The Johnson-Montgomery Group was possibly one of the hottest jazz quintets in bebop history.  Joining Wes was the stellar Pookie Johnson on saxophone, every bit the player some guy called Coltrane ever was, and the Montgomery brothers - Wes, Buddy and Monk.  Monk played bass, and Charles ""Buddy"" Montgomery is one of the greatest jazz piano players in history, easily matching the skill and style of Brubeck or any other jazz pianists out there.
  It is worth noting that in the midst of the Jim Crow era, that Indianapolis was close enough to the South to be a divided city like so many others.  The Turf Club was a popular jazz club on the NW Indianapolis side, not far from Speedway, the suburb that the famous race track calls home.  It was segregated, and only in special occasions were blacks allowed in if they weren't the entertainment.  The Johnson-Montgomery group had to sit back stage in a tiny room during set breaks.  How hateful and ironic it is that the music they played was brilliant, ground breaking and absolutely astonishing, while ignoramuses whom considered themselves so much superior to the band because they were white virtually ignored the band except in rare cases.  There are places where Wes played for black audiences, who got it, and you can hear on those occasions the calls to ""Make It Hot!"", meaning to request the band really get after it with lightning speed and precision.
  Here Wes and Co. happily complied.  While we have standards like ""After You've Gone"", an early reading of ""Wes' Tune"" and other chestnuts, they are all mindblowing, with the licks between Pookie, Buddy and Wes knocking off riffs at incredible tempos, the rhythm section keeping the beat going and fire blazing under their feet.  Montgomery would become more ballad oriented with time, becoming the eloquent master he was destined to be, but here we get fire with the slower numbers, and on the second disc some exceedingly rare cuts from some studio cuts in the long defunct Spire Records out of Fresno, California.  So quickly did this little label go belly up that any records still surviving for that label are collectors' items, and we are lucky to get some of them.
  The mastery of this collection can't be overstated, and it makes a very very good companion piece to 2014's ""Echoes of Indiana Ave."", the first older cut collection.  No self respecting guitarist regardless of style should be without this amazing CD.",1476230400,5
92670,6230,16425,"First off, this is an awesome live recording.  David really shines.  The quality of the pressings is excellent, very quiet and to make it unique, the discs are blue coloured.

92704,976,19317,"Great value-priced set, featuring 59 tracks by The Supremes - and yes, these are by the Motown Supremes.  The set itself is rather haphazardly compiled, with a wide array of tracks including both hits and even a few fairly deep album tracks.  There are also some alternate mixes and versions here; not just the original 45 or LP cuts.  Some may not notice that, but as a Supremes junkie, I do, and I love that different takes were used for a few songs.  The underlying fact of this set is that it contains some spectacular music, a lot of it, and at a splendid price.  The sound is actually very good for the most part; many tracks are mixed with a heavier bottom beat (bass and drums), which in my opinion, really brings the tracks alive.  One or two tracks are inferior in sound quality to previous releases, yet for the price, that can be overlooked.  Two discs of Diana and The Supremes and one disc of the post-Diana 70's group.",1476230400,5

92721,14316,2278,"Ever since I stumbled across Mark Ronson, I've been a huge fan of his albums.  Up to this point, what I've appreciated most is the variety of genres and styles presented on his albums while generally containing great, tasteful music--sort of like how I'd describe the selection of songs on my iPod.  What stood out to me about this album is it is the most coherent of his albums.  Even though he is using many different vocalists like on his other albums, this one has more of a concept feel to it.  Ironically, the biggest hit from this album and the track featuring Mystical are the biggest departures from the rest of the tunes, but they are also some of the best songs.  What I will call the theme hook for the album stuck with me right away.  I may be jumping the gun a bit with the five-star rating, but I have a feeling most of these songs will stand the test of time.",1476230400,5

92724,10648,16417,"Produced by the awesome Paul Brown, Mark Etheredge's latest album is a collection of some truly splendid tracks. Starting with ""Groovin With My Baby"", which is such a lovely romantic composition full of lightness and gladness of the heart, I was enchanted! ""Be Who You Are"" has a very catchy melody that is instantly likable....Mark's keyboard improvisations are great here :-). ""Roger That"" is a sophisticated sound of modern jazz; very, very entertaining with brilliant drums and brass section. ""Connected"" is a gorgeous composition, I was mesmerized by the melodic element of this track, that is so full of brightness and optimism :-). The saxophone and brass section  in ""Lost in the Shuffle"" lend it a nice, edgy air....I loved it! ""For Your Love(feat. Chuck Loeb)"" is another marvelous track with a lovely groove that is foot-tapping and relaxing at the same time. Fantastic guitar by Chuck Loeb shines through the track :-). The romance of ""Rain"" is incomparable, the slow rhythm, the very unobtrusive keyboard tones softly took me on a gentle journey...so lovely! Mark Etheredge has presented tracks of immense grace and positivity in this album, and the lovely compositions are very much going to be on my mind for a long while :-) :-) :-)",1476230400,5
92725,4417,18885,"This song is a classic TV Show theme song. It is about TRAVELING. Yeah, moving those cows hundreds of miles is indeed traveling.

Whether you are on a bicycle tour wearing a pair of earphones or luxury cruising is a new model convertible sportster; this song can lift the spirits. Listen to it. I dare you to not quiver at the thought of starting a road trip as you listen. Frankie Laine captured the cowboy and travel spirit. So whether you are cozy in an overstuffed armchair, pedaling against the wind with waving waves of grain alongside, or just slurping a Slurpy while as you crank up the AC on a 100 degree day, sing out loud, sing as if you really ARE moving those doggies out.

I've become a big fan of Tyler Farr in the last year and I am discovering that some of his best songs are actually buried in the middle of the albums and not plastered all over the radio.

92748,1108,12324,"I normally despise remakes of my favorite songs.  Invariably, they lose something of the charm of the original when updated and translated to a modern musician's style.  Whether it's Madonna remaking Don McLean's ""American Pie,"" Destiny's Child remaking Roberta Flack's ""Killing Me Softly With His Song,"" or the Dixie Chicks' remaking Fleetwood Mac's ""Landslide,"" it always feels to me like the new versions are little more than watered-down copies of the originals, annoying at best and downright soulless at worst.  So when a video of Simon and Garfunkle's classic ""Sound of Silence"" being performed by metal/rock band Disturbed began circulating on Facebook, I braced myself for the worst.  The only thing worse than a modern remake of ""Sound of Silence,"" I thought, would be a metal cover of it.

I was blown away.  No, Disturbed's version of ""Sound of Silence"" doesn't have the same tone and quiet thoughtfulness of Simon and Garfunkle's song.  But instead of giving us a weak copy, Disturbed gives us something powerful and resonant, a cover that is unique and excellent, even masterful, in its own right.

""Sound of Silence"" is a slow, melancholy ballad, but while S&G made it thoughtful and wistful, Disturbed infuses it with a great sense of sadness and even rage that slowly builds to an ultimately hopeful crescendo.  It makes for a haunting, yet in the end thrilling, listening experience.  The singer's voice struggles a bit with some of the higher notes but otherwise has a rich and even gorgeous tone, carrying a great deal of emotion as he sings.  And despite Disturbed being mostly known for harder stuff like metal and hard rock, they don't spoil this cover with unnecessary guitar riffs or drum-bashing -- the instrumentation is mostly subdued and provides haunting accompaniment, though it apes the singer by building to a thundering, powerful crescendo in the end.  A good song has singer and accompaniment working together rather than fighting one another, and ""Sound of Silence"" delivers.

Disturbed didn't change a single lyric of the song in the process of covering it, which I greatly appreciate.  Sometimes covers take advantage of the song they're remaking by altering the lyrics, and this rarely works out for the best in my mind.  Disturbed made a good call by keeping all the original lyrics in place -- their message of a society where people are afraid to speak out or listen to the ugly but necessary truth is still resonant today, and is a message that needs heard now more than ever.

I still love Simon and Garfunkle's version of this song... but Disturbed's cover is amazing, and one of the few song covers that I would call just as good as the original.  Disturbed takes a well-known and well-loved song and makes it their own without weakening it at all, and I highly recommend it even to those who aren't fond of the band or their style of music.  You won't be disappointed.",1476316800,5

92761,2664,19322,"8th album from this Austin, Texas band who play perceptively introspective songs that gather strength from Will Sheffs compellingly yearning & honest voice, coupled with his lyrical ability to capture poignant slice-of-life imagesand put it all together in sparse, slow-building musical arrangements that ring with the heart-stirring appeal of sadness, empathy and truth.  Occasional bits of jazzy orchestration are mixed into the overall Americana/folk feel.  Includes guest appearances from Marissa Nadler and Jonathan Meiburg (Shearwater).  Recalls artists/bands such as Craig Finn, Iron & Wine, Drive-By-Truckers, Bruce Springsteen, War On Drugs.  Away is a genuine slow-grower.  It may not be the first record you reach for, but once it starts to play, you won't want to break the mood.  Quietly riveting.",1476316800,4

92778,12631,18353,"In the early months of 1961 the pop music scene in America was pretty dreary. With instrumentals like Burt Kaempfert's ""Wonderland By Night"" and Lawrence Welk's ""Calcutta"" topping the charts American teenagers were casting about looking for exciting new sounds to latch on to. In February 1961 the New York based disc jockey Murray ""The K"" Kaufman secured a copy of a recording session tape made by an unknown Pittsburgh based doo-wop group called The Marcels. The group had just signed with the recently-launched Colpix label in NYC. What Murray the K heard that day was the wildest version of the Rogers & Hart standard ""Blue Moon"" that had ever been attempted to that point. He was positively captivated by the tune and without telling either the record company or the group he began playing it over and over again on his show. Realizing they had a huge hit on their hands Colpix rush-released the single in the final days of February, ""Blue Moon"" reached #1 in New York City in just one short week and was topping the charts nationwide inside of a month. ""Blue Moon"" continues to be one of the most beloved oldies of all-time.  This is the historic hit recording you would remember from the radio.",1476316800,5

92811,2664,18719,"2nd album from New York band who play high energy roots guitar rock that references blues, rockabilly & country with a link to raw indie chug-a-lug pop.  Its as much loosey-goosey fun as a 50s sock hop!  The songs feel pure and authentic; Jerry Furys vocals and songwriting are spot-on.  The lyricsabout love, heartache and life on the roadmeld perfectly with the bands tight approach to bar-room bop-rock.  Former members of We Are The Fury,  Head Automatica.  Recalls artists/bands like The Stray Cats, Flat Duo Jets, Dex Romweber, Two Wounded Birds, Buddy Holly.  Into the Night re-creates the feel of 50s style country rockabilly better than any album Ive heard in a long time.

92821,18,19326,"I recently saw Ivan Pongracic in concert (more on that later). Pongragic and Patrick OConnor are the driving force behind surf-rock band The Madeira, and these two divide up the songwriting credits pretty much evenly. The band has released a number of albums before, and this is their most recent one, from last year.

Ancient Winds (13 tracks; 43 min.) opens up with a furious Journey to the Center of the Surf, an entirely appropriate title for this song, like being dropped in the midst of a whipping storm. Hail, Poseidon! continues in that same vein. Coral Island i a surprise cover of the legendary Australian surf band The Atlantics. There are only 2 slower songs on here: the last track on Side A, Dawn in Cadiz, and likewise the last track on Side B, Into The Deep. The rest of the music is pretty much upbeat, if not outright fast-and-furious. But bottom line is that the band is in great form, and this is top-notch surf-rock, period.

As mentioned, I saw Ivan Pongracic recently in concert here in Cincinnati. He was playing with his side project The Troubadours (which includes Ivans dad--now a crisp 73 years young if you can believe it--on rhythm guitar, as well as the Madeiras Dane Carter on drums). They put on a fantastic 1 hour set playing covers of the legendary British instrumental band the Shadows. Its at that show where I picked up this CD. If you have the chance to catch either the Madeira or the Troubadours in concert, do not miss them! Meanwhile, Ancient Winds is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1476316800,4

Reminiscent of bands like The Strange Boys, Psychic Ills, Christian Bland & the Revelators, White Fence, The Black Angels, Velvet Underground.

92904,8609,10171,"Well, this is it, the seminal debut album of Hollywood Undead - Swan Songs.  I did not start here, though.  I only discovered HU through Day of the Dead, and then went back and collected all their other albums.  While I love all of them (I feel HUs quality across their works is very consistent), Ive noticed that I tend to listen to Day of the Dead and this album the most often.

Where do I start?  Well, theres a great variety of tracks on this debut album, ranging from party songs like Everywhere I go, to tracks like Undead and Paradise Lost that are harder-hitting.  All of them feature amazingly catchy backing instrumentals and choruses you can easily sing along to, along with a fair number of anthem-like themes of rebellion and discontent  perfect to get your blood pumping.  The only thing that originally gave me pause about this album is that it does seem to feature the least mature of their songs (which makes perfect sense given that this is their first release), but if you're willing to tolerate songs that contain the word weenie then its quite an enjoyable album.

Oh, and I must mention that I bought the physical cd, but I also suggest going to itunes and grabbing the extra bonus songs from the collectors edition.  They are well worth owning, in my opinion.

Overall, Id have to say that this album is among one of my favorites, period.  If you are HU fan, then Im sure you already own this, but if you arent, then this is as fine a place to start as any.  Of course, people with low tolerances for gangsta personas and songs with a bit of immaturity need not apply.  I, however, rarely find albums that I love every single song on and can honestly say contain no filler tracks, so I heartily recommend Swan Songs.",1476403200,5

But those 3 tracks that were recorded at the Beacon Theatre in NYC...WOW !!  They capture the power and energy that this band exudes on stage.

92912,8609,7177,"This is it!  This is the very first Hollywood Undead album that I ever discovered, and its the one that got me into their music in the first place!  I admittedly haven't been a fan for very long, but this album is the one that hooked me and got me to fall in love with HU, eventually causing me to go collect all their previous albums.

Having now experienced all their previous records, Day of the Dead feels like a good mixture of more light-hearted songs (like War Child) with more serious songs (Dark Places, Live Forever).  My particular favorite is How We Roll just because it is so high-energy and fun, plus I love the wordplay in the line, were packing heat because its cold out here  I also quite like the song Does Everybody in the World Have To Die for its slightly experimental-sounding backing music, along with the fascinating way the title phrase fluidly progresses from being a question to an affirmative statement.  Additionally, for anyone who misses Funny Mans deep, surprisingly sexy voice, youd better give Guzzle, Guzzle a listen (bonus song on the deluxe version).

Oh, and if you're wondering exactly which version to get (theres a normal deluxe version, an itunes bonus song version, and a version in Best Buy), definitely pick up the Best Buy version.  It comes with the regular deluxe tracks, but also the tracks Sing and F--- the World. While I do recommend you track down all the bonus songs if you can, Sing is absolutely the most beautiful song HU has yet released, so I strongly suggest you try to get the Best Buy version solely for that.  Even if you dont, though, Day of the Dead is still an excellent album in all respects, and any version of it is definitely worth owning.",1476403200,5

With Heart Aint Slippin  Griffin showcases the beautiful range of his voice. This song is also extremely well written and arranged.

Griffin hits the lower notes perfectly and I love the harmonies too :-) The Last Song left me with goose bumps, the singing is just about perfect and the lyrics are poignant and sarcastic at the same time.

92926,634,19341,"Prime Cuts: Heartbeat, Tremble, How Beautiful

The protocol these days is that most mega churches will get an offer to release a worship album.  Marketing research has demonstrated that if a mere 10% of such church attendees were to purchase a single copy of the release, the record company would have recuperated the album's cost.  And even if the album never sells a copy outside the church's walls, they still will not incur any loss.  All of this may work brilliantly as far as profit and loss statements are concerned, but they never do justice to the worship of our Almighty God.  Are all worship teams of huge churches capable of producing quality worship songs standing the test of time?  As a result of such a money-eyeing ploy, many talented worship leaders of smaller churches are sadly sidelined.  And what we end up is some ropey worship albums released by churches just because they meet the numbers quota.

Mosaic MSC's ""Glory and Wonder"" is grievously such an example. Mosaic MSC is the worship team of Mosaic Church in Los Angeles. The multi-site mega-church was founded by cultural pioneer and best-selling author Erwin McManus whose books have had been best sellers.  ""Glory and Wonder,"" the church's sophomore album, was recorded in front of a live, sold-out audience at their church home in the heart of Hollywood. Mosaic MSC represents the versatile sound of the city and growth of the church in worship expression.

With all the hype and hoopla aside, let's delve into ""Glory and Wonder.""  Basically, there are three major fault lines in this piece of sonic mosaic.  First and perhaps the most obvious, none of the songs here have melodies that catch the listener on the first or second or third or the tenth hearing.  Despite the slick and often polished production to guise the songs, the emperor still has no clothes.  The melodies are non-existent.  Unless you are part of the worship at Mosaic where you get drilled on these songs Sunday in and Sunday out, you might get some acquaintance with them.  However, if you are not part of the church, the songs sound so alike in tempo and melody that you feel like you are listening to a slow worship song that never ends.

Second, the lyrics of the songs are far too colloquial.  Many of the songs are essentially love songs to God.  ""Heartbeat"" for instance finds the team singing, ""I wanna know your heart... heart... Show me your heart...""There's nothing intrinsically wrong in relating to God in everyday language of love after all God has often revealed himself in Scripture as husband both to Israel and the Church.  Further, in many portions of the Hebrew prophetic books, we read of God expressing his love for Israel as a forlorn lover.  However, the Bible also speaks about God as transcendent and it also uses poetically rich and resplendent images for God. Why isn't this aspect reflected in the songs?  As a result of expressing God's love in a worship song as one would express human love in a love song, many of the songs here are as shallow as their titulars, ""Heartbeat,"" ""The One,"" ""Not Afraid,"" and so forth.

Third, worship songs need to canvass a gamut of theological themes mentioned in Scripture.  Most of the songs here hover around a small handful of themes, trust, worship, God's glory, and so forth. The songs keep recycling around the same few themes that one wonders if the songwriters are afraid of branching out or are they just mere lazy? Even when they deal with the issue of faith in ""Not Afraid,"" they never get deep enough in their lyrics to make the song affirming.  Perhaps, they would do better to craft their words more through the prism of Holy Writ than getting inspiration from love songs crafted by Taylor Swift or Justin Bieber.

Sorry to say, ""Glory and Wonder"" is what gives modern worship songs its tainted image that songs these days are repetitive, boring, and trite.",1476403200,2

92952,8609,14528,"I discovered Hollywood Undead with their recent Day of the Dead release (and fell in love with the music so much that I immediately went and bought their other main albums), so Im only just now going back and trying to collect their more obscure releases.  That brings me to this cd/dvd combo, Desperate Measures.  When I checked this out, the first thing I noticed was the rather poor average review score.  I was baffled by the negative reviews for this product...and while I don't think they are merited, Im now starting to understand why they exist.  The band released this directly after Swan Songs when everyone was excited for a new albumand then they got this instead.  This release is really more of a bonus thing (the sort of thing that bands don't usually put out until they have a few main albums under their belt), so I can understand why some people were disappointed.  Nonetheless, Im going to judge it purely on its merits, which will be easier for me since Im not coming into it with the same expectations as someone several years ago.

Disc 1 is a cd full of bonus songs: a mixture of original songs, covers, and some live tracks.  The first two original songs (Dove and Grenade, and Tear It Up) are great (and are among my favorite HU tracks), but El Urgencia is just okay, in my opinion.  The next couple songs are coversand they aren't exactly great (ugh, well, at least the HU boys seemed to be having some fun with it).  The last songs on the cd are live tracks, and they are pretty good; in fact, I rather enjoyed the live atmosphere of them.  It kinda makes me wish theyd release a full live album someday.  Oh, something odd to note (if you buy this on amazon) is that the mp3s being sold are actually the clean versionand there doesnt appear to be an explicit version of the mp3s being sold at all (as of the time of posting this review).  I have not been able to figure out why, but keep that in mind if you are like me and trying to get everything in its original, unaltered form.

Disc 2 is actually a dvd.  It contains live concert footage, and a few little interviews/extra bits (which are amusing) sprinkled throughout.  I was excited about having high quality concert recordings, but it feels like it was edited by someone with ADD.  The camera angle jumps around constantly, about every second, and it's a bit jarring to watch.  Still, its nice to have concert footage that wasn't filmed on someone's cell phone (and I eventually got used to the editing), so Im pleased to have this inclusion.  If nothing else, like the live tracks from Disc 1, this makes me yearn for a live album release.

Overall, this cd/dvd bundle is a bit of a mixed bag in terms of quality.  The original songs and live tracks are worth owning, but the covers are questionable.  The concert dvd is nice to have for the more hardcore fans, but I could understand why the casual fan might want to skip it.  I feel this item is worth owning, for me at least, since I'm happy to have some concert footage not filmed on a potato.  Also, as far as I know, this is the only official release containing live concert footage, and thus, it is now an important part of the historical record.  About 200 years from now when historians are studying Hollywood Undead, theyll be very grateful for this scrap of high-quality recordings.  If you are an HU fan and are considering picking this up, just keep in mind what it actually contains, and make an informed decision as to whether its worth it to you or not.",1476403200,4

Some are a little 'hokey' by today's standards, but I guess I'm a little picky about my gospel music.  There are a couple that are really good, fun to listen to.  I'm into the really 'feel good' Christian contemporary music, but I want a nice vocal sound as well.  This album is 'ok', but not fabulous.  But still, for what I paid, I did get a few really great songs.

Update:  Ok, I'm revising my first impression of this CD.  Although I still kept only about half of the songs on this album, after playing them all the way through, I realized that many of these songs are really great.  So, even if you keep only half of them, where else can you get 20 very good, inspiring and actually well performed Gospel songs for so little!  I am pumping up my 3 star to 4 star!  (I still can't give it 5 stars because of the fact I only kept 23 of the 40 songs.)  But someone else might not agree with me about the ones I deleted.

92996,12631,2808,"The group that later became The Miracles was formed in 1955 by five teenage friends from Detroit, Michigan, under the name The Five Chimes. Three of the founding members, Smokey Robinson, Pete Moore and Ronald White had been singing together since they each were around the age of eleven. The group, influenced by acts such as Billy Ward and His Dominoes and Nolan Strong & the Diablos, featured Clarence Dawson and James Grice in the original lineup. A chance meeting with with record producer Berry Gordy Jr. in 1957 would ultimately lead to a contract with Motown records. In addition, Smokey Robinson made major contributions to the success of Motown, a fact acknowledged by label founder Berry Gordy Jr., when he surprised the singer with a corporatevice president title in 1961.

During the 1960's the music of The Miracles would become a fixture on Top 40 radio. During that decade The Miracles would amass an impressive total of 24 Top 40 hits. One of the most influential and honored tunes The Miracles ever recorded was released as a single in July 1965. Looking back it hard to understand why ""The Tracks of My Tears"" never made it any higher than #16 on the Billboard Hot 100 pop chart. Oddly enough Johnny Rivers cover version just a couple of years later was a bigger hit.

It is reassuring to know that both the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and the Grammy Hall of Fame have seen fit to cite ""The Tracks of My Tears"" as one of the most influential songs in the history of rock and roll. Motown does not get any better than this.",1476489600,5

Call it dance music or pop music or electro-beat, or whatever you want, but this is incredibly good music. This band has a definite knack for writing songs that move both your feet and your heart. Truly, these songs bring a smile to my face and a skip in my step. And the lyrics get stuck in your head too. Maybe this music isn't considered ""deep enough"" or ""daring enough"" for the diehard alternative music crowd, but to those types I say: loosen up and just enjoy these tunes. And for certain this is VERY tuneful music. Well-crafted songs all sung by a singer with passion and sincerity. For my tastes, this is a winner on all counts!",1476489600,5

93006,16393,4618,"I must confessthis has been the hardest review to write. On one hand, I have a soul-deep passion for Steam Powered Giraffe (SPG). I believe (in a secular sense) in what they do, and have been blessed (in a spiritual sense) by their art and craft. The robots, the old, folk music (old folks music, maybe?), it all works for me.

On the other hand, this album is, well, awkward in places, tripping at times. The disorientation comes, of course, from the line-up change. With Erin Burk downgraded and The Jon flushed out of the band, SPG has lost half of their original act. They are the same band, but there has been a drastic change in the step and cadence of the creativity, and vocal harmonies. And it seems like this album shows the bad struggling to get their sea-legs, musically speaking.

The Spine's wailing on A Way into Your Heart causes me to cringe a bit. But I think that the worst stumble was Go, Spine, Go. Like the Beatles' song Ballad of John and Yoko, this is SPG singing to themselves, about some funny incident and inside humoreating pie and getting diarrhea in the middle of a show. I think it would have worked better as a hidden or bonus track.

Highlights are Rabbit's contributionsRust With You and Turn Back The Clock. She steals the show with her Freddy Mercury-esque vocals and soul-passionate communing with the music. Both of these songs are worth the price of the album.

I appreciate the slyness behind Mecto Amor and Hatch Fever. How do you explain the makeup changes? Well they sent us away for upgrades/And we return with a fresh coat of paint.

(Wait! Did they just use the word Upgrade?!)

Where did Hatchworth come from? Open the door/A human sized package ... All things explained, if not explained away.

One note. I like Samuel Luke: he has a good stage presence, he is a great songwriter and artist (he does some of the comics and did the cover for Quintessential). And his robo-persona is a treat: the violin-eque H&ouml;fner 500/1 bass guitar and his bowler with the exhaust vent (that reminds me of Frankenberry), and the Burnside sideburnsit all works for me. He looks like a Gilded Age mechanoid. His only drawback is that his mimes and motions are not as sharp as the Bennett's or Spragues'. Thus, some of the robot illusion is lost. But overall, Luke is a plus.

A Way into Your Heart Once you get past the blues wailing at the beginning, this is a catchy tune, the type we expect from SPG. The lyric, A way into your heart is an echo of Hatch Fever's, Open your heart to me. SPG is pleading with us to accept the changes in the group, and to accept them as they enter their 3rd reinvention of the group.

Really, this album's theme is about transitions: transitions to the new lineup, away from robo-mimes who sing, to singers who robo-mime; transitions away from life to death; transition from the 1800s to the 1950s and 1970s; and away from childhood to adulthood, and the need to move oneven if that entails a trip to the Vice Quadrant.

And Please Explain taps this fear we have of transition. Is there any meaning to seemingly random flux and jumble of life's eventsor to the changes in SPG? Maybe asking the question is the best we can do.

I like Ghost Grinder. It's a companion, or an echo , or a follow-up to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-2-Show/dp/B0086JZPNO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The 2 Show</a>&nbsp;Suspender Man. Ghost stories don't have to be like slasher movies or gateways into Satanism, and Rabbit returns us to the fun era of ghost stories, like Jerry Clower or Walt Disney's Sleepy Hollow cartoon.

She Said Maybe is another great love song by David Michael Bennett. It has the same bouncing backups like like That'll be the way home. And it represents the frustration some men experience with women. Sometimes they are like Tolkien's elves: Go not to the Elves for counsel, for they will say both no and yes.

The next two songs, Roller Skate King and Ill Rust With You, seem a bit out placethough Rust is a great stand-out single. One is a faux-disco, the latter is a faux-50's song. They continue the musical stylist survey, which began in the 2 Show with The Airheart triptych. That was 1940s Diesel Punk. Then we come to the 1950s and 1970s in our march through time.

I like these period pieces: they remind us that we are side-by-side with these robots. Their lengthy operational life and constant upgrades (that word again!) give us a soft taste of immortality. They are like Asimov's R. Daneel Olivaw: living, watching, and occasionally, keeping humanity on track. (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Forward-the-Foundation/dp/0553565079/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Forward the Foundation</a>)

Wired Wrong is a poignant, introspective song. And it's a good instance where SPG's robot metaphor works perfectly. A song like this would work well with many artistsimagine Britney Spears or Kanye West singing it. But having David Bennett singing this in makeup and with the jagged motionswell, it's a thousand times more effective.

Fancy Shoes is one of those songs with a great message, and the clinch-phrase Are you wearing them, or are they wearing you is one of those one-in-a-million ways of expressing things.

Steam Powered Giraffe (Reprise) Yes, this is Japanese, and go the band's website, and cut-and-past the text into a translator.
Turn Back the Clock and Bleak Horizon are great outros to this album, and set the stage for the three-part exploit into space: Music from Steamworld Heist, and The Vice Quadrant (1&2). The sentimentality in Turn Back the Clock, is movingprofoundly movingand the closing sounds in Bleak Horizon, the pulsing homing beacon reminds us that, though the robots have gone far away (be it from the African mecha-wars in the 1890s or their busking days in Balboa Park), they will come back someday. Come back home.

I'm devilishly attracted to this group. It's a fitting tribute to their tenacity that they have been able to keep their odd-ball troupe going for all of these years, and through all of their lineup changes and ebbs and flows of fortune.

In addition to their grit and gumption, what keeps their band going is a robust optimism. In addition to faith and love, hope is one of the commanding Christian virtues. And hope is what is needed in these bleak days of the cacophonous culture war.

The band's lore says that the robots were originally created to fight a war against mechanized elephants. In a sense, they were never mustered out, and the war goes on. In this era, they fight not against copper elephants, but depression and the oozing glumness that is washing over the hearts of humanity.

They are Col. Walter's 1st Infantry (Mechanized), and they fight with music.

We would do well to join them in their battle.",1476489600,4

the song is just short of a classic due to a few weak lines that don't fit well.  It's a bit too much of ""good lines I wrote down in my songwriter's

93032,16535,16847,"Tales is the last progressive artistically religious statement along with the song The Carpet Crawlers from The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway by Genesis.  I'm not sure that Disco or MTV ended the ambitious musical voyages of the late 60's and early to mid 70's. Probably corporate imaging of rock and roll (that would be MTV).  Just wait until the corporations get involved with the legalization of cannabis.  If you think the fun went out of music hold your bong hit. This remix mastered by Steven Wilson brings more justice to this masterpiece.  For me, Steven has brought every nuance to the forefront of the sound.  All these years later and I am startled by how different this music is from Yes's previous endeavors.  Wakeman shines despite his indifference to the music when Tales was released back in 1973.  Alan White's drum work is also prominent.  The bass of the late Chris Squire is groundbreaking.  Anderson is in form.  Steve Howe's guitar interplays more with the other instruments.  Artistically the best Yes album.  Thanks you Steven for the remix.  I know Chris is playing along.  Long live ambitious music.",1476489600,5

93065,10697,19358,"Christmas came early this year, thanks to Thomas Dausgaard, the Seattle Symphony, and what will almost surely become the definitive performance of the great Mahler 10th symphony.  - I have heard or own virtually all available recorded performances of this stupendous, if incomplete, symphony that I am aware of, and I have to say THIS ONE dwarfs all the others. It is a revelation!

I will spare you a long list of superlatives, other than to say that what Dausgaard has done here brings cohesion and life as in a sense occurred in the resuscitation of the biblical Lazarus, particularly by the reinvigorating of the three middle movements to support our being carried (as Dausgaard writes) and brought ""into [the] transcendental world."" The symphony is thus united from the famous opening Adagio through to the final apotheosis of the Finale, encapsulating the love theme first presented by the flute (and which arguably is the most beautiful melody Mahler ever wrote).

I need to finally add that the Seattle Symphony do themselves proud, particularly the brass, executing Dausgaard's most forceful and dynamic rhythms, so different from much of what we have heard from him previously when conducting smaller orchestras. There should be praise as well for sound engineers, Dmitry & Alexander Lipay, who do a fine job, even if we cannot hide our disappointment that they did not make use of DSD/SACD technology to deliver an even better sonic portrait of this sensational performance. Still...

All who love Mahler, should purchase this wonderful disc without delay.",1476489600,5

93073,56,17798,"2016 has been a banner year for Phil Collins. Musically, he has re-issued his entire catalog and released a lot of material for hard core and new Phil Collins fans. On his own, I have been constantly reminded of why singers today do not even have close enough to the sincerity of his songs at the soul. While many people have tried to cover a song of his, from Mariah Carey doing Against All Odds in 1999 to DMX with a take on In The Air Tonight, the songs that Collins made then have a much deeper place in the music industry today, because he let his heart speak for himself, and for when he was a part of Genesis. One of my favorite songs that Phil Collins recorded is Another Day In Paradise. The song really hits the nail on the head in regards to how the homeless are treated and abused in society, rather than people that seek a better future at the end of the light. The song speaks deeper volumes at the soul, than what today's music has been, cheap and poor at heart. Hard to believe that this song is more worth the money as time has firmly gone on, and definitely is worth the merit from the eyes of the world. Homelessness today is more of a problem today than it was back in the late 80's, and this song still shows the darkness they are treated by in the world. If you have never heard a Phil Collins song of his own before, well this is one song I absolutely recommend.

93220,7974,19367,"Suzanne Vegas recent album ""Lover, Beloved"" are studio recordings of the songs from her play Carson McCullers Talks About Love. Most of the music is written in collaboration with singer-songwriter Duncan Sheik, and part of the numbers are quite different from the usual Vegas folk-rock deposits.

Some songs are written in a blues / jazz style to better frame McCullers time 1917-67. Normally I'm not so fond of jazz and prefer this music in small doses. It works fine for this album, although my favorites mostly are the song similar to Vegas usual style.

Eg. ""We of Me"" is track that could easily have fit into Vegas excellent 2014 album ""Tales From the Realm of the Queen of Pentacles"". The song is quite catchy and could do just fine as a single  my favourite on the album. ""Carson's Last Supper"" is not essentially different from classical Vega, and also a musical highlight . Beautiful and moving is Annemarie and although the opening track ""Carson's Blues"" is rather jazz-influenced it has also become a favorite.

Lyrically it's an exciting album where Vega assumes to be the voice of McCullers, who, as mentioned on the cover, has been an inspiration for Vega since her teens.",1476662400,5

93256,16562,19336,"In recent years there has been an strong retro trend in music and among the leaders of this movement is the New Jersey label Daptone Records who does soul and funk the old fashioned way it used to be made, organic and with real instruments. This is their first venture into Jamaican music and Rocksteady. Those of us who like labels like Studio One or Treasure Isle and artists like Alton Ellis or Paragons should check out The Frightnrs. They formed in 2010 and hails from Queens, NY and has been locally active ever since. They released an ep (and some tunes) prior to Nothing to say which is their first full length album and my introduction to the group.

The album starts with All my tears a melancholic but energetic Rocksteady gem dealing with unlucky love. Its an amazing tune and its clear we are dealing with something very special. The voices are as smooth and silky as can be and the musicianship is on top. More heartaches are servedon track 3, Must find a way, im getting such a strong Alton Ellis vibe from this album. If we skip a few (genius) tracks things get a bit more upbeat on Trouble in here which is a bit faster and has a rudebwoy vibe with its non-descript threats of violence if someone does not get their act together.

One of my favorites on here is Til then which serves us more pain and broken hearts over semi-melancholic vibes. If you are slow and has not noticed it by now, this albums main theme is unlucky love. If Slim Smith where alive he would be proud of their tunes of emotional pain even though they don't feel quite as dark as he does. Every song is not about broken hearts though, Hey brother (do unto others) offers a break from the pain and suffering. In a perfect world this would be the track that made it to Radio as its a bit more lighthearted (without selling out) and has some very catchy organ play.

All in all this is an amazing album, I know I said earlier that The Viceroys released the album of the year but after this HUGE album its safe to say they share the first place with The Frightnrs, there is no way that anyone will top this album for the rest of the year. Its nice to see there is new bands going the traditional Jamaican route over a more punk oriented take on SKA and Rocksteady. Go and buy it NOW, that is an order!

In the late '50s into the '60s the folk music scene overflowed with talent including Dylan, Beaz, Peter,Paul and Mary to name just a few. By the mid-60s as Dylan shocked the folk music scene by playing an electric guitar at Newport, folk music itself would soon follow suite. ""Turn, Turn, Turn"" would become the most well known and loved song of the folk-rock movement. Performed by The Byrds, music written by Pete Seeger and the words from the book of Ecclesiastes combines for a memorable recording. Just an overall mesmerising performance that is still 50 years later relevant and important and will be, no doubt, that way for generations to come.",1476748800,5

I'm picky about recording and production, and to my 60-something ears, Single Lock is producing some of the most lovingly recorded and produced albums that I've heard in quite a while.  Label co-owner Ben Tanner (also the touring keyboardist for Alabama Shakes) has an ear for atmosphere, at times reminiscent to me of Daniel Lanois' work.

But after falling in love with this superb album, I'm eager to hear her other recordings also. As for this collaboration, the three ladies do a masterful job of sharing songwriting chores, and blending those angelic voices. It also helps that the songs are high quality compositions too. Some truly spine-tingling moments on tunes such as ""Atomic Number"", ""Honey and Smoke"", and ""Delirium."" But the poignant ""Song for Judee"" could be my favorite of the bunch.

93368,12631,7868,"It was a controversial song that dramatically changed the fortunes of both the man who wrote it and the young female singer who recorded it. Before he wrote ""Harper Valley P.T.A"" Tom T. Hall had been a travelling DJ and an aspiring songwriter trying to make ends meet on about $50.00 a week. Meanwhile, Jeannie C. Riley had dreamed of being a country music star since she was a little girl. After marrying her high school sweetheart Jeannie C. pulled up her Texas stakes and headed for Nashville. Believing he had a monster hit on his hands producer Shelby Singleton Jr. bided his time waiting for just the right voice to sing this tune about small-town hypocrisy. Singleton flipped when he heard the demo recorded by Jeannie C. Riley. Riley recorded the song in just one take and Singleton pushed the song into radio stations and record stores as quickly as possible. It was an instant smash. ""Harper Valley P.T.A."" song two million copies in just the first two weeks and wound up selling more than six million records. The single was honored by the Country Music Association as ""Single of the Year"" for 1968 while Riley won a Grammy for Country Female Vocalist of the year.  This is the original hit recording you would remember from the radio.",1476835200,4

93372,1909,19358,"I whole-heartedly endorse the previous reviews of this splendid live recording, which is very fleet and propulsive but manages to confer a real sense of unity and purpose on what remains a neglected work and surely a worthy companion to Mahler's other ""farewell"" symphonies, the Ninth and ""Das Lied von der Erde"" (a vocal symphony in all but name). It shares their valedictory and, ultimately, transcendent narrative and confirms Deryck Cooke's completion as both the most satisfying version and, for all the understandable hedging by those who attempt that daunting task but wish to avoid hubris, an entity which surely can stand as a fair representation of Mahler's intent, even if we obviously do not how he might have gone on to refine it.

Having just reviewed and very much enjoyed Yoel Gamzou's elaboration, I still prefer the Cooke version above all, as it is sparer and leaner and surely more in keeping with the direction Mahler's music was taking when he died. The Carpenter, Samale-Mazzuca and Barshai completions are certainly of great value and interest but this remains the best option for hearing what is fast becoming my favourite Mahler symphony, for all that I love the First, the Fifth and the Sixth.

The sound of this recording, compiled from three live performances in the superb acoustic of the S.Mark Taper Auditorium (what a mouthful) in Seattle, is excellent - as long as you a) don't mind the fact that it is not SACD; personally I couldn't care less and, b) accept that the engineers have gone for an aural landscape which more accurately reflects the ambiance heard by a listener sitting way up and way back in the hall. I do not mean this as a criticism; it is very naturalistic and reflects my preference for cheaper seats with a more spacious and reverberant acoustic - and there is certainly no lack of detail or obscuring of dynamic gradation, whose range is very wide but always audible. From the very first notes, the eerie, disembodied sound of the violas' keening immediately marks out this recording as something special.

Despite its speed, the whole performance is finely judged and moulded and Dausgaard is not afraid of extremes: the grotesque, prancing dance of the third them to be introduced in the first movement is wonderfully sharp; the soaring chorale with its wide, leaping intervals is very broadly played and the appearance of the famous nine-note scream in both the first and last movements never fails to give me goosebumps. The first Scherzo is swift, flexible and full of nostalgic Mahlerian-Alpine swing; the Purgatorio is played hard and fast to suggest how its restless, faux-naf jollity conceals a nasty edge; he second Scherzo is very free and expressive, penetrating generously applied rubato with some really crisp and unified orchestral ensemble, its release bringing out the grotesquerie of the music.

The finale is introduced with a really loud, sharp thwack on the bass drum that jolts the listener out of his seat as the shrieking chord does. The solo flute is coolly and hauntingly beautiful, then the stuttering central theme gives way to a serene trumpet solo before a rapt coda of great intensity and concentration; this is playing of the highest order.

I'm not sure I much like the prescriptiveness of Thomas Dausgaard's psychological narrative in his note, tracing the musical development of the symphony by closely matching it to the distressing events of Mahler's personal crisis whereby he made Alma choose between him and Walter Gropius but I cannot argue with the result; this has a strong claim to being the best Cooke version on record, even if I am not going to jettison Ormandy, Rattle (first recording) et al.

They have an amazing ability to blend pop, country and rock melodies and rhythms. Unlike many other bands that attempt this, they maintain a cohesiveness of personality that doesn't disintegrate into a hodge-podge of cacophony. Listening to this album is like watching a high-wire performer, trying to walk between two skyscrapers, and being amazed and astounded when they pull off the feat.

93383,7479,19380,"I've lost track of Eric Hansen over the years, but I'm delighted that he's back with a new CD dubbed ""Glistening"", and his talent shines through on this one for sure!  I first heard Hansen at a music kiosk in Barnes & Noble way-back in 2001, and was immediately taken with his ""Without Words"" album.  Then bought, his subsequent CD's when they came-out.  Hansen has always been labeled as a 'World Music' artist, and it seems to be the most accurate description regarding his musical-style of being both 'Smooth Jazz', or 'Neo-Flamenco' guitar orientation.  There's some really wonderfully atmospheric tunes abound ['Silverlight', and 'Red Rock Crossing'] on this newest offering.  I'm really digging his rendition of 'Aviles Street', absolutely top-notch fret-board work here.  'La Noche Burmosa' is yet, another a great piece, and every bit as good as a Strunz and Farah cut.  On 'Rumba Extrema' he dazzles just like contemporaries Jim Stubblefield, or Marc Antoine.  This is a very elegant, and sophisticated outing for Hansen, if you really listen to it.  I recommend this CD for fans of Benise, Roman Street, Al Marconi, Strunz & Farah, and Jesse Cook.",1476835200,5

93389,7245,19381,"October 2016: Re-Released on Concord Records (who this week released Melissa Etheridge's ode to STAX Records as a Stax release), The Traveling Wilburys Volumes 1 and 3 have finally gotten a remaster well deserved (for those of you who might be too young or too clueless, there was never a Volume 2, it was a joke to release 1 and then 3).  This review is for both volumes and posted to each in hopes that the buyer of one will want the other consequently.

Four of the greatest recording artists ever had, over a period of evolving years, developed fast friendships and recording assists with each other.  George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, Bob Dylan, and Tom Petty were, in 1988, the elite cream of the music industry.  All of them had worked with each other in a couple degrees of separation that brought them together when George was needing to record a B-Side single (which ended up being the leadoff single for the Wilburys (Handle With Care).  Orbison was in the Studio with Lynne (recording his Mystery Girl album) and George asked them both to join him, then they dropped in on Dylan to use his studio, and George stopped by Tom's to pick up one of his guitars.  Accidents happen and sometimes they are happy ones and sometimes they are astonishing epic moments.  I do not believe there has been a more monumental ""super group"" than this one, ever.  For the next couple years, Wilburys or solo records from these artists will include cameos or even full album assists between the members.  Unfortunately for history, the Great Roy Orbison died only a month after Volume I was released.  It would be a sad couple of years before the party reconvened for Volume 3, and though not as tight as the first effort, it is well worth a place on your music shelf.

The rest is history, the remaining four continued to make appearances in each other's works but despite hopeful rumors, another Wilbury album never appeared, even after Jeff Lynne became a ""5th Beatle"" during the '95 sessions to produce The Beatles Anthology series.  Wilbury albums (vinyl and CDs) went out of print after the initial runs so if you had a vinyl that got worn, it would be 2007 before you could buy a single disc CD containing both albums (thank you Rhino as usual).  Cut to 2016 and now both original records have been re-released on CD with some bonus tracks, new liner notes, and nice remastering.

The Traveling Wilburys as a group title was a fun joke for all five, wherein they assumed new ""identities"" in a very corny but whimsical manner, but the tracks they recorded are awesome collaborations, sometimes multivocal leads, sometimes single with harmonies from the others.  On both albums the songs are catchy, relatable, and none of them have aged badly.  You get a real sense of the blending of Beatles, ELO, Dylan, Heartbreakers, and of course the incomparable Orbison; it is a magic made in Heaven for classic rock fans.  Since all five members had guitars and keyboards talent between them a shout out has to go to Jim Keltner and Ray Cooper for providing percussion extraordinaire, and who supplied the bottom is a deep mystery but probably the multi-talented Lynne.  If two Wilbury volumes doesn't fill your cup, the only other way to add more than a few drops is to scrape around for Cloud Nine (Harrison), Oh Mercy (Dylan), Full Moon Fever (Petty), Mystery Girl (Orbison), and Armchair Theatre (Lynne), where you will find some or more than some collaborations betwixt the mates (except on Oh Mercy which simply benefits from Wilbury inspiration).

Noteworthy: (Volume 1) Handle With Care (George and Wilburys), Rattled (Jeff and Wilburys), Not Alone Anymore (Roy and Wilburys), Margarita (Wilburys), Tweeter & The Monkey Man (Bob and Wilburys), End Of The Line (Wilburys); (Volume 3) Cool Dry Place (Tom and Wilburys), Wilbury Twist (Wilburys).  Volume 3 is heavily dominated by Petty and Lynne, by which if you are a fan of Full Moon Fever and Great Wide Open, here's your chance to binge some more.  Volume 1 is decidedly more even by critical and fan standards, and has the best representation of the super group unit, but V3 should never be left out in the cold as it is a worthy brother and companion and needs your warm affection.",1476835200,5

93402,3202,16629,"There comes a time when musical humor grows tiresome. After 30 years of making humorous albums TMBG just seem to spin their wheels now. Don't get me wrong, I like them, have all of their albums, but it's just not the same anymore. They're not fresh anymore. I hardly pay attention now, and that's something I used to do with ""Lincoln"", ""Flood"" and ""Apollo 18"". Heck, even ""Mink Car"". And, sure, ""Nanobots"" was pretty good, a strong turn around, but overall, since 2001's ""Mink Car"", the guys have felt stale. They need something new. You know, Franz Ferdinand collaborated with Sparks last year to great effect. It was completely unexpected, and strangely, it worked very well. Perhaps that's what TMBG need. To collaborate with an unusual artist that we fans would never suspect. You know it would be interesting. More interesting than ""Phone Power"".

""Phone Power"" is yet another collection of oddballs, this time from dial-a-song, but it just falls flat. It's just okay, nothing more. I used to get excited about TMBG. I used to want to memorize their quirky lyrics, but now, not so much. They need a kick in the pants. Stop doing children's music, you've diluted your effectiveness. Collaborate. Yes, collaboration is now called for. You've exhausted everything else.

Here's how ""Phone Power"" compares to previous TMBG works:

1986 They Might Be Giants: Four Stars
1988 Lincoln: Four and a Half Stars
1990 Flood: Five Stars
1992 Apollo 18: Four Stars
1994 John Henry: Two and a Half Stars
1996 Factory Showroom: Three and a Half Stars
1999 Long Tall Weekend: Three and a Half Stars
2001 Mink Car: Four Stars

2005 Here Comes The ABC's: Four Stars
2007 The Else: Three and a Half Stars

2009 Here Comes Science: Four Stars
2011 Join Us: Three Stars
2013 Nanobots: Four Stars
2015 Glean: Three Stars
2015 Why?: Three Stars
2016 Phone Power: Three Stars",1476835200,3

Saw them live 3 times and this 3rd time, about July 2016, they'd added a 2nd guitarist and the sound was just incredible, lively and just jumpin' off the page compared to their studio releases.  This album reminds me of more songs cranked out by song writers who haven't really found something new or solid or substantial to release.

A national anthem for environmental consciousness, written by a man who happened to be black but whose vision is still guiding us.

Maybe ""Symphony"" was an attempt to get some MTV time but that's hardly the case with the rest of the album. I don't do track by track reviews because its all a matter of opinion but there isn't a weak one here. With the second disc of a complete live show this version is the way to go if buying this one.

He, like so many other relatively unknowns in this genre is simply put ""brilliant"" in every way. Original compositions and arrangements, great hot lick and laid back blues guitar chops and of course the man can sing all to the accompaniment of excellent and very experienced sidemen of the same persuasion! Go listen to some samples here on Amazon and see what I'm talkin' 'bout, brudder!

93539,1751,19195,"The Drive-By Truckers have been energized in opposition to racism in America.  This is a powerful album, both lyrically and musically.

The Truckers' music is not as rowdy and rocking as it was in the time of Decoration Day (2003) and The Dirty South (2004) -- the band has matured and grown more reflective.  Patterson Hood wrote and sings six songs, and Mike Cooley wrote and sings five songs.  The Stonesy rockers are, as usual, provided by Mike Cooley:  ""Ramon Casiano"" and ""Surrender Under Protest,"" which address immigration, the NRA, the Civil War, and the Confederate flag.  Cooley's songs also deal with hypocritical right-wing preachers (Kinky Hypocrite) and Clear Channel's ban on its radio stations playing ""Imagine"" in late 2001 (Once They Banned Imagine).

Hood sings about race and the police in the anguished ""What It Means?,"" the emotional center of the album, as well as gun violence (Guns of Umpqua).  ""Ever South"" is an epic tale of the immigration of the Scots-Irish to the U.S., to the South, and Hood's own continued move West to Portland, Oregon.  He embraces his new home in ""Sun Don't Shine.""  In short, the band continues to speak, as it always has, from the standpoint of white Southerners critical of the prevailing culture of white Southerners.

In the wake of Bob Dylan winning the Nobel Prize for Literature, we can be thankful that Dylan blazed the trail for other songwriters to create songs at a high level of artistry like Hood and Cooley.

I just saw them live for the first time 11/19/16 in Atlanta with their Black Lives Matter sign on stage -- great concert!",1476921600,5

This song has been used in at least 3 major films and its prominence is well-deserved.  For anyone who has thought that VM is similar to Leonard Cohen or Zimmerman, try this.

93550,1266,19393,"Ok, 5 stars.  All but one of the Woodstock songs.  Why hold out on one?  Remaster of studio lst lp I think I can tell the difference.  Great to have almost all of the Woodstock set in one place and why not with their lst lp which I think had just come out before Woodstock if I remember correctly.  I'm glad I bought this as I've tried to track down their Woodstock set over the years and haven't really been able to do so successfully.  Nice release.  Any Santana would love it as the Woodstock set just jumps off the record as a lively live set and this lst lp, along with their 2nd and 3rd albums (Santana ll and lll I guess), as most folks know, they had that magic combo of musicians for those 3 lps and the 3 of them really are the best Santana releases ever.  Scientifically proven.  Well, ok, I'm kiddin', but you can see they just got the groove right and the distribution of sound from among this set of musicians.  The previously officially unreleased non lp tracks never have been that great and still aren't but they flesh out that time period of released tracks from them.",1476921600,5

""Living in a Dream"" is a soothing, calm track that sounds as dreamy as its title :-). I loved ""Pixie's Dance"" with its delicate and nuanced tune and the high notes os piano makes it all the more charming. ""Seasons Change"" is a gently transitioning melody, much like the nature around us :-). I also loved ""Ocean of Tears"", this is a very moving composition. Lynn Tredeau brings a  gently delightful quality to all her compositions that provide that much needed tranquility to the mind :-) :-) :-)",1476921600,5
93553,3566,19057,"Herb Alpert's Summertime now on remastered cd, released around 1971, is a collection of previous ,shelved arrangement's after he disbanded  the Tjb, in 1969. Recent cover's like Gordon Lightfoot, "" If you could read my mind""  and Jerusalem , he used a lot of the LA wrecking crew, along with his former TJB member's Julius Wechter(Marimba and Vibes and trombonist Bob Edmondson,. Most selections are kind laid back, especially Perry Como's Catch a falling star and the rousing close Strike up the Band, also featured "" Summertime featuring his then girlfriend now wife Lani Hall and the poignant arrangement, Jerusalem. Very enjoyable, but noticed it wasn't vibrant jazzy sounding like his previous recordings,ina  few years Herb would reinvent himself as a jazz man, new dramatic sounds and still going strong with his vibrant group in 2015.

93652,10607,16847,"This follow up to the enormously successful Close To The Edge was fraught with conflicts and enormous inspirations.  Composed of lead singer Jon Anderson, guitarist Steve Howe, Bassist Chris Squire, multiple keyboardist Rick Wakeman and drummer Alan White and recorded in the countryside, it was intended to be a concept album.  Indeed, despite the varying degrees of accolades and dismissals, the album still did very well.  It was at least an opportunity for the five artists to explore and expand their talents at length over the course of the album.  All had great solo opportunities.

Now re-released in this four CD package, it covers all the bases  more than I have seen in any other collection to date.  Thanks to Steve Wilson, there is a 5.1 surround sound  remaster of the entire album in three formats.  DTS is the most common/popular and if any album was meant to showcase the talent in surround, this was one of them.  Its like being in the studio.  I love this album but going through a point-by-point analysis would prove nothing other than I love this album.  Instead, here are some of the goodies you get in this 2-CD collection.

CD One  2016 Stereo Mixes

CD Two  2016 Stereo Mixes and Alternate Album

CD Three  Alternate Album and Single Edits

Blu-ray Disc  Alternate Takes (LPCM Stereo 24-bit/96kHz)

Blu-ray Disc  2016 Stereo Singles Edits (LPCM Stereo 24-bit/96kHz)

Blu-ray Disc  2016 Stereo Instrumental Mixes (LPCM Stereo 24-bit/96kHz)

Blu-ray Disc  UK Vinyl Needle-Drop Transfer (LPCM Stereo 24-bit/96kHz)

Blu-ray Disc  US Banded Promo Vinyl Needle-Drop Transfer (LPCM Stereo 24-bit/96kHz)

All the sleeves are black and there is a great liner note leaflet.  It contains information about about the various sources and the reasons behind them which is very helpful for audiophiles.  Sid Smith gives a lengthy expose on the album in generl and it provides some interesting insights.  The photos are there as well from that period.  At the beginning is a Definitive Edition Blu-ray Disc listing (like the one above).  Just the sheer quantity and quality on this set is fantastic.  I am glad its finally available.

NOTE:  I am unable to transfer these songs (other than Blu-ray) to my iPhone.  Any help?",1477094400,5

She is truly a raw talent with a unique sound! She is truly an unsung talent! She's starting to catch on... This new entry is greater than the first 2. To understand the growth and talent of this artist you must buy all 3 CD's. It's like a trilogy and you must start from the beginning. Not sure where she came from but I'm glad she's here!

I do like the music, but I think that it would have gone better had it been on the end of disc 2 of their wonderful double album, a first for them.  Night Castle is a very good album, and I got great visuals through my imagination while listening to the music and songs, therefore I give this album 4 stars out of 5 for being an extremely likable double album.",1477094400,4

93750,145,19412,"For my money, this was better than her wonderful 2005 debut, more polished with a larger number of interesting songs. Particular fave: the wistful ""In the Moonlight,"" with its gorgeous hook that creates a magical scene. Another great song--""Winter."" Then, there's ""I do,"" and ""Love is on the Way."" Love that ""Carry me back"" verse from Love is on the Way. There's not a dog in the bunch. I love the occasional hint of gravel and gruffness in her voice on some songs. The delicate melodies are lovely, but don't think the sound is just background music: It catches your attention and makes you listen. You fall into the mood she creates.

""Waters of Acadia"" have the piano that flows and frolics like water over stones :-). ""Shenandoah Stillness"" is a perfect track of alone-ness....the splendor of the landscape comes alive with the guitar's superlative performance. ""Mariposa Sanctuary"" is an exceedingly beautiful melody that is utterly delicate and pretty :-). Another track I absolutely loved listening to is ""Sunrift Gorge"", its like being on a journey through vast countrysides uninhabited by man....the wilderness is so beautifully portrayed.

Of all the contestants that has ever entered or won The Voice, Jordan is mine and my wifes favorite singer. You know that Jordan is a great vocalist when this album debut on the Billboard Top 200 Album list at number 2.  This album has such great tracks as Stand In The Light, You Are So Beautiful (previously recorded by Joe Cocker), And So It Goes (previously recorded by Billy Joel), Over The Rainbow, Beautiful and many more.

The title track for example, is one extraordinary performance. This  is music that is ultimately enthralling and rewarding! I loved this piece as well as ""Hika, In Memorium Toru Takemitsu""...what a superb piece! ""Equinox"" with its harmonies is a poetic piece, the delicacy of the guitar strum really impressed me. ""Sui-Ho"" is a more surreal composition of eerily beautiful chords. The tracks in this album are all individually pleasing and memorable.

94002,12631,7416,"They rose to the top of the pop music world virtually overnight! This talented quintet, originally known as The Versatiles, formed in Los Angeles in 1966 and within a year they had secured a recording contract with Johnny Rivers' fledgling Soul City label. Rivers loved the sound but hated their name and as a result group member Ron Townsend came up with the name we would all come to know so well...The 5th Dimension. And it did not take very long for the group to make its presence felt. Their very first release ""Go Where You Wanna Go"" cracked the Billboard Top 20. Just five months later the group would score a major hit with Jimmy Webb's ""Up Up and Away"". Yes, the 5th Dimension was on its way! Over the next six years the group would prove to be a dominant force in American popular music amassing a total of nearly 30 charted singles and a dozen hit albums.

Over the years the 5th Dimension recorded a number of tunes by the noted American songwriter, singer and pianist Laura Nyro. In September 1969 Soul City records released ""Wedding Bell Blues"" a tune that Nyro had originally recorded in 1966. The song zoomed to the top of the charts and stayed there for three big weeks. It was the group's second biggest single of all-time. This is the original hit recording that has been remastered for your enjoyment.  Simply outstanding!",1477353600,5

94008,56,11479,"When it has came down to Michael Jackson, musically he had always been recognized as one of the greatest entertainers in the world. But the 1990's have been more rough for him personally, and in most cases, it did help to lead to his own death in 2009. While he did set the world on fire with Dangerous, but the allegations of him being a pedophile. Michael did weather the storm, but sadly his heart gave out at the end. But when I do think of his songs from the 1990's, there were very few that were sincerely heartwarming at the soul. Will You Be There was one of his very few songs that really spoke to a huge heart. The song which originally appeared on Dangerous at the beginning, but was a massive hit later thanks to the movie Free Willy. The song definitely is one of Michael's most soulful and intimate tracks that hinges with the depths of gospel and soul. It really was a song that lit true at the soul, when his darkest hours were rising. The song is definitely his best movie song, where the 90's really were a phoenix with music and film. What Whitney Houston had with I Will Always Love You, Michael Jackson had with Will You Be There. This is one song I recommend you download.

94014,56,11496,"It is honestly so sad that whenever someone young and talented has died at a early age. The shock of the death of Pete Burns has been deviating, but not a real surprised. He really was one of the most driven artists that had been more known as a one-hit wonder, than having massive success beyond the 80's. But also, his death was from the years of drugs and plastic surgery and him becoming a transvestite, becoming a man and being a woman at the end of the day. But nevertheless, he will always be known for just one song. That is how his friends and fans want to remember him and Dead Or Alive. You Spin Me Round (Like A Record) remains one of the most driven anthems to have ever came out of the 80's, in excess but also at heart as well. It has been one of those songs worthwhile at spirit, but also shows just how strong the 80's anthems ignite today, more than almost all of the artists that have ever came out with a album. But anyway, this is how Pete Burns should be remembered, as a fad, but as a strong example of what music was like in the era of excess.

Thoroughly dug the eighteen-minute rocking opener ""Mona"", the twenty-seven (almost exhausting) Bo Diddley staple ""Who Do You Love?"", the Dale Hawkin's 1957 classic oldie ""Suzie Q"" and the Dino Vanenti-penned ""Stand By Me"". Also have to mention one I'm not all that familiar with - the well-written ""I Get In Trouble"". Duration: 71:39.

94035,12631,8125,"In the 1960's Motown billed itself as ""The Sound of Young America"". It most certainly was. A young Detroit entrepreneur named Berry Gordy Jr. decided that he was going to start his own record company. His idea was a simple one really. He was going to make records with black artists that appealed to the largest segment of the record buying public which in those days was suburban white teenagers. His formula worked to perfection.

Among the first artists signed to Gordy's fledgling Motown label was a 17 year old R&B singer from Detroit named Mary Wells. Hearing about this exciting new enterprise Wells approached Berry Gordy Jr. with a tune she had written for Jackie Wilson called ""Bye Bye Baby: Gordy was duly impressed and immediately signed her to Motown. Within just a year she had her first charted single.

In July 1962 Motown released ""You Beat Me to the Punch"". The song would become Mary's second Top Ten hit peaking at #9 on the Billboard Hot 100 Singles chart. Looking back, Mary Wells really was Motown's very first star performer. Nice tune!",1477353600,4

94049,2674,17857,"Well, what can I say about this superb album that other reviewers haven't already written: this one is pretty much faultless. And that's certainly no surprise, seeing as how William Bell is singing these songs. The only real surprise is that it's taken him so long to make his ""comeback"" album. But, as they say, better late than never, and fans of good old southern soul will eat this one up!

Bell has astutely chosen some very talented people to co-write the songs with him for this album, luminaries such as Rosanne Cash, Marc Cohn, and John Leventhal (Rosanne's husband). He also covers a Jesse Winchester song, ""All Your Stories,"" that sounds like it was made to order for him. From the striking opening track, ""The Three of Me"" to the poignant closer, ""People Want To Go Home,"" this album is polished and smooth, but also powerful and gritty when it needs to be. Mr. Bell hits all the right notes on this splendidly soulful album!

94100,1805,18219,"Ive gotta admit that after La Gargola, which probably became my favorite Chevelle release, I was anxious for what The North Corridor was going to bring. My anticipation turned to disappointment upon my first listen. There was far too much CLONG-CLONGCLONG-CLONG-CLONG bass and Petes singcreaming stripped songs of any nuance. After a few more listens I can say that TNC has grown on me, but not much. The album is a blisterer and the nuances are there but they're buried pretty good. The overbearing power chords, punk rock drums, the monotonous bass lines, and that singcreaming! It beats you over the head pretty relentlessly. Its Chevelle, tightly wound. I like it when they're a little looser, allow some quieter moments to carry you into heavier moments, focus on some longer melodies, and have Pete screaming a lot less. If I was grading this after the first listen it would have been a 2 star, leaning toward 1. After listening to it a few more times over a few different speaker systems I can appreciate the music more, I certainly hear more of second guitar lines that imbue the songs with that much more interest (like on Young Wicked) but its simply not all that prominent throughout this release, and the music creeps my rating up to a 3 star but the singcreaming just ruins it altogether this time around. All in all a still disappointing 2.5 stars. I won't be listening to this one much.",1477440000,2

94136,6894,19436,"No man steps twice into the same river but Danny B, Sausage King of the Realm, has thrice so at Bruckner. Hes the first luminary to do so. If the Grim Reaper is more patient than usual, who can doubt that a fourth cycle will be forthcoming  and to what vivid end, dare one ask?

This traversal with the Staatskapelle Berlin is hewn from a series of live concerts. One either acquires it as a download (as I have) or as DVD where the sheer spectacle of the event is lure in itself. DBs second cycle with the Berlin Philharmonic serves as plumb-line. It ranges from excellent (1, 5 and 9) to competent (3) to boring (4 & 7) and finally, to Calamity Jane (2, 6 & 8). Indeed, that Sixth is almost the worst performance in discography of a Bruckner symphony by a big name orchestra. Its loathsome.

Here in Take Three, theres nothing to detain a seasoned lover of Bruckner. High competency is regnant to the exclusion of transcendence and spontaneous combustion. Not once does one stand in the middle of the Great Forest. Constellations and Black Holes are equally in short supply. As one listens to Bruckner for that metaphysical angel-dust  however it is interpreted  its absence is afflictive. That being said, improvements are evident. The Second, Sixth and Eighth Symphonies benefit from more rehearsal time even if theres nothing distinctive or inflammatory in way of vision. One motors along with them - thats about it. Others have commented that DB has fallen out of love with the B1. I agree. Compared with the Berlin outing (which was stellar in every way) this is a crude, perfunctory affair. Deterioration marks this Fifth and Ninth from their predecessors in Berlin: DB has nothing new to say and hes saying it with a lesser orchestra; moreover  and this is a disgrace - hes sped up even further in the Adagio of the Fifth. DB remains the Plainest of Plain Janes in the Fourth  its the most mundane performance here by a wide margin. He has no feel for its mystery or terror. Competent though they be, the new Third and Seventh are concert-grade and not much more in ordnance.

All too often, the violins of the Staatskapelle Berlin are swamped by the brass and bass-line whereas in Berlin, they're always there. Just listen to how they flounder in the opening climax of the finale of this Fourth  the French put up more of a fight in 1940. Their Klang is generic too. On the whole, the recordings are acceptable.

All of this can mean only one thing: sausages ahoy! No queue jumping please! Form a line and hot steamy sausages  nine in number  will grace your plate! Theyll do the job and not much more. More widely, this performance of the Fourth is a contender in my Quest for DBs Holy Sausage. Feature it will in later calculations.",1477440000,3

Sounds crazy, right? Who even knew Candlebox was still making new music? Not me, but I am glad they are.

Disappearing in Airports is a fantastic record from start to finish. Kevin Martin sounds amazing and his lyrics are the best I've heard from anyone in years. My favorite tracks are; Only Because of You, Vexations, Supernova, Alive at Last, I've Got a Gun, I Want it Back.

Not a bad tune on here.

If you liked their debut record, you will enjoy this one, as well.

Also, I only found out about this album thanks to Amazon Prime. I couldn't stop listening to it. As soon as I had the cash, i ordered a copy to blast in my van. So, thank you Amazon Prime!

I'm an idiot. Then, when I saw that he's playing at my local bar in a month or so, I clicked play on ""Pearls to Swine,"" and that haunting falsetto, the rich acoustic tone, his violin player... drew me in harder than any album has this year. Add in the hilarity of his percussionist being Thor Harris of Swans (WHAT?), the humility that would come from living an unassuming and relatively ""normal"" life for 10 years, and the fact that Adam Torres cut his teeth while going to school in my favorite place on earth, Southeast Ohio... I love this guy.

The first song is where the falsetto is at its highest, so if that causes you some issues (as it clearly doesn't for me), stick with it and he tones it down a bit. Mountain River is apparently a retread from his eponymous EP from several years earlier, but it is the clearest and best folk song I've heard all year.",1477526400,5

94271,2664,19195,"Athens, Georgias masters of Americana storytelling and elevated Southern country rock songwriting return with their 13th studio album. Their twin guitars rock with an electric rural purity that turns on the lights in farmhouses everywhere. The amazingly insightful and literate lyrics from Patterson Hood & Mike Cooley put you right it the moment, invest you in the song.  These are stories of life as it happens.  Participants aren't judged, but there are plenty of comments on the political powers that turn the wheels. Musically, the band plays classic Southern guitar rock to stir the heart and soul, and they do it with an impressive mix of passion & professionalism. Reminiscent of artists like Hold Steady, Centro-Matic, Neil Young, Water Liars, Allman Brothers Band.  Every time Drive-By Truckers release a new album, you know something good and worth listening to is coming.  American Band continues that trend.  Recommended.",1477526400,5

94290,56,18457,"There are just very few artists that are out there right now, that have had massive success from the 80's that those songs still stand strong today. We have lost a lot of those artists from drugs, alcohol, and self-doubt on whether they can be who they are today, as they did back then. This past year, we lost Prince, Pete Burns of Dead Or Alive and David Bowie to just name a few. But of all of the acts that have passed away, there has been some that really have came back strong personally and professionally. Phil Collins has made the ambitious decision about coming out of retirement, and coming back musically, and personally, and the decision has been both brilliant and personal. He re-released his entire catalog and his work has definitely sounded better than ever. But back in 1985, he was someone that took on a lot of heat when he sampled Prince's 1999  with his massive hit, Sussudio. But the song today sounds just as strong and vibrant, as it did back then. The song still makes me want to just get up, sing and dance. It is one of those fee-good anthems that really is worth the soul. If you have just re-discovered Phil's music, or are just a hard core Phil Collins fan, than you should download the song.

94321,12631,9285,"According to Billboard they were among the top recording acts of the 1980's. Over a period spanning 16 years beginning in 1974 they recorded for three different labels, placed nearly three dozen singles on the Top 100 Singles chart and had several highly successful albums to boot. Yes, the music of Daryl Hall and John Oates seemed to be everywhere during this period.

Hall and Oates began their recording career at Atlantic records in the early 1970's. In 1974, they had a minor hit with a tune called ""She's Gone"". Although this record was not wildly successful it was clear that these guys were going to be a force to be reckoned with in the coming years. RCA records took note and signed Hall & Oates in 1975. Their very first release for the label ""Sara Smile"" was on the charts for some 7 months and peaked at #3 in the spring of 1976. Atlantic records took note and re-released ""She's Gone"" which also became a Top Ten hit in '76.  In January 1977 RCA released the boys' third single.  ""Rich Girl"" would become the first of six #1 singles for Hall & Oates spending two weeks at the top of the charts In March of that year.

94346,6760,19450,"Helen Jane Long's music is an uncommon combination of intensity and relaxation. I think of it as a pot of boiling water with the lid on it. Truly amazing stuff. This album may be her best yet, and given her youth and skill, I look forward to many more to come.

The aesthetic that HJL achieves is something that I didn't know I needed in my music collection until I heard it. I am a huge fan of the post-rock genre (Explosions in the Sky, Caspian, A Winged Victory for the Sullen, Hammock, etc.), but many of these are bombastic and huge in their sound, or they have a relaxed sound that lacks much in the way of forward intensity. HJL's music, on the other hand, is what my students call ""chill,"" but not at the expense of intensity and a destination. Too often I find that solo piano work is meandering or simply more like an audio landscape, so I was thrilled to find that HJL writes piano music that is not just a wandering walk through a garden -- it's a journey, with a true beginning, middle, and end.

As for this album: it is a champion, from start to finish. The title track leaves me close to tears every time I listen to it. It's the soul of minimalist expressiveness, saying so much with so few notes that I find myself aching for the next chord or single note. Her touch on the keys is truly expert, and her flexible timing of notes (is rubato the word I'm seeking here?) is like the most tasteful jazz. In fact, I would be surprised if HJL isn't also an accomplished jazz musician, because so much of her sensibility seems to be aligned with jazz. Miles Davis -- that's the name that comes to mind, but of course in a different genre altogether. HJL brings a Davis-esque flexibility and expressiveness of rhythm to her music that really transports the listener. Of course, you have to be in a state of readiness for this type of music to enjoy it, but much like Kind of Blue, I find that Identity changes for me every time I listen to it.

In short, if you like to read late at night, or meditate before sleep, or just sit outside and lose yourself in thought -- or stare into the blaze of a fireplace  and try to capture that without-mind moment that's so elusive -- but you like to do these things with music in your ears, this is the album for you. This is the artist for you.

Bravo, Helen Jane Long. Bravo.",1477612800,5

94397,6064,19454,"This disc by chance pairs the soundtracks from one of the early 70's most popular and successful films with one of the same period's least known and successful. This was due to the popularity of Michel Legrand. He was a moderately-known jazz pianist until his unique score for The Umbrellas of Cherbourg (1963) became widely known. The film was sung all the way through in French yet was a surprising success in America largely due to the charm of its music and its star, Catherine Deneuve.  From this point on Legrand  became well known and was in demand as a film composer (he had been scoring French films since the mid 50's).

The film scores are in reverse chronological order on the discs and I will follow that order here. Summer of '42 was the sixth-biggest film of 1971 taking in 32 million dollars on a one million dollar budget. It was one of those films that everyone knew and talked about  and which seemed to be in theaters forever (released in April it was still playing late in the year). It haunting theme was a very French melody tinged with melancholy and nostalgia, perhaps the best theme of its type since Yves Montand introduced Autumn Leaves. It became the biggest hit in his career for Peter Nero in December of '71 and as was the custom, words were written for it as The Summer Knows. It remains one of the most famous movie themes ever.

What we have here is a reproduction of the soundtrack album. The way things were done until well into the CD era was that soundtrack albums never contained the actual soundtrack. That would have been too long and broken up into odd bits and pieces as the film required. The composers created pop-length tracks or suites from the music they composed for a film and recorded the albums a few weeks after the actual score, usually with a smaller orchestra. Though I watch this film occasionally, it's been too long a time for me to say if there was much more to the actual score than the seventeen minutes we have here. The album seems to indicate that the score was really a single theme woven in and out  to maintain a mood and that this was not a fully scored film with many themes. Both approaches have been used over the years by various composers. So what you get here for the Summer of '42 is a set of variations on a theme scored a bit differently but not very dissimilar. it's just enough to recall the film or simply relax and enjoy the spell cast by this evocative music before it would wear out its welcome.

Even the vinyl LP in 1971 was filled in with the Suite from The Picasso Summer, indicating that either there wasn't much more music from The Summer of '42 or that it would indeed wear out its welcome if extended to both sides. The Picasso Summer had everything going for it: a major studio (Warner Brothers), director (Serge Bourguignon-later replaced), stars (the charismatic Albert Finney and the lovely Yvette Mimieux), cinematographer (Vilmos Zsigismond), writer (Ray Bradbury), and composer (Michel Legrand).. However it was the late 60's and this was an experimental film that tried to use a 30 minute live action story to frame nearly an hour of animations of famous Picasso paintings (mixed with a few photographs and psychedelic effects that were popular back then). The result was such a total mess that the producers had their names taken off of it and it was never released in the U.S. It later appeared on television occasionally, at first on CBS and later on Bravo. I've seen all the animation and a number of live action clips but I've never seen it all put together.

The score really runs the gamut of styles for Legrand and even includes some music from Sopwith Camel, who appera at the ""Pop Art Party"" toward the beginning of the film. The music for the animated Picasso sequences is chaotic and almost formless and reminds me of some mid-century classical music or perhaps the avant guarde jazz of Ornette Coleman. It works well enough with the animated paintings and I'm sure it was an interesting challenge for Legrand to compose it, but I find it a bit too unwelcoming when only listening to it. The live action sections contain  Spanish music for the scenes shot there and one of Legrand's greatest romantic themes to accompany the beautiful scenery of the South of France. Like many of Legarnd's themes its deceptively simple yet able to convey powerful feelings and imagery. It would have been a terrible loss for this music to be as lost because of the film's failure.

I agree with those who say that a Cd of the original LP would have been enough, since the Suite from The Picasso Summer has all of the important music. But now it's most easily available as this 2-CD set and I'd rather have too much music than not have it at all. Besides, this is one of those deluxe remasterings from Intrada, one of the top film score labels, and they went back to Warner's original masters for this set and have engineered it perfectly and given it a thorough booklet. Like other top film score labels, these are limited releases and there are ususlly only a few thousand. When they're gone, expect this set to be extremely high priced. So if you are interested, get it now.",1477699200,5

94419,1805,17114,"The second half of Tremontis recent solo outing (Cauterize was the first) lays it down fast, heavy, and hard but is a better release than Cauterize because the songs separate and distinguish themselves a lot better across this release than on the previous one. They have more of their own individual voices, and more dynamics probably because he shifts tempos more than on that last release. So in a lot of respects this is more similar to All I Was than to Cauterize, but it flows better than both of those and you can hear Tremontis maturity and growth on this release. This will blister your ears on the initial listens and then cause you to reflect on future spins. Im listening to Catching Fire as I write this and am hearing some of the subtle background atmosphere and sonics that enhance this and many of the other tracks on Dust. And Im digging it. Marks singing is a lot smoother and there are more back-up notes from the other voices that just create a fuller feeling, a deeper emotion, and more energy. Even though were not quite through with 2016 I think that its safe for me to say that this is my favorite metal release for this year.",1477699200,5

94428,3202,19367,"""Lover, Beloved"" is pleasant, but slight. It's not the best work Vega has done. In fact, it's the weakest entry 30 years. I don't know much about Carson McCullers, never read any of her books or poetry. This whole album, a concept album, deals with her life. So, lyrically, the songs are just okay, and musically, well, there's nothing here to really grab you.

My favorite tracks are ""We of Me"" and ""Harper Lee"". The rest are fine, but the whole album just feels like background music to listen to while sipping your favorite cup of hot tea.

I prefer Vega when she's more experimental musically, and more poetic lyrically. This just wasn't it.

Here's how ""Lover, Beloved"" compares to Vega's other works:

Suzanne Vega (1985): Two and a Half Stars
Solitude Standing (1987): Three Stars
Days of Open Hand (1990): Three and a Half Stars
99.9F (1992): Four Stars
Nine Objects of Desire (1996): Four Stars
Songs in Red and Grey (2001): Four Stars
Beauty & Crime (2007): Four Stars
Tales from the Realm of the Queen of Pentacles (2014): Four Stars

94480,16685,19462,"This is a successful performance of Edvard Griegs two Peer Gynt Suites and Jan Sibelius music for the play Pelleas and Melisand from Herbert von Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic.  Typical of Karajans work with his long-time orchestra, technically excellent, precise musicmaking is combined with musicality and emotional range.  The issue is an appalling sound engineering job from Deutsche Grammophon, a label which has long received criticism from audiophiles over its erratic and often poor standards.  The disc sounds muddy and obscure, with soft music disappearing beneath a weird digital haze.  It baffles me that the worlds most famous conductor and orchestra would be subjected to this sort of studio incompetence.

The actual performance is a good one.  The Hall of the Mountain King receives a rousing performance and I thought the final number in the suites, Solveigs Song, is particularly nicely done.  The two Peer Gynt Suites, some of the worlds most famous music, are paired with the incidental music from Jan Sibelius, who wrote it in 1905 for a famous symbolist play from Maurice Maeterlinck.  While the play has inspired many composers, including an incredible opera from Claude Debussy, I think his incidental music definitely ranks in the lower tier of Sibelius output.  The one highlight for me is the third number, At the Seashore, a lovely and brooding few minutes of nature painting.  Karajan is a master conductor of Sibelius and this performance is up to his standards.  But again the issue is the sound.  For a composer so focused on instrumental effects, the muddy, blurred sound truly damages the output.

I am downgrading this release to 3 stars because of the engineering issues, which is a shame because it would be successful release based on the mostly attractive music and the fine performance.  Sometimes one part of the whole is so defective that it drags down the rest.",1477785600,3

They are jarring at first but the rapid benefits are well worth it. I use them in by themselves for hours at a time and also in conjunction with the Kasina Mind Machine and its light strobe feature which matches the tones with strobing light, this has a great deal of benefit.",1477785600,5

Can't wait to start driving soon, I'll he cranking this up loud at all times, haters will hate B). So, yeah, amazing album, but don't forget the first 2 albums in all that you do, or IV.

94555,12631,4728,"Ocie Lee Smith (better known as O.C.) was an R&B singer born in Mansfield, Louisiana and raised in Los Angeles. From a very early age Ocie expressed a keen interest in becoming a singer. His first love was jazz but he also dug the blues. He was greatly influenced by people like Nat King Cole, B.B. King, John Lee Hooker, Tony Bennett, Billy Eckstine and Ray Charles. Ocie sang with a number of big bands including a two and a half year stint with the Count Basie Orchestra in the early 1960's. Then in 1966 he signed a recording contract with Columbia records. His first single in early 1966 was a mellow, slowly swaying and highly memorable song called ""Thats Life"" (by Kelly Gordon  Dean Kay Thompson). ""Thats Life"" made some noise but didn't sell enough copies to hit the national charts (later, in early 67, it bubbled under at # 127). While riding in his car Frank Sinatra, however, heard the song on the radio, arranged a meeting with O.C. and asked for O.C.s blessing to cover the song.  O.C. was flattered, and almost a year later, in late 66, Frank took the song into Billboard Hot 100, where it climbed all the way to #4.

Then in the autumn of 1968 O.C.s cover of Bobby Russells gentle and innocent ballad ""Little Green Apples"" hit the market and became O.C.s biggest hit. It went as high as # 2 on both the pop and R&B charts and became a certified gold record. The record also garnered two Grammy awards as Pop Song of the Year and Country Song of the Year for 1968.  This is the original Columbia hit recording you would remember from the radio.",1477872000,5

94591,9073,18339,"Chelsea Grin have yet undergone another change since their previous album. With the departure of guitarist Jason Richardson and the transition to Rise Records, who knew what they would have up their sleeve next? Well, unfortunately, they've lost whatever great thing they had going on previously and they've now become a band that's confused and scraping the bottom of the barrel for ideas.

I once read that the band claimed this album to be their most extreme. Well, I'm not buying it, because even among all of the chugging and growling, it feels flat throughout. Alex Koehler's performance feels like it's phoned in, lacking any dynamics he used to possess, and the songs themselves are inconsistent in quality. There are some decent bangers, like the djent-esque ""Broken Bonds"" or the blunt delivery provided by ""Clickbait"" (turn your brain off for this one, it gets pretty dumb), but they don't feel anything like the band they once were. Instead, I feel like I'm listening to a carbon copy Rise records djent-metalcore band that opts for death growling throughout instead of the traditional unclean/clean tradeoff expected for many bands on the label. Don't even get me started on the song ""Never, Forever"", which is the worst attempt at making a dynamic metalcore song ever; imagine Bullet For My Valentine with lame death vox, complete with a backing keyboard.

If Chelsea Grin keep going after this, hopefully they can build up from here and not sound like another faceless manufactured Rise band. So far, without either Michael Stafford or Jason Richardson, it's not looking well...",1477958400,2

94689,9291,8445,"ANTHEM FOR BABY-BOOMERS.  While many folks fit the title of this song when they reach the ripe young age of twenty, it is generally the case that most adults fit the title of the song by the time they reach the age of sixty or so.  The words are simple as is the tune.  Also, note that the lyrics as well as the tune are infectious.  Snake Oil Willie Band has created a video that accompanies the song.  I have watched this video on over thirty occasions, since I first discovered it in the summer of 2016.  The video is attractive and clever for several reasons.

First, the video includes intentional noise in the image, taking the form of very brief moments of ""television snow"" and various forms of visual sonic static.  It should also pointed out that intentional defects in art are considered, in some cases, to enhance the aesthetic qualities of the work.  One example are the unintentional squeaks and off-notes that are created when period instruments are used to record music from the Baroque era.  Another example, is Marilyn Monroe's mole (is it not the case that this little mole makes Ms. Monroe more appealing and memorable?).  Yet another example, is a graphic art style known as ""diesel punk.""  One example of diesel punk are the distressed, rusted, and deteriorated qualities of some of the vehicles in some of the Star Wars movies, in particular, in The Force Awakens.  And so, the intentional static in the video by Snake Oil Willie enhances our enjoyment.

Second, the babacious cowgirls are eye candy.

Third, the inclusion of ordinary people (plump couples) who join in with the singing adds an appealing home-grown touch to the video.

Fourth, the humble attitude taken by the singer, Tony Krucinski, is appealing.  The poor man gently complains that he can't chop wood any more with an axe.  Also, he complains that his tummy sticks out so much that he can't see his own feet any more.  Moreover, he complains that his wife ""don't wanna!""

OTHER NOVELTY SONGS.  My review is called, ""One of the most appealing novelty songs ever recorded.""  To provide a context for this remark, I am providing a list of other novelty songs.  Other novelty songs include, Ahab the Arab, They're Coming to Take Me Away, Monster Mash, Little Egypt, Witch Doctor, and Martian Hop.  And let us not overlook, I Hate To Wake Up Sober in Nebraska, by Free Hot Lunch Band.",1478044800,5

So why is this so darn boring?  I like covers and duets so let's have fun!  However fun is what is missing. There just doesn't seem to be any chemistry or enthusiasm or joy. They both are competent. They chose great songs. Then they proceed to go through the motions. There is something missing here. Want a great duet?  Check out Steve with Sheryl Crowe on Side Tracks or Shawn with Richard Thompson. Or get last year's Van Morrison or Jerry Lee Lewis albums!!!!

They just don't find a spark together.",1478044800,3

94739,15809,14476,"This is definitely the band's worst album, but its still a good one. Their typical electric guitars are a little more prominent on this effort, but keyboards and synths are still the driving forces behind most of these songs. Although the bubblegum production of the record doesnt help the group, it's the instrumentation and lyrical contributions from outside songwriters that are watering down their signature sound. In fact, the meaningless and sometimes profane lyrics on a few of the tracks come across as creepy, vulgar and a little arrogant. While Maroon 5 is still my favorite popular band, they need to take a step back and make more music like their earlier works before they stray too far away from who they are and lose a fan in me. My favorites are ""Maps"" ""It Was Always You"", ""Sugar"" and ""Coming Back For You"".",1478131200,4

94777,56,17439,"The past several years have been more about Beyonce' than any of the other divas. But also, it has been more about her overexposure in the music industry. But also it has been more about things internally that also have hurt her in her personal life. One of them is that her husband Jay-Z cheating on her, and having a child out of wedlock. That same feeling also was said about her father Matthew Knowles that had cheated on her mom Tina, and caused that marriage to end in a abrupt and un-amicable divorce. Honestly, when I had heard Beyonce' Knowles make her album Lemonade, I honestly would have to say not on;y was I unimpressed with her album, but I again felt she really had been lagging in musicality in the way she used to have it when she was a part of Destiny's Child. When I heard her song, Daddy Lessons, I thought it was very interesting to hear her try her hands into a country song with her over-branding in R&B. Well, it has worked for divas like The Pointer Sisters that were the first girl group to perform at The Grand Old Opry. At least it is one of her better songs that she had done in years, but not as good as songs like Listen or Halo were. Still, it is a interesting twist in her career, but not really one that has more of a definitive appeal. Hopefully, she will learn to have better in her voice than what she has had before. Honestly, Hymn For The Weekend with Coldplay is her best song this year, and not from her record Lemonade.

After CLOWNS they do play a cover of RIDE LIKE THE WIND...both of which are fortunately NOT edited. Other than that, throw this record away and make your own green rosetta.

94785,9574,14499,"One of Viennas first music publishers, Franz Hoffmeister (1754-1812) was close friends with most of the composers of the high Classical Era. In a letter, Beethoven referred to him as my most beloved brother, and Mozart dedicated his String Quartet in D Major, KV 499 to him. He also wrote a little music, with at least 8 operas, as many as 66 symphonies, about 57 string quartets and numerous other chamber works to his credit. Much of that chamber music includes a flute, as does at least 25 concertos.

Published in 1795, his first D Major Concerto on the present recording is No. 24 on that list. With an orchestral introduction that is nearly 3 minutes in length, the martial Allegro that begins the composition is an ambitiously expansive movement. Driven by horns and booming tympani, it effectively sets up the feathery entrance of the solo flute. Instead of creating an interactive relationship, Hoffmeister uses the symphonic backing to fill in behind the single wind instrument, deftly weaving the orchestral passages around the melodic lines, following the breath patterns and not overwhelming the delicate sound of the flute. And it is a virtuosic display. Demanding a high level of technique, this first movement is challenge that the flutist, Bruno Meier easily rises to meet.

Employing a gentle Alla plocca ma lento as the leisurely middle section allows the flute ample opportunity to stretch out and embellish the charming, aria-like tune. As the horns waft overhead, the music shifts into G Minor, adding drama by the use of chromatic modulations and striking harmonies before easing back to the major key for the placid ending. A bubbly flute introduces the festive theme for the closing Rondo Moderato. Rapid runs and extreme changes of register mark the bravura solo work while tempo shifts, brief episodes in minor, playful syncopated flourishes and a surprising time signature change into triple meter enliven the boisterous finale.

Another spacious Allegro opens the 21st concerto, published in 1788 and also penned in D Major. Buttressed by the horns, the orchestral intro for the first movement is nearly as extensive as the other opening allegro. Elegant and immediately engaging, the solo wind carries the tuneful excursions through wide ranging development again without much interaction with the symphonic support.

In the dark key in D Minor, the dramatic Romanza Adagio bristles with ominous undertones as the flute fashions a remarkable contrast with the accompaniment for strings only. Despite an interlude in the relatively brighter F Major, the heavy aura of the 2nd movement never lifts. But the brash finale, a triple metered Rondo Allegro completely dissipates the gloom. Brilliant virtuosity in the flute lines characterize this sparkling close to the concerto.

The 2011 recording by Naxos is terrific, well balanced with depth and excellent detail. Bruno Meiers work on solo flute is exemplary, and the Prague Chamber Orchestra provides sturdy and sensitive support. Although these 2 fine compositions were issued during Hoffmeisters lifetime, this disc marks their world premiere. One of the most popular composers during the Viennese Classical period, he fell into obscurity upon his death. While his work will never rival Beethovens, it does present a glimpse into this excellent craftsmen who became an also ran in the shadow of the master from Bonn.",1478131200,4

94790,2982,19488,"Shane Atkinson is the man behind this album that is the work of 8 years. He composes, writes and
plays many instruments, but he has received some help from others musicians. The beginning of the cd
is very strong with some intense vocal harmonies and some music that is on the melodic side of
Progressive Rock with sometimes a heavy edge reminiscent of old Americain Prog with some spark of
the British's sound of the Neo Prog bands. All this music is embellished with some lush
orchestrations and choirs. The multi-part compositions go from the atmospheric to the dramatic with
dazzling vintage organ and mellotron. The influences from the past are there and cover a lot of
ground. The vocals and the music in the song ""Evermore"" are in the pure Queen style. The epic ""Flying
Machine is not without reference to the band Mystery with a mix of classic rock and Progressive
Rock. The song goes back and forth between acoustic parts and electric ones. There is a nice flow
throughout the different parts of this cd. The songs contain many hooks, and also some moving
progressive rock moments that keep you engage. It's just the right balance between the simplicity of
rock music and a more complex Progressive Rock. I had the same uplifting feeling listening to this
cd of the one I had when Sean Filkins (ex-Big Big Train) released his solo cd. The man has a lot more
material for others albums. I just hope that we don't have to wait another 8 years to hear it. So
let's take the journey to the world of Evership, you will love the ride!",1478131200,4

Their rival merely steps across the street serves up 5 star dishes to the elite. The young Indian son has a passion for cooking and sets out to make a name for himself only to come back and help put the snooty restaurant back on top. It's about a passion for cooking, family dynamics and a love story and certainly a wonderful feel good movie.",1478217600,5

94839,12631,13566,"Ocie Lee Smith (better known as O.C.) was an R&B singer born in Mansfield, Louisiana and raised in Los Angeles. From a very early age Ocie expressed a keen interest in becoming a singer. His first love was jazz but he also dug the blues. He was greatly influenced by people like Nat King Cole, B.B. King, John Lee Hooker, Tony Bennett, Billy Eckstine and Ray Charles. Ocie sang with a number of big bands including a two and a half year stint with the Count Basie Orchestra in the early 1960's. Then in 1966 he signed a recording contract with Columbia records. His first single in early 1966 was a mellow, slowly swaying and highly memorable song called ""Thats Life"" (written by Kelly Gordon  Dean Kay Thompson). ""Thats Life"" made some noise but didn't sell enough copies to hit the national charts. However, while riding in his car Frank Sinatra happened to hear the song on the radio and arranged for a meeting with O.C. Frank asked for O.C.s blessing to cover the song. O.C. was flattered and almost a year later, in the waning weeks of 1966 Frank took the song into Billboard Hot 100, where it climbed all the way to #4. And now you know the rest of the story.......",1478217600,5

94881,16730,123,Bad. Even after getting this 'remastered' version the audio quality still lacks compared to many other albums and songs brought back remastered to sound great in MP3 format.  I can't even remix this myself because of the poor bitrate.  This is a ripoff and you're better off using a youtube script or something to get this.  I wish I could get a refund seeing as the other songs priced at 30cents more that usual are things from Nine Inch Nails that I would rather have because they actually sound GOOD in a modern system.,1478217600,1

94899,1611,5910,"With their record contracts with Pye and Reprise being expired in 1971, The Kinks
  felt free to pursue a new recording contract that led them to secure a record deal with
  RCA Records which resulted with the release of this highly accomplished album later
  that year. Officially billed as a definition to the bands crossover albums from the late-
  1960s, Muswell Hillbillies successfully repeated the influences of Music Hall with the
  traditional American stylings of country music and bluegrass well thrown in to careful
  well-structured effect as it focuses the alienation of the working man and takes place
  at Muswell Hill, a London suburb where Ray and Dave Davies were brought up while
  it contain songs which focuses on working class life and again, on Davies childhood.
  With the superlative music brilliantly composed by Ray and performed by the band to
  utmost empathy, the track set starts off with the supercharged hit single 20th Century
  Man as it concludes merrily with heart and sensibility on other songs, including Acute
  Schizophrenia, Paranoia Blues, Holiday, Skin And Bone, Here Come The People In
  Grey, Have A Cuppa Tea and Muswell Hillbilly (Alcoholic and Skin And Bone are the
  most atypical classics in The Kinks catalogue).  As one of the bands finest and most
  beloved masterworks, Muswell Hillbillies was greeted with critical acclaim but started
  out as a fair accomplishment on the charts upon its official release, then its success
  soon caught on.  And what made the album as appealing is the album cover that was
  taken at The Archway Tavern as it shows the band below a signpost giving directions
  to Muswell Hill which add to the albums truly unforgettable epitomized successone
  that will remain a captivatingly outright and astonishing work of art. Plus you will hear
  the albums radio commercial which just wraps up the remastered finishing touch.",1478217600,5

I daresay he alone will usher in a new day for bluegrass; he embodies the past, present and definitely future of this genre and will likely be the artist to introduce a whole new generation to bluegrass as a cross-over. His stellar talent combines bluegrass, a little metal and good old rock-and-roll for a fresh, updated take. But not worry, for the traditionalists, he stays true and respectful to the ""old timey"" sound, but those looking for a little more, he definitely takes everything up a huge notch. If you like what you hear on the CD, you owe to yourself to see him play live - you'll leave the event knowing you just witnessed something truly extraordinary!!",1478304000,5

This whole CD is one of my favorites.  I play it and sing it in the car, on my Bose, hum it, sing it out wherever I am... it says everything that's in my heart and soul.  It's as if they read my heart and soul and put it to beautiful words and music and I can't thank them enough.

95029,7472,19512,"Regardless of how you feel about the movie ""Capircorn One"" (and I enjoy the movie even with its flaws), Jerry Goldsmith's score was a flawless, suspenseful piece thst can pretty much stand on its own.

As with most soundtrack albums of the time (and this is the original recording remastered and reissued), some of the score has been combined and varies a bit compared to the original score.

 This is a nice reissue with excellent booklet notes. I do wish we would get the original soundtrack stems from the film at some point but this will do in a pinch.",1478390400,5

95073,56,17923,"Honestly, I have not really been intrigued by girl groups for the past decade, because they have not had the strike in the hotness of the iron, while the songs were hot from the soul. Unfortunately, Fifth Harmony has been more like the tween group that hasn't shown that they could blossom louder than words. I had found that so far the songs that the gals have made for their 7/27 album, have been below par to the soul that they could have set afire. Their only song that showed that they were maturing with the essence of the soul was Write On Me. Their other tracks like Work From Home ans All In My Head (Flex) were not very solid. That's My Girl, their latest single, again falls short of being a more empowering anthem. It doesn't work in the same way that someone like Beyonce' had with Run The World (Girls.) It just doesn't have the staying power that groups used to have like En Vogue or TLC. I think that Fifth Harmony needs to really find their deeper, inner voice that can set the world more aflame than what it currently is, just a small candle wick.

95101,56,1065,"Honestly, there are few and far between songs that have been more than worthwhile from the 2000 decade. There have been more songs about the artists' images, rather than the sincerity from the heart. But it is very rare that a song from television that has stood the test of time even after the fame. That has been the case when The Fray came out in the 2000 decade. They were alright in regards to their music with a few songs. But however, when their songs made it big for shows like Grey's Anatomy. That has shown with one of my favorite guilty pleasure songs from that decade, How To Save A Life. The song really is The Fray's biggest hit at the soul and song at heart. It is one of those songs that really is worth what the money is from the group. They have honestly had other songs that were worth that dollar as well like You Found Me a few years later. But if you really would like to hear one song from The Fray, well this would be the song that you should go to first. I recommend you download this track.

One thing though, K-Rino's recent albums are getting better overall. They are better produced, sounds better and has better beats. But as far as going out of his way to experiment, he is not. He is still doing what he does, not that its a bad thing since he does it well. I like his music, because you always know what you're getting. Its always going to be dope but don't expect any surprises. I would like to be surprised sometime by him though, he has a lot of range.

This great band from northern Louisiana reminds me much of the sounds of Lynyrd Skynrd and other southern rock bands. I loved this album from start to finish. This 8 track album starts of with my favorite song Southern Way and includes such great tracks as Redneck Revival, Whiskey, Red Worm and so much more and then finishes off with the ballad It Goes On.

I love the calmness in most songs, and the music on this album strikes me as so seamless that I almost can't see them playing it while I listen. It seems like they are robots or aliens rather than humans. Great stuff and I was looking forward to it for a long time and definitely not disappointed.

VINYL: Quality is decent... There are three tracks that really bug me with some distortion at certain parts, other than that my copy sounds good. I really do wish though that the whole record was just perfect because for example, halfway through Daydreaming when the bass comes in it just distorts and crackles on every note. Not a problem with my system or speakers as I play records every day and have no problems. So that really takes away from the song... Anyways, an okay pressing.",1478563200,5

95239,11478,19450,"A Reflective Review By Andrea R. Garrison  Online With Andrea

Every time I listen to the music of Helen Jane Long I am impressed and deeply touched by the depth and the tenderness that she projects in her music.  She is a magnificent composer and a sensitive pianist that strikes every single chord perfectly. If you really want to explore her music don't think just listen to every single delicate note that she plays.  As I listen to the music of Helen Jane Long I am moved beyond words by the emotions that she shares and expresses in her music.  What more can I say about a sound that is simply beautiful to hear. Her playing and her composition are truly stunning. The Identity release is another great release by this wonderful Composer/Pianist from the UK. I highly recommend Identity as well as any other previous releases by Helen Jane Long. For more information on Helen Jane Long visit her website and listen to the Online With Andrea interview with Helen Jane Long.

This is a very political album, like other reviewers have said, they really have always written about political issues. These songs though tell great stories, they get you thinking. To me politics has always made great music, from Guthrie and Dylan, to James McMurtry, Steve Earle, and the Drive-By Truckers. It really is a good rock and roll album from one of the great bands of the day. Surrender Under Protest always gets stuck in my head, catchy tune.

""Two times and I take a round. Will you forgive me?"" - Bad Habits refrain

Five DETERMINED Stars. ""Bad Habits"" (Uncut) is an excellent track by the acclaimed Grammy-winning soul/R&B composer and singer, Maxwell, from his 2009 album: the Grammy-winning, platinum-selling ""BLACKsummers'night"". The album debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200 chart and is part of a planned trilogy which was followed by the 2016 album ""blackSUMMERsnight"". The musical group includes Frederico Pena on keyboards, Shedrick Mitchel on organ, Keyon Harrold on trumpet, Kenneth Whalum III on saxophones, and Saunders Sermons II on trombone. Maxwell executes his sensual, but cryptic PG lyrics as he describes an intense meeting with a lover that builds when trumpeter Harrold, saxophonist Whalum, and trombonist Sermons join forces in the background. There is some Marvin Gaye influence in subject matter, horn use, and mood, but with Maxwell's originality. Produced by MUSZE (Maxwell) and Hod David. Highly Recommended with sensual cautions. Five SEXY Stars. (Columbia records. 1-MP3 track. X-Ray lyrics. Time-5:51.)",1478649600,5

Wild Belle consists of the brother/sister duo Elliot and Natalie Bergman. Elliot plays keyboards and saxophone, and Natalie sings and plays rhythm guitar. They issued a terrific debut album in 2013 called ""Isles"", an all-out reggae/ska affair that was just incredibly fun to listen (and dance) to. I had it in the top 10 of my list of best albums of that year. After incessant touring and a well-deserved break, the band finally returns 3 years later with their sophomore album.

""Dreamland"" (11 tracks; 39 min.) opens with a blazing and irresistible ""Mississippi River"", possibly the very best track on here. ""Losing You"" is brought in a world music setting, rather than just reggae/ska/soul. Natalie's vocals shine on the title track. ""Cannonball"" is another highlight, awash in a heavy groove. ""Giving Up On You"" (1st radio single) is a nervous-sounding, hard-charging tune. ""It Was You (Baby Come Back To Me)"" is a ballad, but Wild Belle-style. ""The One That Got Away"" has an African sub-beat to it. The album closes with the hopeful ""Our Love Will Survive"", set on reggae-lite grooves. At almost 40 min., this album clips by in no time. The band's musical direction has evolved quite a bit since ""Isles"", and its musical pallet is far broader now.

I had the good fortune of seeing Wild Belle in concert just earlier this week (on election night, in fact) here in Cincinnati. They headlined a gig at the beautiful Woodward Theatre, and live they are a five-some. Their set was pretty much an even mix between songs from the first two albums, but I must tell you that the songs they played from ""Dreamland"" (including Cannonball, Coyotes, Losing You, and Mississippi River) all sounded much heavier and groovier than what you hear on the album. The set was basically one long dance party. Fantastic evening of music. If you have a chance to see them live, do not miss them!",1478736000,4

95440,291,16881,"""The future ain't what it used to be""
 - from ""Tennessee Song""

Very frank, personal and committed songwriting (Margo Price co-wrote nine of the ten tracks here) and vocal interpretation, reminiscent of prime Loretta Lynn (the album's title is a tip of the cap to the coal miner's daughter) and Dolly Parton, with modern sensibilities and diverse musical arrangements.  And there is also a doff of the chapeau (""Hurtin' [On the Bottle]"") given to the late, great Merle Haggard, as this is uncompromising, somewhat out-of-the-mainstream stuff, unafraid to be on the outside and occasionally go ""outlaw.""  It's all incredibly entertaining.

""Four Years of Chances"" is one of the coolest songs of the year - an intensity-building, rhythmic country-soul rocker that would seem to be in a future-classic league with Etta James' ""Seven Day Fool.""

The opener ""Hands of Time"" plumbs the depths of disillusionment while still holding out great hope for the future within the confines of the same beautifully arranged country ballad.  ""About to Find Out"" reminds one of Loretta at her feistiest and most determined (think ""Fist City,"" among others).

""This Town Gets Around"" goes after Nashville's sexism and sleazy ethics; and in the pedal-steel-drenched honky-tonker ""Since You Put Me Down,"" the singer admits to being ""an outcast and a stray.""  ""Weekender"" has her ""backslidin' again"" and landing in the county jail.

The one Margo Price did not co-author, ""How the Mighty Have Fallen,"" is a tuneful and touching ballad with a huge hook that one could imagine Roy Orbison having sung.

Easily one of the finest efforts of the year.",1478822400,5

95521,8327,19550,"*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE 2008 'DELUXE EDITION' 2CD REMASTER ***

Some artists have a golden period - a stretch of albums that define them for decades to come.

CAT STEVENS had such a spell with Island Records in the Seventies - starting at the lovely and underrated ""Mona Bone Jakon"" LP in July 1970 - right through to November 1978's ""Back To Earth"" when the public had long since stopped listening. In-between this eight-year splurge - London's Steven Demetre Georgiou popped out a series of singer-songwriter albums that found their way into every bedsit and bedroom around the world (a girlfriend in collage had remarked that our Steven had eyes like a cat  hence the stage name).

After a pop start with Deram and Decca in the late Sixties - Cat Stevens switched to Island Records in early 1970 - acoustic-folk-souled his songwriting and the handsome troubadour and across the next five years in particular became huge with the public. Albums like 1972's ""Catch Bull At Four"", 1973's Foreigner and 1974's ""Buddah And The Chocolate Box"" are still remembered with real affection now in 2016 and charted big at the time  part of the James Taylor, Elton John and Carole King singer-songwriter movement sweeping the world in the early part of that fantastic decade.

But it was the duo of 1970's ""Tea For A Tillerman"" and the 1971 follow-up ""Teaser And The Firecat"" (Island Records in the UK and A&M in the USA) that seared him into the hearts of millions. These two beautifully written and well-recorded albums have always been the jewels in his catalogue crown. It's therefore hardly surprising that both have become recipients of a 2CD 'Deluxe Edition' Remaster from Universal - ""Tillerman"" in November 2008 with ""Teaser"" following in May 2009. Here are the Longer Boats coming to win us...

UK released November 2008 - ""Tea For The Tillerman: Deluxe Edition"" by CAT STEVENS on Universal/Island 00602517870888 (Barcode 602517870888) is a 2CD Expanded and Newly Remastered 'Deluxe Edition' with Eleven Bonus Tracks and plays out as follows:

Disc 1 (36:46 minutes):
1. Where Do The Children Play?
2. Hard Headed Woman
3. Wild World
4. Sad Lisa
5. Miles From Nowhere
6. But I Might Die Tonight
7. Longer Boats
8. Into White
9. On The Road To Find Out
10. Father And Son
11. Tea For The Tillerman
Tracks 1 to 11 are his fourth studio album ""Tea For The Tillerman"" - released November 1970 in the UK on Island Records ILPS 9135 and January 1971 in the USA on A&M Records SP-4280. Produced by PAUL SAMWELL-SMITH - it peaked at No. 20 in the UK and No. 8 in the USA.

Disc 2 (36:49 minutes):
1. Wild World (Demo Version, Recorded 1969)
2. Longer Boats (Live At The Troubadour, Recorded 1970)
3. Into White (Live At The Troubadour, Recorded 1970)
4. Miles From Nowhere (Demo Version, Recorded 1969)
5. Hard Headed Woman (Live in Japan, Recorded 1976)
6. Where Do The Children Play? (From the Majikat Earth Tour, Recorded 1976)
7. Sad Lisa (from the Majikat Earth Tour, Recorded 1976)
8. On The Road To Find Out (Live at KCET-TV, Recorded in Los Angeles, 1971)
9. Father And Son (from Yusef's Cafe, Recorded 2006)
10. Wild World (from Yusef's Cafe, Recorded 2006)
11. Tea For The Tillerman (Live At The BBC, Recorded 1970 for BBC Radio 1's ""Sounds Of The Seventies"" at the Playhouse Theatre)

This 'Deluxe Edition' had a plastic wrap (before Universal decided unwisely to ditch them) with 'Classic '70s Album Digitally Remastered...' sticker on the outside and a four-way foldout card digipak within - itself housed a beautifully laid-out 28-page oversized booklet. The inner gatefold photo of the original LP is spread across the flaps of the digipak with sepia photos adorning the other flaps (it's hardly great visually). The booklet is gorgeous. Page 3 has Cat's own ruminations on the album and its life/career changing effect on him - Pages 4 to 6 feature superb in-depth track-by-track explanations by original LP Producer PAUL SAMWELL-SMITH while principal band member and Guitarist ALUN DAVIES gives his eclectic take on the songs (Pages 8 and 9). The rest of the booklet reprints the lyrics alongside live photos and finally track-by-track breakdowns of the Bonus Material. The eleven-track Bonus Disc includes Previously Unreleased - two demos being the real prizes - almost as lovely as the finished articles. Songs from the 'Majikat' Tour have been released on an Eagle Vision DVD and the KCET Concert piece was out on a Weinerworld DVD ""Tea For The Tillerman Live"" - the rest are Previously Unreleased.

But the big news is a new June 2008 TED JENSEN Remaster done at Sterling Sound Studios in New York from the original two-track analogue master tapes - superseding the version he did on the May 2000 single disc Remaster series. This version is beautiful to listen too - a real Audio treat. Typically the bonus tracks are a mixture of the essential vs. the superfluous. His voice is gone on ""Sad Lisa"" while the Live At The BBC ""Tea For The Tillerman"" that ends the disc is less than a minute long and very hissy. The two live 'Yusef's Cafe' tracks are beautifully recorded and feature ""Wild World"" in both English and a different langue (original album player Alan Davies is part of the band for these sessions). But the real prize here for collectors and uber-fans is the two demos - both sweetly recorded and hugely impressive. Theres a warmth and magic coming off of them and you wish there was a whole album of these. The Troubadour live cuts are good too (just him and Alun Davies on guitars) - very clear and way better than say bootleg quality. As I write this (Thursday, 10 November 2016) - the Sci-Fi movie ""Arrival"" is opening today about twelve banana-shaped spaceships suddenly turning up on our capitol city lawns itching to communicate in squiggles. I mention this because in his first Troubadour song he announces that ""Longer Boats"" is about spaceships 'coming to win us' - 46 years before the film event! What a clever boy. But onto to the album...

""...Well I think it's fine building Jumbo planes...switch on Summer from a slot machine...but tell me...where do the children play?"" Cat opens the album with an environmental plea and in his May 2008 liner notes he comments that those passionate cries are still falling on 'tone-deaf ears' and unfortunately all present day evidence proves him right. What's not in dispute is the 'Audio'. My 'Pink Island' label 1970 Vinyl LP original and subsequent 1970's  'Pink-Rim Palm Tree Label' reissues always had low audio on ""Where Do The Children Play?"" - but this CD Remaster has gorgeous clarity and that acoustic bottom end when it kicks in is impressive. The strings on ""Hard Headed Woman"" are clearer and Harvey Burn's drums are almost 'too' good - a beautiful transfer. That huge piano on ""Sad Lisa"" fills your room and you forget just how passionate his vocals could be until you re-hear ""Miles From Nowhere"". Side 2's ""Longer Boats"" and the anthemic ""Father And Son"" will leave many tingling - both musically and lyrically.

""...Mary dropped her pants by the sand...and let the parson...come and take her hand...
But the soul of nobody knows...where the parson goes...""
I don't know where hes gone either.

""Tea For A Tillerman"" is a gorgeous album and the Audio on this 2008 'Deluxe Edition' Remaster has only hammered that home with knobs on. I don't how many times I'll return to Disc 2 in truth - but there are nuggets to be had there as well  period songs that fans will need and enjoy.

If you're not prepared to pay the extra - then simply plum for the May 2000 single CD remaster which has great audio too and can be found for less than three or four pounds in many places.

If however you're after the very best Audio and the fanboy in you wants that tasty presentation and those extras on Disc 2 (some of which are actually worth owning) - then this 2CD 'DE' version of Cat Stevens' ""Tea For The Tillerman"" is the Father and Son for you...",1478908800,4

95647,9574,14499,"In a letter, Beethoven referred to Franz Hoffmeister (1754-1812) as my most beloved brother. His fond reference may have more to do with the fact that Hoffmeister published his 1st Symphony and his 2nd Piano concerto rather than any affectionate sentiment. Besides running his publishing house which is still in existence today as the London firm of Peters Edition Ltd., Hoffmeister also wrote a little music. At least 8 operas, as many as 66 symphonies, about 57 string quartets and numerous other chamber works have been credited to him. Counted in in that impressive output are at least 25 flute concertos, including the 3 here.

Probably written some time before 1800 and published in 1803, the C Major Concerto is listed as No. 16. Trumpets and tympani give substance to the orchestral introduction of the opening Allegro, a sharp contrast to the long fluttering entrance of the flute. Characterized by a festive tone and a broad expansive sweep, this first movement features splendid work by the soloist, especially in the final cadenza, which incorporates elements of the opening theme. Written in C Minor, the dark Adagio drops the drums and brass to achieve a tragic air. Languid and sensuous, the central section brightens into the key of E Flat with some gorgeous tonality from the solo wind before a somber ending. With the full orchestra, the final Rondo is direct and straightforward, employing a bouncy irrepressibility that not even a brief excursion into A Minor can dim.

Dating from 1793 if not earlier, the concerto in G Major sports a leaner sound than the first work as the strings are accompanied only by horns and oboes. A sprawling Allegro opens, noteworthy for its juxtaposition of the wide ranging symphonic passages against the more nimble, intensely lyrical work of the flute. The concluding cadenza exhibits some outstanding work by the soloist, Bruno Meier, not surprising since he wrote it, as he did all the solo cadenzas on the this recording. Composed in G Minor, the elegiac Adagio seems to unfold as a funeral march. As the music shifts into B Flat, the grief disperses, but only fleetingly before the gloom descends for the final notes. A chirping flute initiates the closing Rondo Allegretto. Darting in and out of the more structured orchestral sections, the solo wind presents a wide array of virtuosic episodes in the carefree finale of the concerto recorded as No. 22.

Penned in D Major, Concerto No. 17 was likely written before the other two offerings. Buttressed by oboes and horns, the quirky Allegro starts with a formal orchestral introduction, but soon deteriorates into a startling hesitancy. Restarting with renewed vigor, the surprising timidity returns and only dissipates when the flute finally enters, bringing a resolute assurance to this clever 1st movement. Over delicately plucked strings, a gentle flute carries the ensuing Romanza: poco Adagio, one of the high points of the disc. Elastic phrasing allows the soloist to explore the subtleties of this jewel, venturing into darker regions as the music shifts into a minor keyed interlude. Using a precise, clipped attack, the jaunty Rondo Allegretto concludes the recording. Offering a bravura display of technique and rhythmic dexterity, the sprightly episodes roll by, retaining a relentlessly sunny tone.

On his 14 carat gold flute, Bruno Meier is superb. Nearly as good, the Prague Chamber Orchestra supplies sensitive and thoughtful backing while the 2013 release by Naxos is excellent, placing the solo wind front and center without shortchanging the symphonic support. One of the most popular composers during the Viennese Classical period, Hoffmeister fell into obscurity upon his death. He deserves better, and this second volume of his flute concertos, all world premieres, goes a long way to correct that oversight.",1478995200,4

That said, it holds up well on it's own and anyone not into harder prog rock probably could start hear before digesting their earlier work. It doesn't quite have the bite of previous albums, but is a more mellow and even more introspective excursion. Lyrics and musicianship is top notch as always. It didn't grab me at the first listen, but repeated listens reward with a deeper appreciation and understanding. I love that I can stream it through Amazon Prime.

In the case with Leon Russell, he was a really brilliant songwriter at the soul. Hard to believe, the world really lost a brilliant human being this past week. Alongside with the travesty and death of Leonard Cohen, he has been known more for his songs that he has had for other artists than himself. For someone who wrote with Elton John, Frank Sinatra, and had his song talent for others to share who've done his work in cover like Donny Hathaway, Whitney Houston and Joe Cocker, he was amazing. His most notable piece of work, A Song For You, still captures in the essence of somber sorrow. It has been a massive hit for so many from Ray Charles to Natalie Cole among others. He has worked with so many, and wrote for others from the eyes in sweet sadness, but Leon Russell with always be known for just one brilliant song at the heart. May we sing this for him.

95725,16271,16881,"Seemingly out of nowhere, but brewing just underneath the surface of Nashvilles obsession with the tailgates, trucks, dirt roads, hot chicks, and faux redneck rap that is Bro Country (and its various offshoots), there has been a slow but sure resurfacing of country music rooted in both traditional and progressive values.  Guys like Chris Stapleton, Jason Isbell, and Sturgill Simpson have been more or less leading this charge, but don't think the womenfolk are getting left behind.  If anything, as demonstrated over the past decade and a half, and counting Tift Merritt and Caitlin Rose among them, women are being seen as essential to this revitalization of the genre.  Enter Illinois native Margo Price with her album MIDWEST FARMERS DAUGHTER, one of the great albums of any genre by anybody in the year 2016.

Much like Canadian gal Lindi Ortega had done in 2015 with FADED GLORYVILLE, Margo has done with this album, by mixing in a variety of styles, rooted in classic 1960s/1970s country, of the Bakersfield honky-tonk variety, but including a fair amount of Memphis/Muscle Shoals R&B and old-school country-rock of the Linda Ronstadt/Emmylou Harris variety as well.  Margo has had a fairly rough life up to this point (even seeing the wrong side of a jail cell), one that screams the story of a great C&W song, but being the survivor she is, of both jail and heartbreaks galore, she brings that to vivid life.  She took it upon herself to record MIDWEST FARMERS DAUGHTER in the halls of Sun Studios in Memphis, the place where Elvis made his groundbreaking recordings that would help set the tone for American popular music in the second half of the 20th century, and this more than explains the musical mixings she engages in.  Songs like About To Find Out and Since You Put Me Down are classic-sounding honky-tonk material in a modern context.  Meanwhile, Weekender is a perfectly dissolute song about her time in jail, while Hurtin (On The Bottle), a co-write of Margos with the aforementioned Caitlin Rose, is another honky-tonk C&W masterpiece.  Other songs like Four Years Of Chances have a Southern R&B feel to them.

In any case, this isn't the sort of album thats likely to get too much airplay, on corporate country radio at least.  While there are no F-bombs dropped, there is a little bit of language in some of the songs lyrics that would give MIDWEST FARMERS DAUGHTER the equivalent of the MPAAs PG rating.  And the combination of Telecaster twang and pedal steel guitar, a hallmark of classic 1960s Bakersfield honky-tonk and 1970s L.A. country-rock, must by now sound alien to people blinded by the processed junk of Jason Aldean, Luke Bryan, and Florida-Georgia Line (to name just three Bromeister acts).  Still, all in all, thanks to Margos authenticity and a voice that is naturalistic, MIDWEST FARMERS DAUGHTER has taken it all the way down the field for the touchdown.  It is essential listening, whether you're a fan of traditional country, a fan of progressive country, or, indeed, both.",1479081600,5
95726,6684,9999,"Muse just keeps getting better and better with each album. ""Drones"" is co-produced by Robert ""Mutt"" Lange, which I must admit, I had my reservations about. He was a popular music producer in the '80s, but he lost credibility for me later in his career, but thankfully his ""studio magic"" is back in a big way with ""Drones"". This is STILL a Muse album so expect big and crazy guitars riffs, catchy melodies, and a nostalgic but modern sound. You can hear a little of that '80s nostalgia on ""Mercy"" (a haunting and deeply emotional mid-tempo track) and ""Dead Inside"" (a synth-heavy juggernaut about a broken relationship). There are some beautiful ballads like ""Aftermath"" and ""Drones"" (the harmonies are insane). ""The Globalist"" is a 10+ minute masterpiece. Probably the most experimental track. I love the whistling intro, piano riff, sound effects, and string arrangement. Matthew Bellamy's voice is still in fine form. HE CAN SING ANYTHING. His range is astounding and HUGE. A lot of people complained about the lyrics on ""Drones"" but I think they are good. Simple but good. The lyrics on ""Psycho"" are NOT terrible, they are very tongue-in-cheek. Bellamy doesn't take himself too seriously. It's good he has a sense of humor. ""Psycho"" is simply amazing but I could've done without the drill sergeant dialogue (too distracting). The verses are gorgeous and the hook is awesome. And that riff! Wow. ""Reapers"" is the BEST track. It's another song that has mind-blowing riffs. Bellamy puts his falsetto to good use on the chorus. Again, wow. ""Defector"" and ""The Handler"" are also hard-hitting tracks. Great arrangements and the chord changes are impressive. ""Revolt"" is a solid mid-tempo track. I like the message of the song. Very inspiring. Is there anything this band can't do? They are insanely talented. ""Drones"" is a concept album. Usually concept albums are a hit-or-miss for me, but ""Drones"" works because the theme and tone of the album is ever-present. This album is political but NOT in an obnoxious or self-righteous way. It's dark, edgy, and above all else, HIGHLY entertaining. BUY. THIS. ALBUM. NOW.  Enjoy!",1479168000,5

I wound up sitting in my car with her, talking to her for some 2-3 hours, trying to convince her not to send a 'Dear John Letter' to her boyfriend in Vietnam. I had the radio on at a low volume. When I was almost done with my pitch, this song came on. I turned up a little for her to hear it better. She suddenly had tears running down her, sobbing a little. She turned the radio off. She hugged me briefly, kissing me on the cheek. She opened the car door and got out. She turned around and said: ""Thank you. Roger. I won't send this letter. It would be very cruel of me to do that. You see, I was so afraid to lose him. Instead, I will write him to tell him how much I love him and how much I miss him. Then I will hope for the best. Thank you so much, Roger, for rattling my cage."" Then she scurried away. Ten months later, they got married, in spite of his left leg missing.",1479168000,5

95809,5633,18069,"At 99 cents, what's not to like?! Actually this is a great, eclectic collection of piano rags, most by Scott Joplin and played by the ragtime expert and composer William Bolcom, who plays them in a similar way as Joshua Rifkin: slow and easy, the way Joplin wanted. No honkytonk saloon music here! Also, there are rags by Joseph Lamb and some others including female composers and pianists. As a bonus, several piano works of the American composer and salon pianist (America's Chopin!) Louis Moreau Gottschalk. These are not rags but apparently Gottschalk was a major influence on the ragtime music movement, especially Joplin. They are wonderful pre-ragtime selections from the latter half of the 19th century, and were popular in the salons of the upper crust. Salon piano music was sort of the pop instrumental music of its time, but Gottschalk was a serious composer as well. These pieces show it. They are melodic--like good ragtime--and easy on the ears. Many of his songs (like The Dying Poet) were used as background for silent movies and became so common as to be cliche, thus the loss of popularity for Gottschalk's music (and other salon music) until revivals began in the late 20th century. Eugene List, a classical pianist, performs the Gottschalk.

95840,1909,19574,"I first reviewed the individual components of this ""Ring"" tetralogy separately, but have now collated those reviews as per below, slightly modified, as the best way of acquiring it is via this super bargain edition.

The individual box-sets of this ""Ring"" are becoming harder to find, but the cycle as a whole is still available very cheaply; you could do a great deal worse than invest in it to hear this music done justice by a relatively unknown but highly proficient cast. This might not be a first choice when considered alongside starrier, prestige recordings and it is true that if you want a budget ""Ring"" there are now other options, especially B&ouml;hm's, but I maintain that this makes a fine introduction for any Wagner tyro and a great supplement for the seasoned collector. It is wholly convincing and represents extraordinary value.

Das Rheingold:

This super-budget ""Ring"" was not especially highly regarded at the time of its appearance in the late 60's, especially in the wake of Solti's blockbuster set, but with the passage of time we must surely show greater appreciation for such secure, vividly articulated singing as we hear in this first instalment.

The clean, bright, sound is the product of the placement of just two microphones and there are some nice effects which mimic Decca's, such as the reverberation surrounding Alberich's voice when he commands and terrifies the Nibelungen hoard - and the Alberich here is second only to Neidlinger for the intensity of his singing. None of the singers is a household name or star, although some were regulars on the Wagner circuit and made some valuable recordings; all are native German speakers except for the distinguished Japanese bass Takao Okamura who also sang Verdi bass parts very well. His black Fafner is matched by Otto von Rohr's old school Fasolt. The vibrancy of the Rhinedaughters' singing instantly make the listener sit up and the Wotan is excellent if hardly charismatic or thrilling in the way that the greatest bass-baritones can be. The secondary roles are taken with distinction; there are three first rate tenors as Froh, Mime and Loge - the latter being Fritz Uhl, best known for his ""Tristan"" eight years earlier with Nilsson under Solti; here he lightens his voice and deliberately assumes a more whining tone as he had already long been singing Heldentenor roles. The Donner makes his mark in his hammer-strike passage towards the end. Ursua Boese is not ideally sepulchral as Erda but still impressive. The Fricka is Ruth Hesse, who went on to have a distinguished career. Only the Freia is a little shrill but not damagingly so. All in all, this is a cast which we would kill to hear today, given the dearth of true Wagnerian voices.

The scratch orchestra, made up of Prague bands and local German orchestras, is very fine and if Swarowsky's conducting is somewhat literal and straightforward - some big moments pass rather prosaically - nor is he irritatingly interventionist and much of the time one is simply listening to Wagner as he is meant to go.

This can be picked up for ridiculously little and makes a satisfying first introduction to a masterwork.

This is recorded in more than acceptable, occasionally slightly wiry, stereo sound, as you may hear from the superb double basses and timpani in the Prelude. Swarowsky goes on to conduct the love music with swelling passion although later some of the narratives need more pace and bite to avoid becoming longueurs. However, the crucial climaxes to Acts 1 and 3 are handled very well, even if in the latter there is some roughness in the otherwise powerful singing of the Wotan, Rolf Polke. He can strain and even yell on his top G flats, yet he is an excellent vocal actor, really makes something of the Act 3 narration which can drag, and his Farewell is very touching and expressive; ""So kusst er die Gottheit von dir"" is simply magical in its tenderness. Gerald McKee puts in a great few days' work as Siegmund. His legato could be smoother but he has considerable heft and power at his disposal; the sustained cries of ""W&auml;lse"" are thrilling. His delivery of text can border on the mechanical and stentorian but he finds more expressiveness when caring for his twin in their flight. His Br&uuml;nnhilde makes a terrific impact on her first entry with her ""Hojo-to-hos"", cleverly exploiting the break between her registers to yodel magnificently. She can become a tad unsteady but is generally very impressive. She is backed by a first rate team of Valkyries. The Fricka, Ruth Hesse has a big, hooty, powerful mezzo and makes strong impression as the wronged and indignant goddess. Otto von Rohr lives up to his name with his large, purring bass, his lowering, glowering presence oozing menace. Ditha Sommer is considerably more rewarding here as Sieglinde than she is as Gutrune later in the cycle; her soprano can be both fruity and shrill - its registration is not ideally developed - but she is firm and involved, rather in the Rysanek school of protrayal.

Siegfried:

First of all, I must contradict a previous reviewer who states that ""there are no world class voices here""; I guarantee that if any of the three lead singers were available to sing in modern Wagnerian productions they would be fighting off offers for years to come. Furthermore, we may hear a first class Mime with top notes to rival his Siegfried - in fact both tenors hit notes head on without sliding - and the ability to whine and moan without being irritating, an Alberich second only to Neidlinger despite a bit of swooping, an excellent Woodbird and a superb Fafner in the great Japanese bass Takao Okamura. It is true that Gerald McKee is audibly stretched in the Forging Scene but he gets there, is touchingly tender and boyish in the Forest Murmurs and exhibits remarkable reliability and security in the fiendishly taxing eponymous role. Kniplova has a big, grainy sound which verges on the unwieldy, especially when her vibrato starts to obtrude, but she also has a really solid lower register and a top with that laser penetration essential to a really good Br&uuml;nnhilde. The Wanderer is the highly competent and experienced Rolf Polke, who sometimes skimps top notes but is generally resonant, tonally centred and very impressive. He might not rival the very best Wotans; he lacks London's heft and Hotter's subtlety with the text, but we are talking about comparisons with the very greatest artist ever to assume that role; this remains a noble assumption.

There has been talk of this being a scratch orchestra assembled haphazardly just for this very rushed recording project but it is really much better than that, being an amalgam of some of the best Czech and German musicians available, and recording the whole ""Ring"" all of a piece plus ""Lohengrin"" too over a mere four weeks lent a kind of live immediacy and tension to proceedings. Hans Swarowsky keeps things moving but manages some telling effects, such as the very atmospheric opening, and he finds both poetry and detail in the more lyrical sections of the score, such as in the aforementioned ""Forest Murmurs"" where McKee acquits himself so well, and the Transformation scene between the smashing of Wotan's spear and Siegfried's discovery of the firewall. Indeed, again despite some acerbic observations from a couple reviewers who I suspect hear want they want to hear from what was so obviously always a budget recording, I hear little wrong with Swarowsky's direction and the climax to this opera really delivers.

The simple two-mike placement gives more than adequate stereo sound.

G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung:

Always a bargain edition, this is currently available for very little either individually as per here on Weltbild Classics or as a set on the Profil label, both well remastered. It completes an eminently satisfying and distinctly under-rated cycle recorded in haste as something of a scratch recording over a few days in 1968 under the vastly experienced mentor-teacher-conductor Hans Swarowsky. That it is cast in strength is immediately apparent, even if the artists are no longer well known today. I don't think either principal recorded much else but they were established Wagner singers on the circuit, with big, slightly blowsy voices and they acquit themselves magnificently. There is a slight whine in Gerald McKee's Heldentenor, some occasional approximation of notes and rhythms and a few slips in his German but he is the real thing and manages all the difficult passages, including the top C on ""Hoiho"". I'm not surprised that he sounds a bit tired in the scene where he swears upon Hagen's spear point and yells a bit, but generally he is very satisfactory and would be a star today.

Nadezda Kniplova is really very impressive at times, sometimes sounding like Nilsson in the middle of her voice though occasionally letting a rather plaintive tone obtrude. Like her Siegfried,she has all the notes and is at her best for the climax of the opera. I find her German clear, well enunciated and serviceable. Her vibrato can become too prominent which makes her sound a bit matronly but there is power and stamina aplenty. She, too, delivers on her top C on ""Heil"" in the opening love duet. It's a pleasure to listen to two such hefty voices rather than the pale substitutes fielded too often these days.

The rest of the cast, with the exception of Ditha Sommer's wobbly, strident Gutrune, is superb. We start with three very strong-voiced Norns and later hear three delightful Rhinedaughters. The Gunther - also a fine Donner in ""Das Rheingold"" - is almost too virile and nobly voiced for such a craven coward and often sounds rather too like Otto von Rohr, the a black, baleful Hagen - a properly menacing basso profondo - but they are terrific with Kniplova in the crucial vengeance oath scene. The Alberich,as in ""Das Rheingold"" is second only to Neidlinger for biting scorn and rage and the scene where he appears to Hagen in his dream is superb in its atmosphere and word-painting.

I like Swarowsky's non-interventionist conducting; he never lingers and while listening I simply forgot to note any ""interpretation"" as it all proceeded so naturally. Either he or the recording brings out some pleasing detail like the piccolo's top line in the Rhine Journey. The orchestra is wonderful, especially the brass; sample the Prelude to Act II to hear their quality. It is matched by the spiritedness of the Vienna State Opera chorus who could not be lustier in the Act II ""Hoi-hos"" scene.",1479168000,4

He did not like what I did to him. Anyway, so I heard this song. It lifted my spirits right up. Right then and there, I decided to stick to music and stay away from politics.

I like the sort of old swing feeling of the music with piano and horns. The problem for me is that it sounds ""muddy"" - the recording is lifeless. My home system is pretty revealing of bad recordings (sometimes I wish it were more forgiving of poor recordings). I wish I could magically remaster this cd. Actually, it might sound better through my old Grado headphones, which tend to pump up the mids and highs some.",1479340800,3

96029,16842,14743,"That's 4 and add a half Stars, okay?So glad to once again own a copy of Stoneground's ""Family Album"" on CD now. Thank you Amazon and BGO for re- issuing a fine album from yesteryear!!! Am listening now to The Move's ""Looking On "" that arrived today as well. Well, what to say...? Stoneground was definitely a band of Hippies and Sal Valentino of the former Beau Brummel's who did the superlative song "" Laugh, Laugh"" , about the only song they did that was ever worthwhile, to my ears anyway. The Medicine Ball Caravan they they toured the USA with were a rolling Kool-Aide Acid Test , much like Mr. Kesey's Crew( who went on to sell yogurt before it was fashionable in Eugene OR under the label Nancy's Yogurt) Was it ""Safe As Milk""? Let's just say I never got "" High "" sampling his new product...stingy! Anyway, having this album back in my collection is like running into a dear old friend again, so I guess it makes me part of the Family,so to speak. Is it their best album...no (altho BGO hasn't remastered a bad album yet, considering the source material they have to deal with, great Company by the way...they care!)so, what is their very best album from Warner Bros. Record label? It is an album claimed to never have been released as their debut according to Collector's Choice Music in their booklet info for the ""s/t "" disc. Hogwash!' Sorry, Groundhogs! I actually owned the disc in prehistoric times (as an old dinosaur I can say that), it featured George Harrison playing on it with them and the cover art showed the group sitting around in a circle in a brown desert, I believe with their guitars stretched out in the circle if I remember correctly. Perhaps the Masters have been lost, if not, I look forward to BGO getting ahold of it...From Warner Bros. ?) and issuing it before I end up in the Big Tar-Pit!...in other wierds, ""Soon!"" Until then this will do quite nicely! Happy Ear Candy Holiday to all, An Olde Hippie and Contentedly Politcally Incorrect",1479427200,4

96060,8731,19589,Another great album! Loved it! Keep up!,1479427200,5
96061,313,19589,"Bruno Mars first came to my attention when I heard ""The Lazy Song"" performed by a local group called The Blast Addicts. It was around the time of the man's second album that I went back to listen to the first. He has a very soulful sound and is a talented songwriter. There were times where he did seem to concentrate on the novelty aspects of his music. Especially when it came to being eclectic. Recently however,he upped the strong 80's boogie/electro funk quotient in his music with his Mark Ronson collaboration ""Uptown Funk"". And with a full live band in tow,this sound became the general template for this new third album of his.

""24k Magic"" starts off the album with a pounding Vocorder/synthesizer based electro funk jam. ""Chunky"" adds a simple but effective electric bass line with more of a lush jazz/funk shuffle about it. ""Perm"" gets into a straight up James Brown type groove with really hit horns. ""Versace On The Floor"" and ""Calling All The Lovelies"" are electronically arranged mid tempo slow jams while the slower ""Straight Up & Down"" and the uptempo ""Finese"" have something I never thought would return: a new jack swing rhythm.  The closer ""Too Good To Say Goodbye"" has an electric sitar based Thom Bell Philly ballad flavor while ""That's What I Like"" has a more hip-hop/trap flavor with a very singable melody.

Musically speaking,this album is possibly the best and most consistent Bruno Mars has made thus far. He's primarily exploring mid 80's electro funk on these songs. Yet he also dabbles in musical innovations from later in the decade too. Even the CD label has a retro 80's flavor. Whether recorded with the band or with one or two people,most of the album has a superb flow. Lyrically,the songs are steeped in the good humored party crew mentality. So there no deep songs here. Though some of the ballads have a strong romantic side to them.. In the end,it points mostly to Bruno Mars's musical strengths than anything else. And provides a solid template for the music he has in store for his in the future.",1479427200,5
96062,4379,18022,Awsome sound track,1479427200,5
96063,3062,5773,"Love this song too. I Worship every morning listening to it, sometimes all day too!!",1479427200,5

96068,2600,19589,"I love this new album by Bruno Mars. ""24K Magic"" is an excellent dance tune.  This song gets me moving. ""Versace On The Floor"" is a sensual  jam of a song. ""Perm"" has a funky  beat that I love. ""Perm"" is going to be my new work out song in the morning.  ""Chunky"" is a fun song that celebrates all the full figured women in the world. ""Straight Up and Down"" is a song is another song that honors all the lovely ladies everywhere. ""Too Good To Say Goodbye"" is a smooth jam of a song.  ""Calling All My Lovelies"" is a song that reminds me to take a more relaxed attitude when I am trying to romance a girl. ""Finesse"" is a song about the confidence a woman gives a man when she is with him. ""That's What I Like"" is a great song about all the things that can create a romantic atmosphere.  I love this new music from Bruno Mars.  All of these songs are so enjoyable.",1479427200,5
96069,2320,19589,"Bruno has always been of my favorite artists, the way he mixes soul with those vocals are amazing! It has been awhile since I enjoyed every song from an album, but this one does not disappoint. Think the 60's with a new twist to it equals this entire album, it is very retro sounding. I am loving the type of songs that are included, including the ballad Versace on the floor!",1479427200,5
96070,231,19589,"Bruno Mars is clearly One of the Baddest artists going today. as a songwriter, singer and musician not to mention as  a live act he got his thing together.  he came back with an album which was a tribute to the 80's and 90's and he wears his many influences on his sleeve. however he has his touch and one thing is that certain is that he can tap into the pulse of what is happening and yet take it back. he got more jams here which are on point. he got himself a  really  good album here and Bruno is versatile enough to last a really long tine and  he can beat you in various ways. he still is quite young in his career,however you can sense a artist who has a old school vibe with a new school approach which will be years of  greatness still to come.",1479427200,4

1. The song skips several times at the beginning.
2. Intermittent rap insert. Better if just spoken in adult words and phases 3. The use of profanity. God doesn't have a last name. Profanity in rap probably the reason its sells.",1479513600,2

Somehow Israel Kamakawiwo'ole (try to pronunce it!) made this song a hit once again, because of his incredible rendition.  Listen to it a few times eyes closed.  You might cry, even if you are a big guy who does not cry.",1479513600,5
96114,5310,19592,"Before I knew this gorgeous side of Ben Lukas Boysen there was a stunning side of Hecq. There was his glitched out, tecked out, abstract IDM project with releases on Hymen and Ad Noiseam, pushing the boundaries of electronic music into imagined landscapes and experimental planes. There was, indeed, my obsession with his intricately programmed sonic journeys and surgical beats that is until Night Falls (Hymen, 2008) blew my mind, with Boysens aptitude for ambiance and cinematic poise. Since then, reserved for releases under his real name, Boysen unleashed true motion picture soundtracks and contemporary compositions for stage and screen. This year, the beloved Erased Tapes picks up the latest gem from Ben Lukas Boysen, for his modern classical offering, which truly will remain within our hearts.

Spells is only about 45 minutes in length, and features eight exquisite pieces centered around piano, accompanying cello, guitar, harp, and electronics. At the heart of the album is the harmonic essence of Boysens genius, taking the listener deeper into his picturesque worlds, cleverly combining acoustic with synthetic, until the two blend into music that simply carries one away. As a score for my morning headphone commute, Spells traverses the intricate corners of my psyche, peeling back the layers of dust that have covered my most intimate senses. This is music from which I can not hide, revealing all of the essential, elemental, and innate, penetrating my soul with its profound truth, leaving me helpless, bare and raw.

Mixed and mastered at the Durton Studio by his fellow label mate, dear friend, and by now world renown pianist, Nils Frahm, Spells feels like a natural performance of musicians gathered with their instruments, with Boysen centered at the piano but nothing could be further from the truth. The pieces feature sampled programmed piano, each note deliberately adjusted to maintain that human feel. This latter observation is not meant to reduce the beauty of the record, nor is it mean to negatively reflect on its execution. If anything, it is quite the opposite  a compliment of transcendence beyond ones limitations in achieving a timeless sound, that even these ears would fool.

""Spells merges programmed piano pieces with live instruments, combining the controllable technical world and the often unpredictable aspects of live improvisation. In some ways it continues where his underground debut Gravity left off, though a lot of weight is lifted, making room for a lighter and more energetic listen. [] Ben is not a master pianist like his dear friend, Nils Frahm, but his sound collages are so meticulously designed that after hearing the result an impressed Nils declared: from now on, if anyone asks  this is a real piano.

I am already confident that this record will appear on my best of the year lists, so its only applicable for you to get familiar with it right now. Meanwhile, hats off to Robert Raths of Erased Tapes for snatching yet another amazing release for his labels catalog  the man has an ear for talent and a eye for scrupulous curation  its no wonder that each and every album on the imprint continues to build up a global following and celebrated praise. Thanks again for all the music  its a gift we can not bound.",1479513600,5

It's classic Carlin.  I know that he always workshopped his bits, polishing them to perfection, so it's obvious that this show was a work-in-progress and would only get better as he honed his words for optimal effect.  However, it's perfect to me just the way it is.  The older bits at the top of the CD are great to hear, but George really didn't do it for me until he threw away the script and spoke from his heart and his fertile imagination.",1479513600,5

96198,3897,18464,"16 months after ""Filaments"", a spectacular odyssey through fascinating space expanses, one of the undisputable ambient innovators returns with another jewel. On ""What We Left Behind"" CD, as displayed by its title, Robert Rich transforms his dreams about the Mother Earth when the humankind is gone, with a crow as a spirit guide, into an exquisitely sophisticated soundsculptures, showcasing his continuous musical virtuosity. Out since May 2016 on Robert's Soundscape Productions, the CD comes, as usual, in a really gorgeous 6-panel digipak masterly designed by a frequent collaborator John Bergin exhibiting stunning cover art by Ibizan painter Romanie Sanchez, who has already contributed her amazing art to two collaborative releases by Alio Die & Paralled Worlds ""Circo Divino"" and ""Elusive Metaphor"". So with such visual power it's quite obvious the first big points are awarded already, but this is nothing new when it goes to Robert Rich's CDs. Nowadays, when many physical items are released in reduced quality, we must be really grateful for such consistent artful bliss. Bravo, Romanie, John & Robert!!!

""Profligate Earth"" unfolds with authentic trademarking insignias, it simply can't be anyone else but Robert Rich! Filigree organic sounds masterfully amalgamate with nebulous blankets and intangibly subtle rhythm motifs, while guarded by abstractions of Chari Chuang's voice (remember Chari Chuang's virtuosic performance on ""Medicine Box""?). A very pleasant intro with top-notch sound quality again delivered! Signature flute work returns (after absence on ""Filaments"" album) and announces ""Raku"" and commingles with gentle primordial rumblings, gossamer tribal patterns and captivating biotic quietudes. Richly enigmatic composition! ""Voice Of Rust"" keeps on its primal path, when merging yearning flute with languishingly rumbling artifacts. ""Soft Rains Fall"" excels with tremendous lap steel guitar artistry, when melting earmarking ethereal choir nuances with balmy beats, while soothing atmospheric blankets are riding atop. This is Robert Rich at the very top of his immersing soundmagic!!! Shorter ""Rhizome"" dwells in perplexingly primordial terrains. ""Transpiration"" is awakened by weirdly enrapturing sound fragments of child-like voice, but soon the center stage is stolen by utterly evocative flute, a truly genuine hallmark, which is meticulously bridged with monochromatic drone, phantasmal helixes and magnetizing tribal drumming. Over 5 minutes of pure aural ecstasy awaits here, a Hall of Fame track!!! The next composition, ""Corvid Collections"", melts mysterious flute motifs, subterranean drum patterns and contemplative tinkles. ""Aerial On Warm Seas"", with 9:08 the longest piece on the album, is driven by magnificently melancholic lap steel cries, which later metamorphose into powerfully intense, nearly transcendental stratums and then evanescing through bizarrely colored phantasmagoric sceneries back to weeping loneliness. This is a fully rewarding venture into unmistakable sonic domains demonstrating uniquely distinctive artistry of its sole protagonist. Hats off to you, Robert!!! ""Never Hunger"" reveals with deep drumming, longing flute and grieving lap steel guitar. Credited on last two tracks is Robert's Californian kindred spirit Forrest Fang for used abstractions of his performance on cmb' (a Turkish stringed instrument). ""After Us"" dives into unfathomable depths with its static drone, distant hums and diaphanously rustling embellishments. 6-minute title track ""What We Left Behind"" incorporates pulsing laid-back rhythms coupled with calmly sweeping expansive washes and strikingly poignant lap steel vistas. Beauty!!! ""Meeting Face To Face"" starts serenely with slightly exotic fragranced strings, which conjugate with panoptic angelic lap steel choirs and warmly cinematic horizons. A truly gorgeous conclusion!

Robert Rich is known for his perfection and consistency and ""What We Left Behind"" is a perfect example of his superiorly creative musicianship. A quite colorful 62-minute recording, which showcases all essential insignias of this Californian. They are fully blossoming and wealthily infused by 3 and a half decades of his stellar recording career. Thank you, Maestro!!! ""What We Left Behind"" is another true piece of art by Robert Rich, which will delight your eyes and ears!!! And by the way, since yesterday the newest CD by Robert Rich entitled ""Vestiges"" is available for order. A new album after 7 months? Wow, that's a quite unusual for this sonic explorer. I can't wait!!!

96213,16859,19589,"Maybe it's me, but I just expected a much stronger album from Bruno Mars than what he put out on this album. The first two tracks are very good, but then you start to hear song's that are so much like stuff from his first album and there are a few tracks that sound so Jackson 5 ish or very New Edition like. Bruno is so talented and you hear it vocally. I just think he's going backwards with too many of the songs instead of trying new things musically he seems to be imitating to much of the sound and groups of the 80's (The Time, New Edition, The Jackson 5) etc. All in all, it's not a bad album but there's nothing new or exciting about it either.",1479600000,2

96219,524,19598,"""Light Has Come"" is a collection of thirteen Christmas carols (two are combined into a medley) arranged and performed for solo piano by John Albert Thomas. Thomas mentions in the liner notes that Christmas was a sacred time for his family and how much he always enjoyed getting together with his church family to sing Christmas hymns. For this album, I decided to add my own style to some of those favorites It is my way of worshipping the Light who came into the world. I hope it brings peace to your heart as well. The album was recorded at Piano Haven Studios in Sedona, AZ on Joe Bongiornos wonderful Shigeru Kawai grand piano. The piano sound is warm and velvety-smooth - a perfect match for Thomas soulful arrangements and playing style. The arrangements are not flashy, but are full and rich, expressing the beauty of the melodies and the religious significance of the songs rather than being party music. Thomas has assembled an interesting combination of songs, most of which are familiar, but there are a few less-often heard gems as well.

""Light Has Come"" begins with O Holy Night. I find it really interesting that when I was growing up, this gorgeous song always seemed to be presented in a dark, almost tragic setting. Over the past couple of decades, the mood of the song has lightened considerably, and Thomas arrangement is almost light-hearted and celebratory, which seems right. Although the title sounds depressing, In the Bleak Midwinter conveys the stillness and quiet of a winter landscape. Thomas arrangement is very peaceful and very beautiful. Go Tell It on the Mountain is light and playful. How Great Our Joy and Break Forth, O Beauteous Heavenly Light were not familiar to me, but both are beautiful traditional German carols with reflective, haunting melodies. Silent Night makes great use of the piano dampers to create a feeling of shimmering stillness and open space - an exceptionally nice arrangement of this Christmas standard. Picardy/Carol of the Bells is the medley, and its another haunting beauty. Picardy is an old French carol and the melody has been used for several carols, including Let All Mortal Flesh Keep Silence. Im always amazed at how well Carol of the Bells adapts to so many different styles and treatments, and this one is exceptional - my favorite track on the album! It Came Upon the Midnight Clear is light and joyful, bringing this lovely Christmas album to a close with a smile.

""Light Has Come"" would be a beautiful addition to any collection of Christmas music and is sure to add musical joy to the season for years to come. Recommended!",1479600000,5

It must be one of the milestones in the Hall, just for its significance (how often does an orchestra do a set of Bruckner in a short span) and its quality (Barenboim has to be considered one of today's top conductors of Bruckner's Symphonies).  These recordings, from what I can tell only available digitally, are magnificent.  The sound of the orchestra is glorious with incredible balance between the strings, woodwinds, and a colorful brass section.  All of the most popular symphonies are performed at a very high level.  The fourth is both quite commanding and reflective.  The seventh is gorgeous.  The ninth is epic - with an ending fitting as Bruckner seems to be saying goodbye with grace and glory (not exactly the way Tchaikovsky and Mahler chose to do so).  But that is not even a snapshot of the set, as this is far too mammoth a set of glorious works to put into words.  Just too stand out - well done!",1479772800,5

96322,9574,12836,"A member of one of the most famous families from Bohemia, Franz Benda (1709-1789) entered into the service of Frederick the Great in 1732. As a violin master, he played some 50,000 performances over a forty year period. He also wrote a lot of violin music, 110 solo capriccios, at least 150 sonatas, 31 duets and some 28 concertos, including this one in D Major.

With a crisply articulated intro, the Allegro ma non molto features a harpsichord continuo and string dominated orchestral support. As a transitional work from the Baroque, it contains more interplay between the single violin and the symphonic tutti than was the norm for the prevalent Italian style. Smoothly flowing, Bendas writing for the solo string is virtuosic without being showy, letting the melodic lines develop naturally. In the minor keyed Largo, the sweep of the orchestral accompaniment lends a somber weight to the throbbing vibrato of Gabriela Demeterova. With a dramatic pathos in the uppermost register, she brings a sorrowful sweetness in her tone that must be similar to the reported quality that set apart Bendas adagio playing. Horns appear for the brisk finale, a bright Allegro with bravura fiddling as the single violin drifts high on the E string.

A generation or two later, Bohemian born Vaclav Pichl (1741-1805) studied philosophy and theology in Prague before accepting a musical directorship in Milan. After 21 years, he returned to Vienna and died while playing a violin concerto at the Lobkowitz Palace.
His D Major Concerto Op. 3, No. 1 opens with a marching Allegro sostenuto, clipped and precise. While still employing the harpsichord as continuo, the writing finds even greater collaboration between the soloist and orchestra, engaging in extensive rhythmic interactions and trading melodic ideas, including one haunting echo in minor. A higher degree of technical proficiency of the single violin is also required.

A minor keyed charmer, the following Adagio finds striking support in the lower strings with a lovely countermelody while the ethereal vibrato of the solo sounds so much like the beating of angel wings. Ending the 2nd movement on an open cadence sets up a smooth transition as the resolution occurs in the sweetly pure tones from the violin, the very first notes of the concluding Rondo. Interrupting the relentless drive in the lower strings, a brief passage in minor offers a dark interlude in an otherwise cheery finale.

By another Bohemian, the final concerto represents the culmination of the Viennese High Classical style. Renowned as a teacher and violin virtuoso, Antonin Vranicky (1761-1820) composed some outstanding chamber music and challenging concertos, one of which is the C Major included on this recording.

Using tympani and winds to create a broader palette of orchestral colors, the work begins with a bold Allegro giusto. Amid a longer, more extensive development section, the soloist shines in the fiendishly difficult passage work while in the reverential Adagio that follows, the writing stretches the upper reaches of the instruments register. After a chorale like start, the weeping violin carries the movement until gentle horns lead to a serene close. Marked Alla Pollacca- Allegretto, the finale is a frisky Polish folk dance. With an appealing stutter step in the rhythm, this 3rd movement features a brief mournful interlude, dazzling flourishes from the violin and a rousing finish.

The original recording from 1995 from Supraphon is fine, placing the solo violin close enough for the intimate slower sections to be sharp and clear. Under the able artistic direction of Milan Lajcik, the Prague Chamber Orchestra brings an accomplished reading to their fellow countrymens concertos. But the spotlight rightfully belongs to the exquisite work of Gabriela Demeterova. This fine traversal of the development of the Viennese violin concerto is testimony to her artistry.

Please note that the 2008 edition includes a video bonus track of the bold Allegro giusto from Vranickys concerto in C Major.",1479772800,5

96352,2191,19170,"II is the second album by pianist and composer, Andy Iorio, who debuted with After the Rain in 2010. Comprised of twelve compositions having one word titles, each capturing a mood, moment or emotional expression, the album features a mix of both piano and strings courtesy of Matthew Johnson on violin and viola, as well as solo piano pieces throughout.

Opening is carried along by a brisk piano melody underscored by viola, which are eventually joined by violin in a sorrowful serenade. Seemingly inspired by another era, the piece bears notable neoclassical signatures along with a bit of a gothic semblance. Continuing in this mode is Burn, which likewise exudes a certain cinematic quality that brings to mind an old black and white film. Descent follows next and is easily my favorite composition herein. Characterized by hauntingly ubiquitous chord progressions in which suspended strings hover above a flowing piano melody that repeatedly rises and falls throughout, the mood of the piece almost feels a bit noir, bringing to mind images of passer-byers on cobblestone streets of an old city. The waltzing Silhouettes is among a handful of solo piano compositions of which are generally less forlorn than those accompanied by strings. Whereas the albums piano ensemble pieces skew more towards the melancholic and neoclassical, their solo piano counterparts possess more contemporary melodies that are comparatively brighter and more sentimental. The final piece, Closing, opens with an encroaching fog of strings that soon introduce somewhat languid piano notes and a flute-like instrument. An extended pause of silence occupies the middle part of the track, before revealing a hidden solo piano piece towards its seemingly daybreak conclusion.

Capturing an elegant balance of shadow and light, Andy Iorio has demonstrated a keen ability to convey often dramatic emotional expressions within a generally subtle and perfectly understated musical framework. Overall solemn and purposeful with lighter moments of hope interspersed throughout, II is a superbly crafted album that will appeal, especially, to many fans of Phillip Glass, Ludovico Einaudi and piano-based soundtrack music!",1479772800,5

This great band consists of Robert Greer on vocals and guitar, Jesse Langlais on banjo and vocals, Bobby Britt on fiddle, Phil Barker on mandolin and vocals, and Nick DiSebastian on bass. I was listening to this album this morning while waking up and having my morning cup of coffee.  At the get go, my foot started stomping with such great songs as St. Augustine, Southern Crescent, House with a Window, Long Time Comin, Arkansas Gambler and much more.

96440,16310,19614,"Just discovered this artist and this album and I'm in love!  I frankly admit that I was originally drawn to her because of the Russian connection, but I stayed for the music.

The overall sound of the album is synthetic, somehow reminiscent of Michael Jackson and Gwen Stefani, and manages to be both ethereal and vigorous at the same time, interspersed with bits of futuristic, space-trip noise, along with snippets of conversation in English and Russian.  While it's easy to pick out influences and similarities with other artists, especially from the 80s and early 90s, the music is nonetheless fresh, unique, and catchy enough to keep on repeat.  Thematically, the lyrics range from seemingly standard relationship fare (e.g., ""What's It Gonna Be?"", ""Touch""), that still contains plenty of soulful introspection, to contemplations of the nature of reality (e.g., the title track ""Nothing's Real"").  Perhaps the overarching theme is time and the transformation from childhood to adulthood, something that appears both in the songs themselves (e.g., ""Nothing's Real,"" ""Kidz 'n' Stuff,"" ""What Happened to Us?"") and in the crackly bits of conversation that break up the two halves of the album, and  frame it.  The end result is an album that is both catchy girl-pop and something more intellectual and esoteric.",1479859200,5

96537,1738,5959,"George followed up Paul's ""Band on the Run"" with his own Beatles tribute, this song was released shortly after John's murder and is a direct tribute to John as opposed to the whole band. Touchingly, Paul and Ringo play on this song, the first time all three performed together after the Beatles breakup (and only time aside from the Free as a Bird and Real Love singles released for their Anthology 1 and 2 albums in 1995/1996. This song is upbeat, it sort of reminds me of Crackerbox Palace which was another single a few years earlier. George never had the quantity of songs that Paul and John did, but quality wise, he had some pretty great songs, and this is definitely one of them.",1479945600,5

96543,5777,16615,"Classic Beatles song with an opening feedback to it that is memorable. The story goes John one day in the recording studio had his guitar too close to the amplifier that produced the feedback sound. The four lads basically went ""whoa"" that sounded neat, can we recreate that in a song. And The Beatles being The Beatles recreated that sound for the opening to ""I Feel Find"".

There's more to this song however then the opening. Great beat and sound. John sings lead in fine voice with nice back up harmonizing by Paul and George. For anyone who is both a Beatles fan and looking to download some of their songs onto your MP3 player this is a must to include.",1479945600,5

That very rarely works, especially in R&B when artists like Maze or the great Whitney Houston whom did it very well, because they showed colors can be blossom in R&B. But in pop, that doesn't work so easily. When I first heard Halsey, it really didn't seem like it was anything special. Then, I went back to her music, after I heard one of her songs, which was sampled by Coldplay and Beyonce' for Hymn For The Weekend. Halsey's New Americana was the song they sampled, and listening to it, it was very dark but took a very tough stance on how the younger Americans have not been recognized for the past several years, and with people like Donald Trump whom made them look like there voices never existed. It isn't a bad song, but yet there are other ones that sounded much better taking a stance with he next generations in society around.

96685,12301,16442,"This is a rather difficult review to write, first because Im rather fond of Gaslight Anthem, and secondly because I dearly want to be inspired to like this solo project from Brian Fallon.

If theres one characteristic that Fallon carries around with him and refuses to let go of, its his penchant for spending too much time looking in his rearview mirror, over his shoulder, and his downright desire to be anyone other than who he actually is.  As to the rearview mirror aspect, if one listens to the mans lyrics on both the Gaslight Anthem albums and this solo outing, Brian seems to fear that his past is creeping up on him, and in so doing, that past is eventually going to catch up with him, and at that moment in time, hes going to have to come face to face with the present, the here and now, and his place in it.  When that time comes, Im sincerely hoping that his visions are focused on the future, because essentially there is nothing one can write about that happened a mere two hours in the past, over breakfast, so hes gonna have to face a future, and write about some things hed like to see happen, about dreams he longs to have come true, rather than resurrecting a past for which no one can do anything about.

As to him wishing to be someone else, on The 59 Sound, a song by Gaslight Anthem, he waxes longingly that he wishes he looked like Elvis, and then goes on to allude to Sam Space in Casablanca on the album jacket, while Gaslight has yet another song entitled Steve McQueen.  Of course wed all like to be someone other than ourselves at times  but theres a genuine difference between that, and not coming to grips with the fact that we are who we are.  Of course one could easily point to Springsteen when it comes to either of these aspects, yet Bruce wasn't so much living in the past, its more that he was revealing himself to us, telling us his stories, what made him who he is as he moved into the present.  And yes, one could certainly infer that Springsteens most interesting and beloved albums came from viewing his past.  And while thats all well and good, Bruce accepted those nostalgic characters, those struggling years, owing them, making them his own, while Fallon seems to be trying to out run them, as if by giving them voice, they will turn to dust, no longer being present to torment his mind.

Theres no mistaking that Pain Killers obsessively belongs to Brian Fallon  its chocked full of idyllic images of an America that no longer exists, and probably never existed as Fallon has come to romanticize it; with that romanticization shading both the good and negative aspects of his plagued memories.  Frankly, Fallons become sort of a parody of himself, after all, how many girls named Maria, and how many times can he image a late night diner before actual cracks appear, and folks begin to think that they're hearing their the same old songs through a new set of speakers.

I so wish that Brian Fallon would grasp the idea that even the losers get lucky some times [to paraphrase Tom Petty], because I actually like hearing the man sing, investing myself in his visions, and listening to his narratives.  Each song from Pain Killers feels as if the man is standing outside of not so much himself, but of real life, giving me the sensation that even as Fallon is holding faded photographic images, those images are bleaching in the sun, leaving him with only impressions of not only those images, but of his memory, where nothing can be trusted as truth.

With all that being said, Pain Killers is the sort of thing that draws me in, like a cheap pulp novel you read and leave on the seat of the crosstown bus when you're finished.  Nothing here is a keeper, but what Fallon does do is linger in my mind, where his memories mesh with mine, where I feel not so much alone knowing that Brian Fallon is out there reminding me that perhaps in this day and age, the past is not such a bad place to stake a claim.

96695,16167,5970,"This takes me back to late 1961. I think this was the first of a string of hits for this gifted singer. Then, of course, I got to see the movie of the same title. That is a different story which does not belong here. I wore out the single, what can I say. The MP3 sound is amazingly good. It is actually better than my old single vinyl which got so scratched that I had to replace it.",1480204800,5

Well, I can't tell what kind of lyrics are used until I buy it, which sucked. I just ended up buying it and not using it, because it is a different version than my child needs for her choir practice. I would've been fine with the start of the music if it at least had the standard classical lyrics. No, the singer modified the lyrics and it isn't the standard one. I feel really frustrated. This is the third Jingle Bell I had to buy to verify. I wish lyrics are there for item description.",1480291200,2

I liked her arrangements of Leonard Cohen's songs very much. Refreshing and different.  Probably my favorite version of ""Everybody Knows"" -- it's so very well done. I also thought ""The Train"" was very good.

96783,1484,13920,"Wow. Where did this band come from and why has it taken me so long to find them? This group is heavily influenced by all the bands I love, in particular AC/DC, and combine it all in a hard rockin way that makes them sound like Jackyl, Kid Rock, Theory of a Deadman, AC/DC and Aerosmith combined to form some sort of super band!

It's not often I love an album from start to finish, and this one ALMOST was that, but with the exception of a couple of songs, i'd still praise this as the best album i've heard all year.

I still have no idea who these guys are, but i'm now a fan for life and instantly adding ""Hey Ho"", ""Strip Tease"" and ""Put the record on"" to all time favorite songs.

If you like AC/DC, Aerosmith, Thoery of A Deadman, Led Zep, Sabbath, Alice Coooper, Tesla and similar bands then check these guys out. They are a bit heavier in sound, and don't really go for classic guitar riffs as such, but you outta get a kick out of these guys.",1480377600,4

The melodies are comfortable, friendly & genuinewhile radiating a sort of joy-tinged rock n roll melancholy that just makes you want to be a part of the experience.  Its like the boys down at the bar had a few drinks, read some existential poems and picked up their guitars to howl at the moon with a purpose.  The sound comes off as something like a mix of Wilco, The Black Keys and Foxygen.  The Psychedelic Swamp, most of which was originally written back in 2001, mixes compelling Americana pop with a quirky psychedelic melody twist to get a retro-roots rock album that feels like home.",1480377600,4

Ragtime is not what I had seen it as and I had no idea that it could be played with such exquisite sensitivity.

The music is at times soothing, at times boisterous, I could even dance or march to some of it - some of the most life affirming music that I have ever heard. It will definitely lift your spirits and enhance even wonderful moments.

The ragtime is interspersed with more classical pieces, such as several by Louis Moreau Gottschalk, the result being a marvelous interplay of moods from one piece to another. BTW, this collection contains 111 (one hundred eleven) pieces!

Which is why it is not surprising that this song was covered by the great Stevie Nicks in the 90's. Truthfully, the entire Greatest Hits album this song is featured on is worth purchasing, but if you're low on funds or new to Tom Petty's music and want to discover what The Heartbreakers are all about, purchasing this song is definitely a good way to go.

96987,16941,6640,"This album is a perfect example of a band who takes its musical cues from existing artists, jumbles them up and tries to present itself as fresh and new and, heaven forbid, ORIGINAL.  Young the Giant doesn't have an original bone in their bodies (no pun intended).  Do you really know why the song ""Cough Syrup"" is so catchy and ear-wormy?  It's because its first verse shares the exact same melody as the verse to Scottish new-wavers Altered States' ""I Could Be Happy"" from (gasp) 1982!!!  If you don't believe me, check it out by listening to the sample before buying.  In fact, most of the song ""Cough Syrup"" is a mashup of ""Happy"" crossed with about 90% of the Cocteau Twins entire oeuvre.  I'm still waiting for YTG to perform it on some music awards show and bring out ""Super-Special guest"" Liz Fraser after the first verse and chorus.  Then Ms. Fraser would warble the second verse in her inimitable, almost incomprehensible, style and the audience would go nuts.  But that would never happen in a million because that would show YTG to be the sham they are.  And that second airplay hit, ""My Body"" sounds like a cross between the Smiths (or at least Morrissey's solo stuff) and the band James (""Laid""/""Sit Down"").  If you like those two song, download them singularly.  Don't waste $$ on the whole album, it's all too derivative and done before.",1480636800,2

Foster and Chris Pine.  Unfortunately, this song was NOT on the soundtrack, so I had to order it solo. This song (as nearly all the songs on the soundtrack) was placed appropriately at a key scene and fit right into the storyline.  It is a haunting song, especially if you hear it in conjunction with the movie. The song has a simple guitar accompaniment for background and Gillian's voice resonates the mood of the title.

Which is why it is not surprising that this song was covered by the great Stevie Nicks in the 90's. Truthfully, the entire Greatest Hits album this song is featured on is worth purchasing, but if you're low on funds or new to Tom Petty's music and want to discover what The Heartbreakers are all about, purchasing this song is definitely a good way to go.

Yes, traditional Christmas Carols can be reinterpreted and this is a case in point, but too often for me the songs just don't take off as those on their Worship albums do.

97077,16310,19650,"I just discovered this album (thanks, iTunes recommendations!) and I was simply blown away by it on first listen.  Haunting instrumentals are topped by Irglovas soaring voice, which brings the religious and spiritual themes of the songs to life, giving the impression (if I may be forgiven the fancifulness) of an angel come to earth, or a fairy visiting the mortal realm.

Given the combination of female vocalist and non-synthetic, almost classical musical background, the comparisons with Tori Amos are inevitable, and as a huge Amos fan I can say that the similarities are certainly there, and Amos fans owe it to themselves to check this artist out.  And yet Irglova is no mere Amos knock-off, but a powerful singer and songwriter in her own right, with a distinctive sound all her own.  In particular, her European backgroundIrglova is Czech, currently residing in Icelandcan be heard in the echoes and resonances of European-style folk and church music, as well as hints of Gypsy and Middle Eastern outpourings, as opposed to Amoss bluesy Carolina roots.  The total effect is something that will appeal to lovers of the Amos strain in modern popular music, but that stands out as unique.

Thematically, the album cycles through creation and re-creation, starting with the church bells of the opening track, Point of Creation, which starts us on our journey through birth and rebirth.  We set off on a journey in the gorgeously evocative track The Leading Bird, searching for signs in Fortune Teller, with its Middle Eastern ululations, and Without a Map, before experiencing rebirth in Mary, Phoenix, and Seasons Change, another stand-out track.  The album ends with This Right Here, bringing us back, thematically, to our original point of creation.

In sum, if you're looking for pounding bass and synthetic scratchiness, you're going to be disappointed in this album, but music aficionados hoping to go on a spiritual journey that combines old-world sensibilities and an other-worldly sound should put this album on their playlist without delay.",1480636800,5

My favorites on this album are the ones that I don't mind hearing regularly and that I don't skip. They are: The Burrito Song, The 10 Second Rule Song, 5 Nights at Freddy's, Brainfreeze Song, The Secret Life of a Hamster, Cats 9 Lives, Instagram Song, and the First Comment Song. Most of these have catchy music to support them, and I'm partial to those that highlight Rhett's singing ability.  R&L lyrics in general are usually both smart and goofy, because they're pretty intellectual and well educated, and don't take themselves too seriously. I generally don't like this type of comedical music at all (I despised Weird Al in the 90s and never really enjoyed Flight of the Conchords) but these guys are somehow different. More 'real' I suppose.",1480723200,5

97139,16167,10407,"That was during the 'Psychedelic' era in 1967. This was Grace Slick at her best, I think. This track is a live recording. It is good, but a little too short, I think. I like it better than the studio version which lacks a bit of intensity. I still like it a lot. I must say, however, I was never on the drug scene. I could enjoy music easily without it.",1480723200,5

97213,16524,17789,"A friend turned me on to Kaleo, and I'm glad she did,  Good stuff.  This album covers a lot of sonic territory, which I very much appreciate.  I can't stand albums where all the songs blend together and the whole thing sounds the same from beginning to end.

The opening track ""No Good"" has a great blues rock vibe that really kicks the album off nicely.  ""Way down"" continues the blues vibe, but with a much slower, pulsing groove.  ""Broken Bones"" has a nice throwback sound.  ""Glass House"" picks things back up with more of a faster tempo.  ""All The Pretty Girls"" sounds like something you'd here from Passenger or Coldplay... a very different sound, though still a very good one.  ""Vor  Vaglaskgi""... well, what can I say?  It's a beautiful, haunting song.  I have no idea what the lyrics are in English, but it's sound wonderful.

In all, this is a fantastic album.  The lyrics and song craft are well done and the songs are diverse.  Buy it.  You won't regret it.",1480809600,5

CDs and streaming music is just not as special an experience of pulling out the beautiful purple translucent vinyl disks and playing them one side at a time. I've had LPs since I bought my first Beatles album in 1964 and still have thousands of them. However I only buy 20-30 LPs a year. The rest of the time CDs will do.

97330,8394,18678,"This is an album that grows on you.  If I had rated it the first time I heard it I would probably only have given it 2 or 3 starts.

But playing it and listening to it frequently paid dividends.  Unsurprisingly since Chris Collingwood is prime force here and was the usual lead singer for Fountains of Wayne, this album sounds a lot like FoW, and that is not a bad thing.

But it is a smoother, calmer and less snarky version.  I read somewhere that he wanted to make more mature music and it shows in this album.  You hear more sophisticated tunes, rhythms and themes than in Fountains of Wayne, including some light Bossa Nova sounds and less electric guitar.

So if you've grown softer, as many of us have as we've gotten older, you may find yourself ready for this album.  If you haven't and you're looking for something similar to FoW let me recommend that you try Snmnmnmn.  The lead singer even sounds a lot, with Asbestos Weekend being probably their stongest effort.

But don't let that distract you from this Look Park effort.  It is worth the time it takes to grow into it.",1480982400,4

97651,56,1195,"Hard to believe that it has been 20 years since Toni Braxton came out with her landmark album, Secrets. The songs really have defined here as a definitive diva in the ranks of legends like Whitney Houston, Aretha Franklin and the great Natalie Cole. Every song from Secrets really remains seductive, beautiful from the essence of the soul of the songstress itself. When I think of Secrets, I really think of every song because it defined her more than her debut record did in 1993. One of my favorite songs that still ignites from Secrets, You're Makin' Me High, still ignites as a sensual essenced song that will really want to make you get your groove on with the one that you love. The song still 20 years after it came out, is strong as other sensual songs like Marvin Gaye's Let's Get It On and Chris Isaak's Wicked Game. It is one of my favorite seductive songs that really is worth the money, and if you have never heard a Toni Braxton song, well this is one the top tracks I absolutely recommend overall.

Luckily, there are some serious ears and minds out there, and this time it seems they gave their respected opinion above. I took the chance of buying and do not regret it. Thus, I second the exuberance of those comments.
While I resist to say that any recording of a Mahler symphony is ""perfect"" (such great music preclude me from stating it) this recording is just about the best 10th out there. The stars of conducting, playing and recording were aligned. Extraordinary.
Someone said this recording came 'from left field'. It seems so indeed.

His groovy side slides thru and his softer side shines just as bright and his voice carries the entire disc with the strength of an artist who has been in the game longer than he actually has been.

Several selections were ones I've never heard before which was a holiday gift in itself!

The Drifters, Ella Fitzgerald, The Jackson 5, Brenda Lee and other original artists offer upbeat favorites for your holiday gathering or a trip in a sleigh. Kinda jazzier with the likes of Tony Bennett's rendition of ""Silver Bells"" and a bit soulful with ""Merry Christmas Baby"" by Otis Redding, both of which I liked very much.

Overall, I like this swift moving holiday playlist, but I wasn't as happy with some of the funkier selections like ""Who's Up There?"" by Bhi Bhiman.  It's a personal preference thing, and some listeners may really love how it freshens up the playlist for them.  But it's the reason I give it 4 stars (I Like It) versus 5 stars (I Love It).

As for it being 'dinner party' music... not so much for me.  A buffet maybe?  As this playlist has some 'move' to it.  Like with Earth, Wind & Fire's ""Sleigh Ride"" which has more than a little giddy-up and go!",1481328000,4

The main theme recurrent throughout most of the tracks was very similar to the main theme that Masashi Hamauzu used for his Final Fantasy XIII soundtrack.  Although somewhat beautiful, the Ori theme so heavily recalled Hamauzu's earlier work that I was unable to enjoy it.  The tracks seemed like remixes of FF13's ""The Promise"" and ""Serah's Theme,"" and it was impossible to dissociate one from the other.

If Gareth did this by accident, having never been aware of Hamauzu's work, what a dreadful happenstance!  I hope such a mistake never happens to him again--no doubt many composers worry that they might inadvertently seem to be plagiarizing, when they really were not doing so.",1481414400,2

98079,7258,18838,"My first few listens of this disc deceived me and I thought it was good but not great. Over time and repeated listens I have changed my mind as this has grown on me quite a bit. No doubt about it, Polyphinas prowess on their instruments shows these are talented musicians at play. Musically, they incorporate melody on a recurring basis so this is a rare instrumental outing that the tunes actually stick in your head and are hummable. The lineup includes two guitars, bass and drums. Similar in style to others in the genre they don't seem to be breaking any new ground but what they offer is solid. The only negatives are a lot of the songs sound the same. Also, many of the tunes end abruptly and feels like not much thought was put into how to end the song. It leaves me frustrated to end a song with mediocre flare when you could end with a bang. As for the mix, well if you like the current trend of harsh metallic tinny sounding loud mixes you will enjoy this.  So overall, this is a tremendous album of superb young musicians playing catchy instrumental music with room for improvement and I look forward to future releases.",1481500800,4

I looked at the track list and titles like ""Show Me A God"", ""Demons"", ""Shadows On the Road"", ""Blacken the Sun"" and ""Killing You"" really got me intrigued. I bought it.

98260,16941,19731,"This may be the original band from the 80s (or at least most of the original members) but this is not a re-issue of their original EP which I reviewed under its own listing.  While the title track sounds almost identical to the original album edit, I'm suspecting it may be a re-recording as the play times are off (the vinyl lists the time at 4:19,  and while not printed on the credits, iTunes or Windows Media Player shows a runtime of 4:06 - this may also be a remastering artifact - I've noticed on many other releases slight discrepancies between the listed vinyl playtime and the actual playtime when the song is on CD).  The other songs are all NEW, and written in the same style as the original EP.  What would make this an ideal CD would have been to get the licensing for the original self-titled EP and any B-sides or other unreleased tracks from that era and combine them on to one CD (with an average song length of 3:30 minutes, I'm sure they'd fit!).  Still for fans of the original EP, this is the closest thing to ""Monroes
Heaven""",1481673600,4

98521,1760,8112,"Bob Dylan is the artist that some people love to hate and other people love to love.  He is arguably the most important cultural figure of the 20th century, or at least the last half of it, single-handedly changing everything about popular music from the length of songs to their subject matter to the way they are sung, yet some refuse to give him credit for any of these things or for the many great songs and albums he's created, dismissively complaining ""he can't sing!"" and leaving it at that.  There are also those who will defend him to the death after a lousy concert performance (and there have been many, especially since around 2010 or so) or an ill-conceived idea like the recent ""Sinatra"" albums or his odd behavior on his final ""The Late Show with David Letterman"" performance.  Even Dylan himself in his 2012 ""Rolling Stone"" interview lamented, ""Why is it that when people talk about me they have to go crazy?""

I try to be more rational in my discussions of Dylan and have felt the wrath of Dylan fans and haters alike on various internet forums.  As I write this, there are 458 reviews of Christmas in the Heart posted by others, and the only reason I think that mine is necessary is just to give a little different take on why I like it.

I do like this album.  It has a nice old-timey feel to it.  I like the traditional arrangements and the production, the latter an area where Dylan hasn't been given enough credit since he started producing his own albums, beginning with ""Love and Theft,"" under the nom de plume Jack Frost.  Those who complain about Dylan's singing on this one miss the point.  Christmas songs are like folk songs - they're for EVERYBODY to sing, not just the sweet-voiced among us.  The Earth is 4.5 billion years old, but how old is the phonograph?  Or the radio?  How long have these things been commonplace in homes?  It's maybe only the last 80-90 years or so that we've been paying professionals to do our singing for us.  Previously, if you wanted to hear a song, you sung it yourself, or your family sat around singing it.  That's how the tradition of folk song, in which Dylan is grounded, started - and of course, families and friends gathered to sing Christmas carols as well.

So if Dylan's voice isn't so great on this album (and it's not), that's OK with me, as he's just carrying on a folk tradition that says anybody can sing these songs.  If, for your tastes, he sounds too much like your great uncle after one too many egg nogs, that's fine, as there are plenty of good Christmas albums by the likes of Bing Crosby, Tony Bennett, and Peggy Lee to recommend.  I for one miss my great uncles.",1481932800,4

98576,11034,8893,"This album is an absolute classic from front to back. The first time I heard Husker Du was with Warehouse, and I wasn't intrigued so I didn't listen to the CD again for quite some time. Then out of nowhere I was doing my Amazon vinyl shopping (usually while intoxicated which is never good for the wallet..) and I searched Husker Du out of nowhere and found this album at a good price. Bought it and listened to it immediately upon receiving it in the mail. I was blown away from the second I heard a noise out of my speakers. Loud, noisy, screaming guitar. Fast drums, bass beat to back the drums just enough and lyrics I couldn't understand but eventually caught them ""new day rising"" absolutely simple, yet very effective with the yelling and such. I was so hooked already. It's one of those 40+ minute albums that feels like it goes by in seconds. So I just flipped back to side A and did the repeat. The next day after listening to this I got in my truck headed to work and put in Warehouse because it was the only CD I had by them and as opposed to my first time, now I was in love with what I was hearing again. Since then I'm now a Husker Du fiend. These three guys are amazing. New Day Rising is just gorgeous though because it was the start of their more ""friendly"" and ""pop-ish"" music, but it's still so upfront and intense at the same time. Really groundbreaking stuff. This and Zen Arcade are at a tie for my favorite with Warehouse not far behind. Every album they touched though is just magical. Great group of musicians and such entertaining and fun music to listen to no matter what time. Highly recommended album and group.",1481932800,5

So why did this grow on me, and why do I feel like it's one of her more solid albums? Maybe the theme helps. Very much dig the songs about Capote, Hemingway, etc. But there's just something about this album that every song is great. Even for someone who doesn't like the jazzy sounding songs.",1482105600,5

98696,9,290,"Frozen made this song an instant classic.

Elsa's story is one so many can relate to and very heart touching.  Her parents couldn't understand what she was.  They were unable to help her control it.  So instead they taught her to physically cover it up, mentally conceal it and to feel nothing but fear of herself.

Eventually that forced Elsa to retreat into world entirely of her own creation - to a kingdom of Isolation..  All she wanted was to be alone and free.

All that is summed up in the song ""Let if Go""",1482105600,5

98835,2905,17642,"This is a very strong album. The musicianship and sound is stellar. The writing, as a whole album, is just short of classic Paul Simon. In fact, if this was a lesser artist, I probably would have said this is a 5-star effort. It's just this is the writer of ""Bridge Over Troubled Waters"" and ""Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes,"" just to name two classic songs. There is a wonderful slyness to several of these songs that I don't remember in earlier work; for example, the way ""Wristband"" becomes a sideways commentary on income equality. At this point, my favorite is the first song ""The Werewolf,"" because of the soundscape as well as the lyrics. Paul Simon continues to be one of the most consistent artists in Pop and Rock.",1482192000,4

""Singin' Again"" featuring Canton Jones brings back that R&B jam that we all grew up on.  ""Keep On Moving"" featuring Uncle Reece is a song that gives us a look at Mr. Del's life & where God has taken him encouraging the listener to get back up when you get knocked down.

98980,12282,19782,"Although not nearly as famous as their longer running FIDDLER ON THE ROOF (1964), Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick's THE ROTHSCHILDS (1970) tells a story just as moving as that of FIDDLER, if not more so.  The Broadway of the 1960's saw several composers who were exceptionally talented at conjuring up in their scores other times and places, and few were more skillful in this regard than Jerry Bock.  Whereas Bock's sound in FIDDLER is Eastern European, his sound in THE ROTHSCHILDS is Central Europeon:  namely, the Germany and Austria of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries (there are even hints of...Beethoven?  Mendelssohn?...in the overture!).  This is the music not only of Jewish shetls but of cities and royal courts.  Harnick's lyrics are literate, clever, poignant, and cutting:  just listen to the ambitious ""Everything"" or to the portrayal of underhanded antisemitism in ""They Say.""  It may not be as catchy or memorable as that of FIDDLER, but this is a sophisticated score, perhaps the team's most ""accomplished"" one of all.

The original Broadway cast recording, for the most part, does the score justice.  The warm voice of Hal Linden (as patriarch Mayer Rothschild) never fails to bring tears to my eyes during ""In My Own Lifetime,"" and the actors who play Mayer's sons make a strong ensemble.  Jill Clayburgh does a fine job as Hannah Cohen; Keene Curtis sounds wonderful in several roles.  The weak link, vocally, is the energetic Paul Hecht as Nathan Rothschild; though he has two solos -- ""This Amazing London Town"" and ""I'm in Love!"" -- Hecht really sings little better than the average man in the street.  Had Nathan been better cast I would have given the recording five stars; certainly the brilliant, underrated score deserves to be heard again, in a Broadway revival of THE ROTHSCHILDS.  Though not around in 1970, I would venture to say that the material would seem even more relevant and powerful now than it did then.",1482364800,4

98989,17119,19718,"We've been using this album off of Prime for probably over a year now, and finally I decided to break down and buy it tonight.  Because it pretty much hit me, my life could not function right now without it.  We have a beautiful little boy with some very specialized needs who has had a pretty rough history of sleeping through the night. In the beginning, it was that he needed constant motion.  Then, it was that every little thing woke him up.  Every little thing.  Phone on vibrate going off two rooms down the hall?  Awake.  Cat meowing?  Awake.  Someone tiptoeing outside his door?  Again, awake. Whispering downstairs?  Yep, you guessed it...awake.  And not happy awake.  There was a time when I could pretty much count on getting 2-3 hours of sleep a night, and it was the pits.

We experimented with a lot of different things, but finally found that this album, cranked up to full volume on a kindle in his room, was soothing enough to him that he could sleep through it, but it masked a wide variety of other sounds going on around him.  Sometimes noises still wake him up through this, like the time somebody wrong number texted me in the middle of the night right at the break in between songs, or if my daughter shuts a door too loud, but I can almost always get 5-6 hours of sleep a night now, sometimes even 8. So for these perhaps atypical reasons. I love this album.  Totally *love* this album, because of what it has done for my son's ability to sleep through the night, and therefore, my ability to get any sort of sleep myself. Heck, I'm not even sure I can sleep without hearing it anymore because I'm so used to listening to it through his monitor at night. Love, love, really love this album...",1482364800,5

98994,16162,3723,"I grew up in the 1970s. Many songs being played on the radio brings back memories for me. The songs from the 1960s and 1970s have a certain sound from that era, and lyrics demonstrating social change. I am a science major and not very creative. I have always found it fascinating how artists (painters, sculptors, writers, musicians, ... song writers) are inspired by social change and create their best works. So now that I am older with a fewer more dollars in my pocket, I can buy and enjoy music of my early youth. I really like Neal Young and Steven Stills. I had no idea they were members of Buffalo Springfield. Or are they members of Buffalo Springfield?",1482364800,5

99051,17129,18802,"I'm listening to this right now.  I listened to Sremm Life on Amazon Prime and really like it.  Though I haven't listened to rap in awhile I heard Black Beatles and then after liking Sremm Life 1 I decided to get it.  I really really like it.  I live in Memphis and grew up in West TN so I have always been a Three Six Mafia fan (along with Juicy J, Project Pat, Frayser Boy, etc) and some of the songs take me back to the old Three Six style.  If you are curious just pull up the album and listen to it on YouTube first.  The last few songs kind of trail off but the first and the middle is bumpin'.  I'll be listening to this for awhile!

Being from Tupelo it's obvious they are influenced by Three Six and Memphis rap.  There is a track with Juicy J where they throw a Three Six line in at the end.  Also the Project Pat reference on the first album kind of pulled me in.  I like Rae Sremmurd and will keep supporting them by buying their music.

Evie's voice is absolutely beautiful and the songs are arranged perfectly; going from festive cheer to traditional carols, to very spiritual songs such as Oh Holy Night, performed the way only Evie can do! These songs also appeal to children. This ""album"" then CD and now ""music list"" has been the favorite during the Christmas season in our home decade after decade.

99172,17141,374,"This album was ok to fair.  My favorite country music was from the 60s thru the 90s.  There is some country since 2000 that I like but what passes for country today is nothing more than rock music being sung with a southern twang.  IMO  I'm a fan of Tim McGraw but like his older stuff better.  This album has some nice songs, especially Shotgun Rider and Meanwhile Back At Mama's.",1482537600,3

99325,56,19798,"I am just truly devastated to hear such somber and tragic news, that on December 25th, 2016, George Michael had tragically died at the somber and young age of 53. I am truly crushed that he, once one of the most soulful and talented singers that had ever came out of the 80's would actually pass on at such a sad death from heart failure. He was one of a kind, with any song he had done, soulfully from his sweet voice, and true essence from every song he had performed on his own, and when he was a part of Wham! One of my all-time favorite songs of George's was when he teamed up with Elton John on Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me in 1991. The song still reminds of a sweet collaboration that really hit the souls eyes, with so much in the way of loss from AIDS like when Freddie Mercury of Queen died that year. George was amazing at any song he had done from past and present, and every song he made was met with beauty and blessings from any he wrote, and others he covered on his own. It is just tragic that today, the world let the sun go down on him, but George Michael's legacy will be forever from the sweet and dear eyes of a truly blue-eyed soul.

George Michael:  1963 - 2016  May he and his mom dance with the sun again!!!

99336,12631,6601,"In the mid-1960's Wally Bryson (vocals, guitar), David Smalley (guitar), James Skeen (bass) and Jim Bonfanti (drums) formed the garage-rock band known as The Choir in a suburb of Cleveland, OH. Originally called The Mods, their largest commercial success came with the release of their first single ""It's Cold Outside"" in December 1966.  Although the tune stalled at #68 on the Billboard Hot 100 Singles chart the record got a significant amount of airplay in a number of major cities across America.  Many consider ""It's Cold Outside"" to be a classic of the garage-band era.  Just a few years later in 1970, Bryson, Smalley and Bonfonti went on to form the pop-rock group The Raspberries with Eric Carmen.  The Raspberries would go on to have number of hit singles during the early part of the 1970's.  This is the original recording first released on the Canadian-American label in the spring of 1967.",1482710400,4

To be honest I don't even recognize the names of some of the other singers or groups with tracks on this CD so make sure to do your homework, which I didn't, before you plop down the money.  Even the 3 songs by Zac Brown were nothing to write home about.  A compilation album that should never have been put together in my opinion.  I've already given my copy to Good Will.

This song has been sung by many performers over the years, and the interpretation is sometimes over-the-top, or it feels like the singer is too eager-to-impress. In our view, Jones delivers a humble, natural version of this.",1482796800,5
99455,17172,5904,"A very fine rendition of this song. What makes it special are the varying dynamics, both from this wonderful singer's voice and his subtle delivery on his guitar. This interpretation is sensitive, poignant, and highly recommended.

Generally, these ""deluxe"" editions of the albums include several alternate takes of the songs.  In this case, there must not have been very many alternate takes available, because there are only FOUR alternate takes of the movie songs included, although they did include a few alternate takes of the ""bonus songs"" that were not recorded for the movie from the original album.  The bulk of the material is THREE different mixes of the movie songs.  You get the original stereo album.  You get the original mono album, which by the way is one of the rarest Elvis albums, since they stopped making mono albums soon after it came out.  And you get the ""remixed soundtrack masters"", which feature the engineer announcing the take number before the songs and some of the songs go longer instead of fading out like on the original mixes.

I found out about this great album when i was flipping pages through an old Rock 'encyclopedia'. It says that this was possibly the best live rock record of all times. That encyclopedia was published in 1977. So maybe there are other good live documents recorded after this one. But since (at least for me) rock 'died' around 1980 i don't think so. Probably only the Who's Live at Leeds, The Stones Get yer Ya Yas concert, Zappa's Roxy & Elsewhere and Hendrix Band of Gypsys are some of the few contenders capable of competing with this jewel. If you are serious about rock n roll and your neck hair raises when hearing Ray Charles, Otis Redding, Sam Cooke, etc. then you DEFINITELY need this album.",1482883200,5

99576,6684,12421,"""Badlands"" by Halsey is what you call a ""spur of the moment"" purchase. I didn't know much about Halsey (besides the song, ""Ghost) but I'm extremely impressed with this astonishing album. Her music is electro-pop. I love that genre of music but it's a tricky genre to make just right, cohesively. Sometimes electro-pop can come off manufactured, flat, or too glossy. ""Badlands"" is the perfect balance of dark, gutsy, and haunting pop, but it's still catchy, playful, and fresh. I got this album at Target. I think the Target version is worth it if you're looking for more tracks. My version has 16 tracks instead of 11. More bang for your buck! There's 5 essential tracks that I can't get enough of: ""Castle"", ""Hurricane"", ""Colors"", ""Haunting"", and ""Control"". Halsey's voice is really pretty (very melodic). I like that she doesn't scream the songs. She's easy to understand. She doesn't sing like she has marbles in her mouth. There's really not one bad song in the bunch. ""Hold Me Down"", ""New Americana"", ""Young God"", ""Coming Down"", and ""Roman Holiday"" are absolutely stellar. I love ""Drive"". It's very laid-back but emotional. ""Colors Pt. II"" is a short remix but it's lovely. ""Ghost"" was the track that made me a Halsey fan. ""Gasoline"" and ""Strange Love"" are incredibly hypnotic. There's an awesome cover of Johnny Cash's, ""I Walk the Line"". I love Halsey's interpretation. The track is stripped down (love the piano) and so romantic. ""Badlands"" is worth it just for ""Hurricane"". I could listen to that song all day. Musically, this is the best electro-pop album I've ever heard. You can tell Halsey and the producers worked really hard to make this record sound flawless and meaningful. The hooks, melodies, lyrics, and arrangements are remarkable. She's such an underrated artist. I hope she makes another album soon. This is good music. Enjoy!",1482883200,5

99597,6534,15309,"I got this CD because I pretty much buy anything that Julianna Hatfield puts out.  I have loved her voice, lyrics, and musicianship since the Blake Babies..  I was two songs into the CD before I realized she was collaborating with Paul Westerburg of the Replacements.  At that point, my mind was blown.  What an amazing collaboration.

There are four immediate standouts on the CD: Wear Me Out Loud, Outta My System, Done Done Done, and King of America.  These are the types of songs that you would throw on a mix tape for someone, and they would think you had the coolest taste in music ever.

My favorite track is the album closer: Hands Together.  The first time through, I didn't comprehend any lyrics - I was just mesmerized by the driving hypnotic rhythm, primarily the guitar arpeggios.  The occasional guitar flourishes over an unwavering drum beat were perfectly placed, and Westerberg could have been reading help wanted ads from a newspaper and it would have sounded amazing.  With repeated listens, I realized the lyrics were pretty incredible too.  If this song had been condensed down to three or four minutes (instead of seven), I know it would have been an indie rock in the vein of Guster, Dawes, or Felice Brothers.  Actually, probably a bigger hit because of the talent involved here.

Obviously, I have no way of knowing what the duo was thinking when they released this album.  I doubt they were trying to push Beyonce out of the Top 40 charts.  I don't think it was a plan to get someone to sign The I Don't Cares to a multi-album record deal.  For one thing, nothing about this album says ""sell out"".  The result is stuff that is pretty weird and will likely alienate a large chunk of the population. (The song 1/2 2 P is an example of this.)  While other songs are so honest and unabashed that you can't help but love them.

Buying this album is a no-brainer for Hatfield or Westerberg fans.  It's also a great choice for alt rock fans looking for something vaguely familiar but completely new.",1482883200,5

Despite all of his success as a country artist Don Williams could never seem to come up with the crossover hit that most country artists were always looking for.  Then in 1980 he recorded a ballad written by Roger Cook and Sam Hogin.  Don finally had his crossover hit.  ""I Believe In You"" spent an impressive 20 weeks on Billboard's Hit 100 pop charts peaking at #24 in November of that year.

99616,8327,14743,"By the time California's STONEGROUND released the 2LP-set ""Family Album"" before Christmas of 1971 - their 2nd platter for Warner Brothers in a year  the San Francisco ensemble were a sprawling ten-piece Rock act fronted by ex Beau Brummels singer and guitarist Sal Valentino and featured no less than four other singers - all ladies (see list below).

Their self-titled debut ""Stoneground"" had arrived in April 1971 on Warner Brothers WS 1895 to acclaim but poor sales and their ambitious but again ignored three-sides-live-one-side-studio ""Family Album"" 2LP set came in December 1971 (Warner Brothers 2ZS 1956). These albums were in turn followed by ""Stoneground 3"" on Warner Brothers BS 2645 in December 1972 - yet none bothered the US charts in any real way despite the favourable reviews, great live rep and big-label name (members of the band would morph into the yacht rock act Pablo Cruise and enjoy six charted albums - one of which ""Worlds Apart"" went Top 6 in 1978).

But on hearing this sprawling and at times brilliant double album from that halcyon year - you're left wondering - why? Maybe we missed something back there? I think we did and reissue label 'Beat Goes On' of England seems to think so too. Theres a lot to love on this gorgeous-sounding 2CD reissue of this long-forgotten band and their gatefold shot at fame  there really is. Here are the rocky details...

UK released November 2016 - ""Family Album"" by STONEGROUND on Beat Goes On BGOCD 1263 (Barcode 5017261212634) is a 2CD Reissue of the 2LP set from 1971 (no bonus tracks) and plays out as follows:

2. Passion Flower
3. Corrina
4. Big River
5. Won't Be Long [Side 2]

Sal Valentino sings Lead Vocals on ""Get Rhythm"", ""Big River"" (both Johnny Cash cover versions) and ""Queen Sweet Dreams"" (his own song) and duets with Lynne Hughes on the Traditional ""Corrina"". Lynne Hughes sings Lead Vocals on ""Passion Flower"" (her own song) and ""Richland Woman"" (a Mississippi John Hurt cover) - Annie Simpson sings Lead Vocals on the spiritual ""Precious Lord"".

BGO's now generic card slipcase adds the 2016 2CD reissue a classy look and JOHN O'REGAN's 12-page liner notes give a potted and affectionate history of the band's many line-up changes explaining their lack of commercial success. The original double vinyl LP was a gatefold sleeve laid out (not surprisingly) in a 'family album' way with pictures of all 10 players on the inner gatefold - that spread is reproduced on the inner two page spread. I still can't definitively say who sings lead on which track (the original never said) and O'Regan doesn't illuminate either. But I can say that audio-wise this is a gorgeous-sounding recording - a beautiful 'high definition' audiophile transfer from original masters that really gives the recordings an ethereal, loose and casually cool feel.

Stoneground's sound isn't easy to nail - probably a good reason as to why they were difficult to market. Best approximation when Valentino is singing is Little Feat live with Leon Russell at the microphone - a combo most Seventies Rock fans would gladly embrace. They also had a knack of making very obvious 'cover versions' their own - and this is evident in their very Stoneground takes on Johnny Cash's ""Get Rhythm"" and their boogie organ-driven version of Dylan's ""If You Gotta Go"" turned into a Soul raver with one of the ladies getting all Tina Turner on its funky ass.

Reviewers complained at the time that the clearly sparse 200 audience members seemed just a little too vocal in their appreciation of the group giving some of the live cuts a false feel  but Id say that this happens so little  its an utterly mute point. The real problem is a lack of killer hits  the songs are good and at times the rhythms funky and inspired  but theres no Top 10 hit on here. Even when they're tackling the Jerry Williams song Total Destruction Of Your Mind which they funk up into a sort of Geno Washington and The Ram Jam Band rave up complete with drum solo  or have a go at Dusty Springfields Wont Be Long turning it into an Aretha Franklin Atlantic Records bopper  they sound like a great covers band  its good but not distinctive enough to make their own mark.

The lonesome slide guitar and lone voice of ""Precious Lord"" is chillingly brilliant though  sparse - like Ry Cooder sat on a chair with Doris Troy letting rip on a microphone nearby  her eyes closed  feeling every righteous word. Of the studio stuff Ron Nagle's ""You Must Be One Of Us"" has Sal Valentino sounding like the recently passed Leon Russell finding his inner Delta Lady. Keyboardist Cary Lerios supplied the mushy love song ""All My Life"" while Lynne Hughes gives us the better ""Where Will I Find Love""  a very Delaney and Bonnie Soul-Rock funky dancer. There's amazing audio on the I-feel-good rocker ""Gonna Have A Good Time and near six-minute instrumental ""Jam It"" chugs along like The Allman Brothers having a Rock-Funk workout in the studio in-between ""Brothers And Sisters"" outtakes.

Piano player Pete Sears who played on their debut would later feature in Hot Tuna and Jefferson Starship and along with Ian McLagan became a member of the house band that played on Rod Stewart's mighty trio of classic albums - ""Gasoline Alley"", ""Every Picture Tells A Story"" and ""Never A Dull Moment"". Cory Lerios, Steve Price and David Jenkins would form Pablo Cruise and sign to A&M Records for major chart success in the Seventies. Stoneground went on make more albums that no one remembers - even returning to Warner Brothers in 1978 for the ""Hearts Of Stone"" LP in 1978. There's a website to the band that tells you bugger all info about them...

To sum up - there's much to dig here and as I listen to the announcer tell the audience to 'give it up' for his children in Stoneground (his words title this review) - I'm thinking he was onto to something with the ignored double ""Family Album"".

Fans of 1971 need to check this superb-sounding 2CD reissue out. And well done to BGO for doing such a top quality job...",1482969600,4

99657,14212,18808,"Sworn Virgins by Omar Rodriguez-Lopez (2016)

Sworn Virgins is the first of twelve albums Omar will be releasing in 2016. It is his 27th solo album (with several more to come). On July 7th, 2016, it was announced that Sworn Virgins would be the first of 12 records Ipecac Records would be releasing throughout the remainder of 2016. Each record will be digitally released on a bi-weekly basis, with a limited CD pressing as well. Upon completion of the release schedule, a limited edition CD/LP box set containing all 12 records will be made available.

With Sworn Virgins Omar ventures back to familiar territory yet continues to experiment with sounds and styles not so common in his catalog. The opening number Pineapple Face is noticeably harder than others in his long catalog of music while Not Even Toad Loves You continues in the same vein sounding much like The Mars Volta in their Frances The Mute era. To Kill A Chi Chi starts out with jangling guitar and a propulsive bass sounding a lot like late seventies Siouxise and the Banshees until they work into the vocals and we find a modern Omar vocally expressing himself through feedback and noise. Trick Harpoon Stare of Baby features a great rhythmic beat, The Cure type guitar and at times a post punk styled vocal. High Water Hell takes us for a u-turn and sends us into a land of lo-fi with vocals youd expect to hear from his other band Bosnian Rainbows. The song combines elements of feedback and noise. Saturine is similar to his 2013 works you might expect to hear this song on Unicorn Skeleton Mask or Equinox. Crows Feet is an album standout with David Gilmour type lead guitar work and samples John Lennon's ""How Do You Sleep."" Heart Mistakes begins with a little seventies punk rock rhythm and works into the typical ORL sound of chaos meets the day in the life of a genius musician. Logged Into Bliss turns the album around with a great 80s appeal with Adrian Belew styled guitar and well choreographed drums that make one think of Stewart Copeland from The Police. All met with ORLs shadowy vocals. Fortuna mellows things down to a dark Joy Division mood as the album closes with the dark and demented Twice A Plague.

Much of the album has a late 70s early 80s post punk appeal that fits Omar quite well. The album capitalizes on Omars excellence with the synthesizer turning otherwise ordinary sounds into a cyclopean sound of thunder. None of the material is newly recorded; the whole project represents the culmination of years of recording, a sort of treasure trove of unreleased material meant to be dived into and absorbed. Chaos is sort of the trademark of Rodriguez-Lopezs work, and its a form in which hes comfortable existing. Sworn Virgins finds him stretching his legs as far as he ever has, magically building a cohesive soundscape from the void of sonic anarchy. Its a record built on seemingly disparate layers of sound that meld together in bizarre ways to form a uniquely ORL experience.

Built on digital loops and propelled by a restrained guitar, Sworn Virgins is almost meditative, lulling you in sweetly before careening you on a journey through the chaos of his creative id. Like the artist that created it, the album is at all points and in all ways convention defying. As soon as you're accustomed to the repetitious nature of the digitized soundscape, Omar switches things up, jarring you from complacency with a stark reminder that the unexpected is all thats to be expected. Were in his house now, for a party thats set to last from now until the end of the year. Strap in tight, because if Sworn Virgins is any indication, its going to be a wild ride from here on.",1482969600,5

99674,7782,9719,"If any song could be a ""signature"" song for Al Hirt it's Java, originally released on his great ""Honey In the Horn"" album in the early 60's. The song by his old New Orleans friend Alan Toussaint  shows off his distinctive sound and style.

In the early 90's I got to meet Al Hirt briefly at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival. He was part of an interview series. His interview was unusual as he aired his feelings about the IRS and business deals gone bad between his reminisces of career and thoughts on Jazz. There was a lot more to him than just music.

When he recorded ""Honey in the Horn"" (his his most classic album) he was at the peak of his form. My parents played it on our old Blaupunkt stereo console that was as big as a steamer trunk. It is a classic indeed and a standard of that time.

Sound quality for Java and the whole album is, of course, typical of the time and analog recording technology. For me this gives it a little bit of a nostalgic feel. Al Hirt's performances stand the test of time. He is a New Orleans original and Java is a great example of his art.",1482969600,5

99683,12631,1641,"The popular American actress and singer Debbie Reynolds broke into show business at the tender age of 19 back in 1950 with her portrayal of singer Helen Kane in the feature film ""Three Little Words"".  Her performance earned her a Golden Globe Award for Most Promising Newcomer.  Just a few months later Debbie would score a Top Ten hit with her first single ""Aba Daba Honeymoon"".  And after her memorable performance in the 1952 musical comedy ""Singin"" In The Rain"" with Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor the name Debbie Reynolds would be forever etched in the folklore of Hollywood.  Given her vocal prowess many people expected Debbie Reynolds to become a fixture on the Billboard pop charts.  You might be surprised to learn that this simply was not the case.

It would be another five years and 14 films before Debbie Reynolds would have another hit record.  It does not appear that a recording career was a top priority for her.  In 1957 she co-starred with Leslie Nielson and Walter Brennan in the romantic comedy ""Tammy And The Bachelor"".  The song ""Tammy"" made its debut in that film and was nominated for the 1957 Academy Award for Best Original Song.  The tune was a massive hit with the record-buying public as well.  ""Tammy"" would remain on the Billboard Hot 100 for an unheard of 31 weeks and spend 5 big weeks at the top of the charts.  Over the next couple of years Debbie Reynolds would have a couple of more hits but nothing could compare with the popularity of ""Tammy"".  i suppose that in this day and age most people would consider a song like ""Tammy"" to be pure unadulterated schmaltz.  But in my opinion, there is something to be said for such schmaltz.  Even as a teenager in the 1960's I loved this song.  This is the original hit recording you would remember from the radio.",1482969600,5

99686,17197,19827,"This is the real poison. FZ once recanted that the tapes from ""those years""1966-70 were badly damaged from what I call ""acute acetate disorder"". This is the original mixes and reproduction ...clean and correct ambience apparently  the only the second attempt to bring it to a digital media audience. Some lyrics he actually had an attack of conscious about reproducing, so, uh, he didn't. But there are severe depictions of substance abuse at every level in the lyric, some subtle and others mothers blatant. He knew or envisioned the imagery of pseudo-hipness...we all know FZ didn't dawdle with his consciousness. But he knew what it do, and dey do it, and dey buys the records. Nevertheless, this masterpiece of iconic 60's mayhem is a treasure for any Zappa aficionado . Though it may not have the digital coolness of our times, like my recordings, the resilience  and absolute preponderance of operatic brilliance for a doomed race is an occurrence unparalleled  in musicologist's history.",1482969600,5

99721,1805,18602,"Just so you know, I really want to love Skillet. Ive really enjoyed much of their work including their last release Rise but theres something brewing that I don't like and Unleashed displays it: John Coopers singing is dominating all the songs. The band doesnt take long enough to let any of these songs breathe and develop so they all end up sounding really, really similar; really formulaic. And its sounding old. I realize that Skillet is a modern rock band who has always placed a lot of emphasis on a lot of vocals and I like Coopers voice (most of the time) but too much sometimes is just thattoo much. I think that this album is an example of that and it reminds me of Creeds last release (Full Circle) where pretty early on I wanted Scott Stapp to stop singing so I could listen to the music (mind you, I like Stapps vocals). While Unleashed doesnt sink down to quite that level it gets close and I wish the songs were more interesting, more musically developed, and that Cooper would hold back and let the music sit on its own more or that he and drummer Jen Ledger would share vocals more than they do. This at least helps change up the dynamics between songs and helps make the album as a whole more listenable. As such I Want To Live is one of the albums better songs IMO both for the male/female vocals and for the symphonic music. Stars and Lions may be my favorite songs off this release and they are more synth dance songs than rock songs. Meanwhile songs like Feel Invincible, Back From the Dead, Undefeated, and especially tracks Out of Hell and Burn It Down generate the my main criticisms. So all Im saying is that I want to see them break away from the mold (stadium anthems) and play around an album throughout its track list. Their last great album was Collide. I think they have one more great album in them. Heres hoping.",1483056000,3

99723,11742,2330,"This album is so amazing! I love each and every song on this album, each song is either deep and has an amazing message or is a dance song that just makes you wanna dance! Some standouts would be ""Bang Dem Sticks"", ""Mr. Almost"" (My favorite song on the album!), ""Title"", and ""Lips Are Movin""! This album is more for pre-teens to teens as it does contain some references to alcohol (""Walkashame"") and has some cursing (""All About That Bass"", ""Title"", ""Bang Dem Sticks"" ext.) Would recommend this album though, it's definitely a 5 star album!",1483056000,5

99771,56,19823,"It is just so sad, whenever someone young and talented throws their life away, and dies at a much earlier age. That sadly was the case with George Michael. Sadly, he passed away on December 25th, 2016 and many people have been really taking a hard look at his legacy, and the beauty that he had shown as a artist. From boy toy, to gay activist, he had so many remarkable and beautiful songs that struck at the soul of the heart alone. That was why he had been a really brilliant and beautiful singer and songwriter. One of my favorite songs from his landmark solo debut album, Faith is Father Figure. It is a lovely song that really shows brilliance and beauty from the soul's eyes. It is a track that I think shows how brilliant George was working his craft so well, at the heart of the matter, when it comes to love. It is a remarkable song, that still delivers so nobly well. If you are just discovering George Michael, because of the impact of his tragic death, than you'll definitely want to check out this song. I recommend it.

However, it isn't perfect. There is some popping/feedback on Why's it so Hard on disc 1 and again on La Isla Bonita on disc 2.

Also, there isn't much in the way of artwork, pictures, or liner notes, much the same as the Blond Ambition set. But that is to be expected from these small company releases. Neither Madonna nor Warner Bros is involved with these 2 Tour releases.

Among other renditions, I love the Simon Rattle 10th with Berlin (cut my teeth on this one), and also respect Eliahu Inbal's, and will return to them both. But this new one with Dausgaard and the Seattle pretty much goes right to the top of the list. If you believe Mahler's 10th can be performed, and if you believe Deryk Cooke's performing version is the way to go, all I can add is: ""wow...this is IT.""

99891,17214,17930,"I am a long-time fan of Bruce Hornsby, have seem him in concert, own virtually all of his albums, etc.  As much as I love the 80s and early 90s material which everyone (ok, classic rock fans) knows, I have most enjoyed his more recent work where he has branched out and kept exploring different musical styles and ideas.  My favorite BH album may just be Spirit Trail from 1998, the sprawling double-disc that many critics described as ""self-indulgent"" but was really just the man being himself with all of his musical quirks out in the open.  Since that time we've had stabs at hip-hop (Big Swing Face), sophisticated but decidedly weird pop (Halcyon Days), bluegrass (Cluck Ol' Hen with Ricky Skaggs), a sprawling live album which re-worked some of his best recent material (Bride of the Noisemakers), solo concerts, and now an album which features BH on an entirely different instrument than the one which made him famous.  I can see why BH may have lost everyone but the die-hards by now, but for those of us who love BH's musical adventurousness this is a great time to be among his fan base.

This new disc is full of great new compositions as well as some re-worked classics.  I am not going to do a full track-by-track review but I will say that (going in the order in which they appear) ""Over the Rise"" is a great and engaging opener, ""Soon Enough"" is deeply touching, ""M.I.A. in M.I.A.M.I."" and ""Tipping"" are hilarious, ""Rehab Reunion"" is clever, ""Tropical Cashmere Sweater"" is moving, ""TSA Man"" is again hilarious and timely, ""The Valley Road"" is a worthy re-imagining of a classic, and ""Celestial Railroad"" is a real (nice, soulful) surprise.  The music as a whole has a stripped-down appeal and is rootsy without sacrificing production quality.  As other reviewers I have read have pointed out, BH has never sounded more relevant.  This is a classic album and also very much of our times.  It's a real treasure.

I hope BH keeps expanding his musical horizons (no disco or emo though!).  I have really been enjoying everything he has done for the past few decades.",1483228800,5

To know though that proceeds from the sale of this EP go to a charity most important to Hackett is reason enough to buy it though ...

100067,17233,12734,"Well, I am alive after listening to your album! Its highly charged and I could not sit still through Live It Up. I got up and boogied to that sound! One the songs that has stayed with me is The Unknown Rockstar. It starts off with a sound that creates a feeling of standing on the edge of something bigger than life and goes into this flow which is equivalent to that moment when slipping into the flow of destiny where everything comes into alignment to support  the journey. It has an epic anthem element leaving  a trail of inspiration to follow.  It's a happy sound! I think Im falling in love is quite sweet with that innocent spirit which often comes when falling in love with anything. It nicely captures the experience of falling in love.",1483315200,5

100081,17233,18440,Where I Left Off is a pleasing body of work. Your mastery of the keyboard is highlighted in each sound. The movement through each note delivers a specific gesture of emotion. Although this is very confident and assertive the listener is comforted and carried on a journey filled with adventures. Ohh Baby is charged with the movement of the sounds lead by the keyboard. The play between the horns and the keyboard arouses the soul. And thats just the first song! Seasons Change is memorable with its certain sweetness. The composition is gorgeous with the ebb and flow of the keyboard in the lead and then saxophone adding a sparkle to the already shimmering fluidity. Your work is stimulating and leaves the listener unquestionably satisfied.,1483315200,5

100106,17233,17374,"I had the great pleasure to listen your album Spellbinder. It is mysterious, explorative and otherworldly. There is a back and forth of cosmic energy and earth energy. There is a push to get beyond the boundaries and a mission to bring the energy back here. When listening to it I feel like a cool kid that gets to go on an expedition of the great unknown beyond this earth. There is a level of mastery, sophistication with the musicians in this collection of music. A beautiful choreography of sounds the way everyone plays off each other in the landscape of each song with a special attention to percussion. This is heard throughout the album and is much appreciated. The percussion adds a force that is often missing. Perhaps its your love and dedication to the drums that comes through. It does something to the composition and the life of each song. There is energy in this album and I am inspired with each listen. This album has me spellbound!",1483315200,5

100121,428,17785,"Finally!!  A proper multi-disc boxed set by the other main songwriter in The Beatles!  It's about time ...

While John and George have had their own boxed sets released in the past (and good ones, too!!) and Ringo has released a 3-disc ""Anthology"" of himself with his All-Starr Band project(s), Sir Paul was the only one left to compile his massive amount of recordings into a nice collection of exactly what this boxed set holds within it!  You will NOT be bored with any filler or whatever from start to finish.

It's Paul Bloody McCartney, fer crissakes!!!

100252,12631,9539,"Jim Croce was a singer/songwriter/guitarist from Philadelphia who burst onto the scene in the summer of 1973 with a #1 single ""You Don't Mess Around With Jim"".  Jim achieved his success the old fashioned way.  During the day he drove a truck and swung a hammer to support his young family and at night he played his music at bars and clubs all over Philly.  His first three singles all made the national Top 40 and in then in the spring of 1973 his 4th release ""Bad, Bad Leroy Brown"" would become his first #1 hit.  It appeared for all the world that Jim Croce was going to be a fixture on the American music scene for a very long time.  Here was an artist that the average Joe could relate to and root for.

Then on September 20, 1973 tragedy struck.  Jim Croce was killed in a plane crash in Natchitoches, LA.  He was just 30 years old.  Jim Croce had a backlog of unreleased material in the can and his label ABC continued to release a new single every few months.  His final Top Ten hit was released in February of 1974.  While I loved all of his singles I think ""I'll Have To Say I Love You In A Song"" is my favorite.  The song spent 14 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart peaking at #9.  This is the original hit single recording you would remember from the radio.",1483401600,5

100256,8721,11974,"THE ORIGINAL DISCO MAN (originally Polydor PD-6212) was released in 1979, preceded that year by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TAKE-A-LOOK-AT-THOSE-CAKES/dp/B001AS0WHC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TAKE A LOOK AT THOSE CAKES</a>&nbsp;and followed by 1980's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/PEOPLE/dp/B000091EXJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">PEOPLE</a>. THE ORIGINAL DISCO MAN was to be a comeback album for James Brown. As the 1970's progressed, traditional soul and funk began taking a back seat to disco. A side effect of this was that venues for live music began to dry up, venues which were Brown's bread and butter on the road. People were more interested in dancing and partying to the latest records than hearing an artist regurgitate their past triumphs. Unfortunately Brown's latest records were going nowhere as well. His last top ten R&B single was 1976's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Get-Up-Offa-That-Thing/dp/B00LSYYK8U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Get Up Offa That Thing</a>,"" which was his first top ten since late 1974. James' habit of throwing out singles every month to see what would stick was costing his label Polydor money, and his album sales were hurting just as bad. So Polydor made The Godfather was an offer he was in no position to refuse, if he agreed to have an outside producer, the label would promote the results with everything they had. Eventually the chosen man for the job was Brad Shapiro. Shapiro was a deep soul producer who worked out of Muscle Shoals, utilizing the famous studio and band. In the past he had produced such greats as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wilson-Pickett/dp/B000ESSTLA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wilson Pickett</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Betty-Wright/dp/B000MV91W0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Betty Wright</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Millie-Jackson/dp/B00000715F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Millie Jackson</a>. Shapiro wrote the bulk of the album with Muscle Shoals keyboardist Randy McCormick, and cut the music at the famous Alabama studio. James recorded his vocals later in Nashville. The resulting album was one of Brown's strongest in a long time, and Polydor gave it the push they promised. Unfortunately it was not the success that everyone had hoped for. The album only reached #37 in the R&B charts and a desultory #152 Pop. The lead single, the self-explanatory ""It's Too Funky In Here,"" the song that sealed Brown's agreement to use Shapiro, only reached #15 R&B. The second and last single ""Star Generation"" barely made #63. James would only release three more albums on Polydor, the studio albums PEOPLE and NONSTOP! and the double-live&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/HOT-ON-THE-ONE/dp/B000025XIV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">HOT ON THE ONE</a>. At least James went out with a bang, albeit a restrained one, HOT ON THE ONE, while no chart hit, documented that Brown and current group of J.B.'s still had it. The CD of THE ORIGINAL DISCO MAN was available for a hot second in 2003 and then disappeared. Most of the tracks however can be found on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-SINGLES-Vol-10-1975-1979/dp/B004J2FJG0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE SINGLES Vol. 10: 1975 - 1979</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-SINGLES-Vol-11-1979-1981/dp/B005HWUD94/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE SINGLES Vol. 11: 1979-1981</a>.......

What a message this song gives, and Rihanna's delivery is amazing. Reminds us that we have more power than we sometimes give ourselves credit for. That ""wall"" that we face that we think might be the end of us could be what is between us and the breakthrough we are looking for. The hurt we think we might experience is the chance we have to take to move forward.
